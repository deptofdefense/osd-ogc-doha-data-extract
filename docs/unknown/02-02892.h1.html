<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 24, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 
11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked. The SOR was based on foreign influence (guideline B) concerns 
because of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members (mother, father, brothers, and sisters).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant filed a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">signed and sworn, </SPAN>notarized response, dated March 19, 2003, to the allegations set forth in the SOR. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a clearance decision based 
on a hearing record b</SPAN>efore a DOHA Administrative Judge. The case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge, but because of medical reasons, the 
case was reassigned to me to conduct a hearing on July 25, 2003.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on August 22, 2003, and the hearing was held 
on September 9, 2003. </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered one documentary exhibit (Government Exhibit 1), and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through counsel, 
offered 26 documentary exhibits (Applicant Exhibits A through Z) and offered the testimony of his sister, his wife, his supervisor, and himself.  All exhibits 
were entered into evidence. The transcript (TR) was received on September 18, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family 
members are not United States citizens, some of them reside in Saudi Arabia, and they may be subject to duress. The SOR contains nine allegations, 1.a. 
through 1.i., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all nine allegations. These allegations are incorporated as 
findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony of the witnesses at the hearing, and 
the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44 year old employee of a defense contractor. He <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Yemen in 1959. He and his family moved from Yemen to Saudi Arabia in 1967.  
After spending some time in England, and then returning to Saudi Arabia, he moved to the United States in 1985 and became a naturalized United States citizen 
in 1998. He received a bachelor of science degree from a United States university in 1998 in computer science. His wife, whom he married in 1986,  is a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United 
States citizen, and they have one son and one daughter. He also has one other daughter.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father and mother are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Yemen and reside for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the majority of the time </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in Saudi Arabia</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. They also own a home in the United States,  in the 
same state as that of Applicant and his sister. They spend some time every year in the United States.  Applicant has three brothers and three sisters, who are 
citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Yemen and reside in Saudi Arabia</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant also has one brother and one sister who are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Yemen and reside in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the United States. 
Applicant has sporadic contact with his parents, more frequent when they are in the United States. Applicant testified that his  parents are retired and neither 
one ever worked for the government of Yemen or Saudi Arabia.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He also testified that neither his brothers or sisters </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">work for the government of Yemen or Saudi 
Arabia.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative 
Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Each 
adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. </P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of foreign influence. Applicant's 
immediate family members, his parents,  three sisters, and three brother are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Yemen and reside in Saudi Arabia</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>The <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Saudi Arabia</SPAN>n residency of 
members of Applicant's immediate family creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it 
makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require 
Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him. ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). </SPAN>The result is <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a very heavy 
burden of showing that these family members do not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002).  Applicant has not met this burden.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified to a hypothetical question at the hearing that he would not betray the United States if his family was threatened (Tr. at 117,118).  Since there 
has been no actual set of circumstances that occurred similar to the hypothetical fact pattern, I can not give his statement serious consideration. ISCR Case No. 
02-26826 (November 12, 2003).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Based on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>'s family status as citizens of Yemen and residents of Saudi Arabia, Disqualifying Condition E2.A2.1.2.1. applies.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I cannot conclude</SPAN> that 
his family is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly, Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition </SPAN>E2.A2.1.3.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> does not apply to this case. 
Guideline B is found against Applicant.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has failed </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to mitigate these security concerns, thereby failing to demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him the clearance. </SPAN></P>
