<P>Applicant mitigates his  recurrent marijuana use, purchases and his non-recent arrests for marijuana possession.  His marijuana involvement was never more 
than occasional, and last occurred  in September 2002.  He is highly regarded by his superiors and colleagues for his good judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness, and he credibly convinces that he will not return to marijuana use in the future.  Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on February 14, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on May 10, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing 
on June 3, 2004.  A hearing was convened on June 3, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses 
(including himself) and 14 exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on June 15, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the hearing, Applicant offered two affidavits (exhibits K and L), to the Government objected to by the Government as to portions addressing factual 
matters pertaining to the extent of Applicant's marijuana involvement.  The objected to portions of the affidavits were stricken as to paragraphs 4 through 7(1) 
of exhibit K and paragraph 3 of exhibit L, without prejudice to Applicant to brief the raised hearsay issues during the allotted 14 days to supplement the record.  
The Government was afforded an additional 14 days to respond. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Within the time permitted, the parties addressed the hearsay issue associated with exhibits K and L.  Historically, the Appeal Board has broadly construed the 
reach of hearsay exceptions to Rule 803 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Police reports, medical records and business records that qualify as exceptions have 
been generally approved as admissible, even though the records include statements that might separately be considered hearsay declarations.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case 
No. 98-0265 (March 1999) (business records represent recognized exception) to hearsay rule;  ISCR Case No. 96-0575 (July 1997)(medical questionnaire 
admissible that is duplicative of admitted statements and does not involve controverted issue).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These decisions follow the general guidance provided by the 
federal circuits when considering hearsay prohibitions in the context of making security clearance decisions.  <EM>Cf. Kewley v. Department of Health and Human 
Services, </EM>153 F.3d 1357, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 1998); <EM>Hoska v. United States Dept. of the Army, </EM>677 F.2d 131, 138-39 (DC Cir. 1982).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, the Appeal Board 
has been careful to limit the admissibility of third-party statements covering controverted fact issues that are not covered by any recognized hearsay exception.  
<EM>See </EM> ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 1997); ISCR Case No. 90-2069 (March 1992); DISCR Case No. 88-2173 (September 1990)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both exhibits K and L contain hearsay accounts of a factual nature.  While they corroborate Applicant's own accounts of the respective circumstances 
surrounding his May 1978 arrest and the source of his marijuana in 1999, they are a part of affidavits developed specifically for the hearing in the instant case.  
As such, they are not covered by any recognized hearsay exception and reflect statements generally barred by the hearsay rule in federal court and 
administrative proceedings alike.  To accept these statements covering pivotal fact issues would weaken, if not eliminate, what is left of hearsay limits 
recognized in DOHA administrative proceedings.  Nothing provided in the post-hearing submissions of the parties supports a construction of the hearsay rule in 
DOHA proceedings that permits the consideration of hearsay statements not colorably covered  by a recognized hearsay exception.  Accordingly, the factual 
portions of exhibits K and L that were stricken at hearing must remain so. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Applicant was afforded 14 days to provide Appeal Board guidance re: making risk of recurrence assessments based on past use 
of illegal substances and an applicant's likelihood of recurrence in the future based on a negative credibility assessment.  The Government was afforded an 
additional 14 days to respond.  With extensions granted Applicant to facilitate response to the trier's referenced Appeal Board decision at hearing, both parties 
responded with their timely briefing of the issue.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have (a) used marijuana from 1978 to mid-2002, (b) purchased marijuana, (c) been arrested in March 1978 for 
possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia (charges dismissed) and (d) been arrested in May 1978 for possession of marijuana (charge dismissed).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied using marijuana for the dates and frequencies alleged, and denied possessing marijuana on either occasion he was 
arrested in 1978. He claimed more limited use dating to 1976, followed by more recent occasional use during a brief period in 1998 prior to his divorce being 
finalized.  He claimed to have obtained the marijuana he used during this brief last period from his brother for no cost.   Applicant claimed excellent career 
progress with his current employer and a loving, enduring relationship with his daughter and step-daughter from his last marriage. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old senior systems engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  He was introduced to marijuana in college and 
estimates to have used it about five times between 1976 and 1980 (influenced by peer pressure), again in1999 when he resumed use on an occasional basis 
following his separation from his spouse of 13 years, and one last time in 2002 following the breakup of a three-year relationship. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1978, Applicant was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a friend who had marijuana in his car when the police pulled them over and arrested both of 
them for possession of marijuana and narcotic equipment.  Applicant later pled no contest to the possession charge and received deferred adjudication on this 
charge; while the drug paraphernalia charge was dropped (ex. G).  Applicant, in turn, was advised the remaining drug possession charges would be expunged 
from his police record.  Applicant assures the marijuana was not his.  His assurances are not controverted by the evidence in the record and are accepted, 
notwithstanding the absence of any documentation of expungement.  .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested again for marijuana possession in May 1978.  This charge, too, was dismissed following applicant's not guilty plea (<EM>see</EM> ex. H).  As with 
his earlier March 1978 arrest, he assures the marijuana found in the vehicle he was riding in was not his, and he had nothing to do with the arrest.  His 
assurances are accepted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During his 15-year marriage to his former spouse (spanning 1985 and 2000), Applicant avoided marijuana, as well as other illegal substances, save for his 
isolated use in 1999 (correcting his earlier 1998 estimate he provided in his answer).  Random drug tests he submitted to during his eight year employment with 
a previous employer (1989 to 1997) consistently produced negative results (<EM>see </EM>ex. E).  Applicant's former spouse corroborates Applicant's claims of isolated 
marijuana use.  She was always very much against the use of illegal drugs of any kind, and has a pretty good sense of smell for marijuana (R.T., at 21-22).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Marriage difficulties emerged between Applicant and his now former spouse in the late 1990s.  Unable to keep their marriage on solid footing following months 
of marriage counseling (<EM>see</EM> ex. A), they separated in August 1999.  Their marriage produced one daughter of their own, with whom they share custody (R.T., at 
120), and a step-daughter from the spouse's previous marriage.  Upon Applicant's petition for dissolution of their marriage, their divorce was finalized in 
arch 2000 (<EM>see</EM> exs. B and D).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's separation from his former spouse caused him considerable emotional stress.  He became quite depressed after his wife asked him to move out of 
his house and away from his children and pets.  With his sleep disrupted, he turned to marijuana to help him cope with the effects of losing his family.  His use 
of marijuana over the ensuing year was sporadic: He used it infrequently, on occasional evenings at home to aid his sleep.  Most of it he obtained from his 
brother, on no more than ten occasions.  Applicant obtained it from both his brother and another in the surf shop where the former worked in return for repair 
work,  never for cash or its equivalent (R.T., at 43-44).  Applicant's exchanges, which collectively reflect small amounts, represent legally identifiable 
purchases for his personal use, which Applicant did not fully appreciate at the time to be the case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since his 1999 marital separation, Applicant continues to maintain a vigorous schedule of work (estimated to be 50 to 100 hours a week) and recreational 
pursuits (primarily coaching little league).  This intense level of activity leaves him little time for socializing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is periodically subjected to random drug tests at work, just as he was with a previous FAA contractor (albeit, never called for testing) between 1992 
and 1997 (R.T., at 44-51).  He has consistently tested negatively in these tests (<EM>see</EM> ex. F).  He does admit to one recurrent use of marijuana since 1999.  He 
smoked a single joint on about three occasions over the course of a week in September 2002 after learning that a woman he become involved with had serious 
undisclosed financial issues (R.T., at 58-59).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other than his isolated recurrent use of marijuana in September in 2002 (which he promptly reported to his first line supervisor), Applicant has not used illegal 
drugs of any kind, expresses deep remorse for his mistakes of judgment in returning to marijuana, and assures he will not return to illegal substances in the 
future (<EM>see</EM> ex. M; R.T., at 118-19).  Absent evidence of his further use before or after September 2002, no adverse inferences may be drawn of Applicant's 
likely return to marijuana use in the foreseeable future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his ex-spouse, members of his management team, and past and present colleagues who have worked closely with him.  He is 
valued for his needed technical skills, experience, sound judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness (<EM>see</EM> exs. I, J and K; R.T., at 17-18).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These revised Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying 
Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  
The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges 
must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  
Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1  Any drug use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2   Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1   The drug involvement was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3  A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant brings a praiseworthy civilian work record to these proceedings, in addition to a history of recurrent marijuana use and isolated purchases.  
Applicant's recurrent  involvement with marijuana over a twenty-five period raises security significant issues his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness 
required for eligibility to access classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's marijuana use, while recurrent, was never carried to addictive or abusive levels. Introduced to the substance in college (in 1976) he enjoyed a 19-year period of abstinence before returning to it again in 1999 for several weeks following his break-up with his spouse of many years, and one final time in 
September 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's recurrent  use of marijuana in college, in 1999, and again in 2002, along with his marijuana purchases and possession arrests in 1999, are sufficient 
to invoke two of the disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drugs, <EM>i.e., </EM>DC 1 (any drug abuse) and DC 2 (illegal drug possession, including 
cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution).  Because his 1978 possession arrests did not result in any cognizable adjudication of guilt, 
no inferences of abusive use of marijuana can be drawn from these arrests. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">misconduct predictions, generally, may not be based on supposition or suspicion.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356 
(April1998).  The Appeal Board has consistently held that an unfavorable credibility determination concerning an applicant is not a substitute for record 
evidence that the applicant used marijuana since his last recorded use, or based on his past use is likely to resume usage in the future.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (May 2004). Based on his own creditable testimony, the testimonials of his character references and his negative drug screens, over the past two years, 
Applicant may invoke MC 1 (non recency of the drug involvement) and MC 3 (demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future).  While Applicant's 
recurrent marijuana use over 20 plus years raises some questions over the strength of his avoidance assurances, it is not enough to prevent Applicant's 
successful mitigation of the issue.  Applicant's recurrent use of marijuana between 1976 and 2002, has been interrupted by long periods of non use, and most 
importantly has never been more than occasional. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's assurances that his marijuana involvement is a thing of the past are entitled to acceptance based on his limited periods of active marijuana use in the 
past, the absence of any drug activity attributed to him over the past 21 months and his very strong character references from his former spouse, employer, 
friends and former colleagues who have worked closely with him. Considering the all of the developed evidence of record, Applicant mitigates security 
concerns associated with his recurrent use and possession of marijuana.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.d of 
Guideline H. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
