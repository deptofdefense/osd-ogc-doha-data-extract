<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 22, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings 
and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated October 13, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing 
record. In his Answer, Applicant admits to the SOR allegations (subparagraphs 1.a - 1.c, and 1.f).  He denies 1.d and 1.e, and he admits and denies, in part, 
subparagraph 1.g.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 7, 2003, this case was originally assigned to Administrative Judge Wilmeth, but on January 30, 2003, because of caseload consideration, the case 
was reassigned to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to the parties on January 22, 2003, and the hearing was 
held on February 25, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 11) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, 
offered no documentary exhibits and offered his own testimony. After the hearing, the record was left open, and  Applicant offered five  documentary exhibits 
(Exhibits A - E) none of which were objected to by Department Counsel. </SPAN>The transcript (TR) was received on<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> March 4, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 54 year old employee of a defense contractor.<STRONG> </STRONG>He is married with two children and has a Bachelor of Arts degree.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a troubling, history of financial difficulties, the most significant being substantial indebtedness to the IRS. While Applicant  filed his federal 
income tax returns for each year that it was required, and made what he believed were proper payments, he was continually informed by the IRS that he had 
underestimated the amount that he owed </SPAN>for each year. He was first notified in 1986 or 1987 that he had not paid the proper amount of federal income tax for 
tax year 1984.  Thereafter, he was informed that he had not paid sufficient tax for tax years 1985, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1998 and 2000. 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> began making payments to the IRS for the amount he owed, and continued making payment for approximately 15 years. However, after 15 years, he 
estimates that he currently owes approximately $49,000. (TR at 30-34.) </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> testified that he was informed in 2001 by the IRS that, based on his financial situation, he no longer was required to continue to make payments on 
this debt. Since then he has</P> 
 
<P>made no further payments. (TR at 34-35.) Approximately $50,000. is still due and owing from the Applicant to the IRS, and there is no current plan in place to 
reduce that debt. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant owes a state for tax year 1991, approximately $5,207. Subsequent to the hearing, Applicant submitted a document, dated October 21, 2002, titled 
"Offer in Compromise" which established that he offered to settle with the state department of taxation for the sum of $1,000.  (Applicant's <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Exhibits A.)</SPAN> While 
this document establishes Applicant's offer, there has been no evidence of a  response from the state department of taxation.  Therefore, I must conclude that 
this debt is still due and owing.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant introduced Applicant's <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Exhibits B, a copy of a cancelled check</SPAN> to a national bank in the amount of $ 455.98. This check is, in part, for the debt cited 
in SOR allegation 1.c., and I conclude that this debt has been resolved.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant introduced Applicant's <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Exhibits C, a copy of a cancelled check</SPAN> to the time share resort in the amount of $ 1258.38. This check is, in part,  for the debt 
cited in SOR allegation 1.d., and I conclude that this debt has been resolved.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> testified that the debt for a cemetery headstone for his sister has been paid by his family. (TR at 52-53.) Applicant introduced Applicant's <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Exhibits D, 
which shows a balance of $ 0</SPAN>, owed by Applicant to the creditor cited in SOR allegation 1.e. I conclude that this debt has been paid. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>	</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In 1994, Applicant and his wife had their debt of approximately $59,040 discharged in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Applicant testified that the bankruptcy filing was 
necessitated by the debts of his wife prior to their marriage.  However, the bankruptcy record  indicates that a significant amount of those debts were incurred by 
Applicant, himself. (Government Exhibit 5.)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's expenses exceed his net income by approximately $300 each month.  (TR at 56-60, Government Exhibit 7.) With this  negative net remainder at the 
end of each month, it is unlikely that Applicant can resolve his financial difficulties.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully 
considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising 
or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn. . .).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness and his current non-payment on 
the most significant delinquent accounts to the IRS and a state department of taxation. The record evidence shows Applicant has a history of financial 
difficulties attributed to financial irresponsibility. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3. Regarding Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3, which regards debts that result from circumstances beyond the person's control,  I find it not 
applicable to this case. While Applicant's indebtedness was partially due to circumstances beyond his control, specifically the debts of his wife, the majority of 
Applicant's debts occurred as a result of his own conduct. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appears to have made a good-faith effort to resolve some of his lesser debts, but his remaining indebtedness, particularly to the IRS, is too large, and 
the absence of a repayment plan and negative cash remainder every month is too great a continuing problem, to conclude that Applicant's financial problems are 
behind him. Until he can establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve 
Guideline F. against Applicant, and I conclude Applicant has not established, at this time, that it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" that he should 
be granted the privilege of a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
