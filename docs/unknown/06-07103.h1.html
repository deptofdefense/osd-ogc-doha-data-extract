<P>Applicant, his parents, and his seven siblings were all born in the U.S. His two older sisters moved to Israel in the late 1960s. They and the children they have 
raised there are now citizens of and reside in Israel. Applicant's contacts with his sisters are infrequent. His relationship with his nieces and nephews and an 
Israeli brother-in-law is casual and even less frequent. Applicant has actually seen his sisters and their families only six times in the past 35 years. His five other 
siblings, three of whom served in the U.S. military, are citizens of and live in the U.S. He has mitigated the security concerns about possible foreign influence.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On October 24, 2004, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P). After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, 
adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant Applicant a position of trust. On July 26, 2006, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise 
security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline B (foreign influence).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant timely responded to the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on October 13, 2006, but was transferred to 
me on November 17, 2006. I convened a hearing on January 9, 2007, at which the parties appeared as scheduled. The parties stipulated to the admission of all 
seven exhibits proffered by the government (Gx. 1- 7).<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant testified and introduced a single, nine-page exhibit (Ax. A), which was admitted without 
objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 17, 2007.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government alleged in the SOR that two of Applicant's sisters are citizens of and reside in Israel (SOR &para; 1.a); that the husband of one of his sisters is a 
citizen of and resides in Israel (SOR  &para; 1.b); that Applicant has five nieces and nephews who are citizens of and reside in Israel (SOR &para;  1.c); that two of his 
nephews are serving in the Israeli army (SOR &para; 1.d); and that Applicant traveled to Israel in 2001 (SOR &para; 1.e). Applicant admitted all but SOR &para; 1.d, and his 
admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of 
relevant fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 49 years old and has worked as a programmer/analyst in the health care and medical insurance industry since at least 1990. Since November 1999, 
he worked for a company that has contracted to manage medical insurance claims and information for TriCare, the Department of Defense (DoD) medical 
insurance system for military personnel and their families.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2004, he was required, as part of his current employer's contract with DoD, to undergo a trustworthiness determination for access to the same information 
he has been handling since he started there. The ensuing background investigation revealed, inter alia, that Applicant's two older sisters, now in their mid-50s, 
are citizens of and reside in Israel. All of Applicant's family members were born and raised in the United States. Before his sisters moved to Israel in the late 
1960s and started families there, Applicant's family had no connection to Israel, nor were any of them of Israeli descent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's oldest sister moved to Israel in connection with volunteer work there. She stayed after being given a scholarship to study physical therapy at an 
Israeli school. She later married an Israeli, who works for a large pharmaceutical company there. They have three children, all now grown. Applicant's other 
older sister moved to Israel in the late 1960s under similar circumstances. She married an Israeli and raised four children, but is now divorced and working for 
the same pharmaceutical company as her brother-in-law. All of Applicant's nieces and nephews also have U.S. citizenship derived from their mothers' U.S. 
citizenship. One of the children lives in Brazil, but the rest still reside in Israel.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All Israeli citizens are required to complete two years of military service. Applicant's sisters and their children in Israel have fulfilled their military obligations. 
Applicant thinks, but is not certain, some of his nieces or nephews may still be subject to reserve recall. Aside from mandatory military service, none of 
Applicant's relatives in Israel have ever had any connection to the Israeli government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also has four brothers and a sister who are U.S. citizens and live in the U.S. His sister is an engineer who works for a contractor in support of U.S. 
Navy facilities inspections. One of his brothers is a programmer for a drug testing company. Another brother served in the U.S. Air Force, and has worked for 
a large defense contractor for at least 25 years. Another brother served in the U.S. Navy, and now works for a large U.S. corporation as a nuclear engineer. 
The fourth brother served in the U.S. Army, and now works for a medical laboratory equipment company.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Israel in 1987 and 2001 to see his sisters. In the early 1990s and in 2003, one of his sisters and her family came to the U.S. to visit 
Applicant and other family members. One of his nieces came to the U.S. for several months in 2004, and she visited Applicant for four days before returning to 
Israel. Applicant's other sister visited in 2005. Applicant sends birthday cards to his sisters and speaks with them by telephone one or two times a year. He has 
little contact with his Israeli brother-in-law, and it is rare for him to speak with any of his nieces and nephews unless they happen to answer the phone when he 
calls. Applicant has a natural concern for the welfare of his brother-in-law and nieces and nephews because of their relation to his sisters, but these are not 
"loving relationship[s]."<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Israel is one of the most active countries engaged in military and industrial espionage. Their efforts have been directed at hostile and friendly countries alike, 
including the United States.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Overall, however, their interests are generally aligned with ours, especially where matters of regional security are concerned. 
Since its founding in 1948, Israel and the United States have had a close friendship based, in large measure, on common democratic values. Israel has an 
advanced, industrial market, and its government is characterized as a "vibrant parliamentary democracy."<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has an excellent work record. A co-worker, who has known him professionally and personally since 1990, praised his job performance and avers 
Applicant is trustworthy, reliable, and loyal to the United States. Applicant's performance evaluations show he exceeded his employer's goals and expectations 
of him in the most recent reporting period.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to sensitive information.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Each 
trustworthiness determination must reflect consideration of both disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each adjudicative issue 
applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Each determination must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of all available 
relevant and material information,<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and it must reflect the adjudication process outlined in the Directive at Section E2.2.1.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN> The presence or absence of a 
disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to sensitive information.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Trustworthiness determinations are intended solely to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> for an applicant to receive or continue 
to have access to sensitive  information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
against the applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, the burden 
then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. As with security clearances, no one has a "right" to such access.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Thus, an 
applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. Access to sensitive information is a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. 
The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who 
will protect sensitive information pertaining to the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Influence. </STRONG>The government presented sufficient evidence to support the factual allegations in the SOR. As to SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, two of 
Applicant's sisters are citizens of and reside in Israel. The husband of one of his sisters, and all but one of his nieces and nephews are also citizens of and reside 
in Israel. These facts raise security concerns under Guideline B; that is, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, 
and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. 
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other 
countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN> Guideline B DC 1<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN> must be considered in light of the available information about Applicant's Israeli relatives. Certainly, his sisters 
qualify as immediate family members, and it may initially be presumed Applicant is also tied by affection to his brother-in-law and his nieces and nephews.</P> 
 
<P>As to SOR &para; 1.d, Applicant denied this allegation and asserted his nephews have completed their military obligation. The government did not present evidence 
to support this controverted issue of fact,<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN> and I find this allegation for the Applicant. As to SOR &para; 1.e, available information showed that Applicant traveled 
to Israel in 2001, as alleged. However, travel to a foreign country is not in and of itself disqualifying. Such allegations merely plead evidence of the strength of 
his ties to his sisters. I find for Applicant as to this allegation. </P> 
 
<P>Weighing the fact he has traveled to Israel to see his sisters, along with other available information about his relationship with his sisters and their families, it is 
apparent that Applicant's contact with them over the past 35 years has been infrequent. He traveled to Israel twice; once in 1987 and once in 2001, to see his 
sisters. One sister traveled here twice between 1990 and 2003. The other visited once in 2005. Some of his nieces and nephews have also visited the U.S. and 
seen Applicant a total of three times in the past 16 years. Further, Applicant has infrequent telephone contact with his sisters each year, even less contact with 
his nieces or nephews, and almost no contact with his brother-in-law. On these facts, as to his brother-in-law and nieces and nephews, MC 3<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies. MC 3 
also is relevant when assessing the risk associated with his ties to his sisters. Their contacts are clearly infrequent, and, even allowing for the fact Applicant 
cares for his sisters, their relationship is not so close as to pose an unacceptable risk to the government in this context. Applicant and his sisters have lived very 
separate lives for three decades or more. Applicant's sisters left home before Applicant was a teenager, and they have never returned but for the 
aforementioned visits. All of the foregoing leads me to conclude that they are not as close as would otherwise be presumed in a sibling relationship.</P> 
 
<P>Further, available information supports application of MC 1.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN> Despite its disjunctive wording, to apply MC 1 it must be shown Applicant's Israeli relatives are 
not agents of a foreign power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> are not vulnerable to exploitation by the Israeli government so that Applicant would have to choose between their well 
being and the interests of the United States.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  As to the first prong of MC 1, none of Applicant's relatives works for the Israeli government or is an agent 
thereof. The only official connection any of them has had is through their military obligations, but all have completed their service. Applicant thinks one or 
more of his sisters' children may still be subject to recall by the military, but available information on this point is inconclusive and somewhat speculative. As to 
the second prong involving potential for coercion, available information shows that Israel is an open society, governed through a democratically-elected 
legislature and executive, checked by an independent judiciary. There are no known problems regarding human rights abuses by Israel, and the U.S. and Israel 
enjoy close, mutually supportive relations. I am mindful of the information showing <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Israel is active in military and industrial espionage. Nonetheless, I conclude 
that there is little likelihood Israel, a nation generally friendly toward the United States, will try to leverage Applicant's relationship with his sisters or his other 
Israeli relatives to gain access to the information with which Applicant works. Based on the foregoing, I conclude SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c for the Applicant, 
and further conclude he has mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person.</STRONG> In evaluating Applicant's case, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors collectively referred to as the "whole person" concept.<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN> 
For the same reasons that Guideline B MC 1 applies, I conclude in this context that there is little likelihood of coercion by the Israeli government because, in 
addition to the adjudicative factors already discussed,<A HREF="06-07103.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been in the same job, and has had access without incident to the same information for 
which this determination is made since 1999. As a result, he has a well-established record of trustworthiness and reliability. Also probative is the fact that most 
of Applicant's family is rooted in the United States as five of his seven siblings, three of whom have served in the U.S. military, reside here. As a matter of 
common sense, the facts presented in this case do not pose an unacceptable risk to the interests of national security. </SPAN></P>
