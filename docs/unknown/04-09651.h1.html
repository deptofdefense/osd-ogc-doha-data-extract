<P>Applicant has a history of unresolved financial problems dating back several years.  She admitted owing approximately $24,313 in delinquent debts. In 2004 
and 2005, Applicant made repeated promises to timely resolve her debts.  At her hearing and in post-hearing submissions, she presented credible evidence to

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On June 20, 2005, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="04-09651.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="04-09651.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 26, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an 
administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me December 12, 2005.  On January 30, 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government called no witnesses and submitted five exhibits (Ex.) for 
admission to the record (Ex. 1 through 5). The Government's exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant called no witnesses and 
submitted thirteen exhibits.  At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until February 13, 2006, so Applicant could, if she wished, submit additional 
information for the record.  On February 10, 2006, Applicant requested an enlargement of time to supply additional materials for the record.  Department 
Counsel did not object to Applicant's request; accordingly, I granted Applicant an extension until February 21, 2006.  On February 21, 2006, Applicant filed ten 
additional exhibits.  Department Counsel did not object to the proposed exhibits, which were marked as Applicant's Ex. N through W and entered in the record 
of this proceeding.  On February 8, 2006, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains twelve allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all 
twelve allegations.  Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 46 years old and employed as a waiver assistant by a government contractor.  (Ex. 1.)  Applicant has been married twice.  She was married for the 
first time in 1978.  The marriage ended in divorce in 1989.  In 2000, Applicant married her present husband.  Applicant is the mother of a son, born in 1985 
during her first marriage.  (Ex. 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been steadily employed since 1994.  She has worked for her present employer since December 2002.  (Ex. 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies.  The SOR alleges, and Applicant admits,  four past due debts, three bad debts, four accounts in collection 
status, and an unpaid judgment.    These debts total approximately $24,313.  Five of Applicant's delinquencies occurred in 1997, 1998, and 1999.  One account, 
in the amount of approximately $7,654, was placed for collection in November 2000.  Another account, in the amount of approximately $4,819, was placed for 
collection in November 2002.  In April 2003, a judgment was entered against Applicant for $709.  (SOR.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After her divorce from her first husband in 1989, Applicant moved from the family home and purchased a condominium.  (Tr. 81-82.)   Her former husband 
was responsible for child support. She intended to live in the condominium with her son.  When the son was 12 years old, the former husband took the son to 
live outside the U.S.  Applicant's former husband then sued her for child support.  Applicant did not earn enough money to pay child support and to meet her 
obligations to pay for an automobile and the condominium.  She began to fall behind in her financial obligations.  Her automobile was repossessed and she lost 
the condominium.  (Tr. 55; 81-83.)  Applicant's salary was garnished to pay child support.  (Ex. E, F, V.)  Two of the debts alleged in the SOR are for personal 
loans Applicant acquired to help pay her debts.  <EM>(See</EM> SOR 1. b. and 1.g.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant married her second husband, she was hopeful that she would be able to overcome her financial problems.  However, the husband's mother 
became ill and the husband lost his job because he was caring for his mother.  (Tr. 83-84.)  Applicant's husband is now gainfully employed.  He pays the 
mortgage on the marital home.  (Tr. 78.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 2004, Applicant signed an agreement authorizing a credit counseling company to negotiate settlement agreements with her creditors. (Ex. 3.)  
Applicant stated: "I know I'm on the right track now to pay off all my debts and sought financial counseling.  I'm taking full charge and responsibility to pay 
my debts to stay debt free.  I need this clearance to stay employed."  (Ex. 3 at 6.)  She further stated that the debts alleged at subparagraphs 1.e., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 
and 1.l. of the SOR would be paid off in November and  December 2004.  (Ex. 3 at 5.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2006, on the weekend before her hearing, Applicant contacted an on-line credit counseling  company to arrange a consolidation loan to pay some of 
her creditors.  The  plan provided for the first consolidated payment to be made in February 2006.  Applicant offered this unsigned agreement as evidence of her 
plan to systematically pay her financial delinquencies.  (Ex. A; Tr. 44; 70-72.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her response to the SOR, Applicant stated the debt alleged at subparagraph 1.e. had  been paid in full.  At her hearing she submitted a document indicating 
the debt had been paid March 10, 2005.  (Ex. H.)  Also in her response to the SOR, Applicant stated the debt alleged at subparagraph 1.k. was paid in full in 
August 2005.  She failed to provide credible evidence that the debt had been paid.  (Ex. I; Ex. N; Ex. Q; Ex. R.)  Applicant also stated debts alleged at 
subparagraphs 1.i., 1.j. and 1.l. of the SOR would be paid in full in September 2005.  Applicant's post-hearing submissions indicated that the debt alleged at 
subparagraph 1.i. was paid February 2, 2006 (Ex. O); the debt alleged at subparagraph 1.j. was paid February 21, 2006  (Ex. S); and the debt alleged at 
subparagraph 1.l. was paid in full February 17, 2006, by Applicant's husband.  (Ex. U.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to provide credible evidence to demonstrate the debts alleged at subparagraphs 1.c. and 1.f. of the SOR were one and the same debt.  (Ex. A; 
Ex. W.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted letters from her supervisor and program manager attesting to her conscientiousness and dependability.  (Ex. B and Ex. C.)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay 
their just debts may try to generate funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, and she has not 
demonstrated a willingness to satisfy her debts.  These conditions raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged that Applicant was indebted to a creditor for approximately $1,178 for an account charged off as a bad debt in about September 
1997, and, as of November 9, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.a.); that she was indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of $3,128 for an 
account placed for collection in about December 1997, and, as of November 9, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.b.); that she was indebted to a creditor 
in the approximate amount of $5,660 for an account charged off as a bad debt in about April 1998, and, as of November 9, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied 
(&para; 1.c.); that she was indebted to a creditor in the approximate amount of  $733 for an account charged off as a bad debt in about May 1999, and, as of March 
30, 2005, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.d.); that she was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $113 on an account placed for collection in about 
November 1999, and, as of March 30, 2005, the debt had not been satisfied. (&para; 1.e.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA also alleged  that Applicant was indebted to a creditor for approximately $7,654 on an account placed for collection in about November 2000, and, as of 
arch 30, 2005, the account had not been satisfied (&para; 1.f.); that she was indebted to a creditor for approximately $4,819 on an account placed for collection in 
November 2002, and, as of March 30, 2005, the account had not been satisfied (&para; 1.g.); that she was indebted to a creditor for approximately $709 for a 
judgment entered against her in about April 2003, and, as of March 30, 2005, the judgment had not been satisfied (&para; 1.h.); that she owed a creditor 
approximately $114.63 on a past due debt, and, as of November 9, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.i.); that she owed approximately $25 on a past due 
medical account,  and as of November 9, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.j.); that she owed a creditor approximately $22.55 on a past due account, 
and, as of November 9, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.k.); and that she owed a dentist approximately $157 on a past due account,  and, as of 
November 9, 2004, the debt had not been satisfied (&para; 1.l.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established, through Applicant's admissions and the record evidence, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  
Applicant provided no persuasive evidence to rebut eleven of the twelve the financial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions 
under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.<A HREF="04-09651.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  However, Applicant provided persuasive evidence that she had paid the debt alleged at subparagraph 
1.e. before the March 30, 2005, date cited in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to a review of the several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant's delinquencies 
date to at least 1997.  Applicant's financial delinquencies involve long-standing debts, some of which continue to be unsatisfied to this day.  Thus, neither 
mitigating condition E2.A.6.1.3.1. nor mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.2. applies.<A HREF="04-09651.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If a person's financial delinquencies were largely caused by conditions beyond his or her  control, mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. might apply<A HREF="04-09651.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>.  At her 
hearing, Applicant repeatedly attributed her financial delinquencies to conditions beyond her control.  Applicant cited her 1989 divorce, her subsequent 
obligation for child support, her mother-in-law's illness, and her second husband's loss of employment as conditions beyond her control which impacted her 
ability to pay her debts.  The record shows that Applicant has held steady employment since 1994.  The life circumstances cited by Applicant, while 
unfortunate, do not fully explain or mitigate her long-standing financial difficulties or her refusal to pay her debts.  Accordingly, I find that mitigating condition 
E2.A6.1.3.3. applies only in part to Applicant's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has sought counseling for her financial problems.  However, there is no indication in the evidentiary record that she has developed and implemented a 
practical plan for resolving her debts and avoiding further indebtedness.  She failed to pay debts after repeatedly asserting she would do so.  After her hearing, 
Applicant paid three debts alleged in the SOR and submitted evidence of payment on February 21, 2006.  While Applicant deserves some credit for paying her 
long over-due debts, I do not find her actions credible evidence of a good faith effort to honor her financial obligations or predictive of her ability to be 
financially responsible in the future.  Thus, mitigating conditions E2.A6.1.3.4. and E2.A6.1.3.6. do not apply.<A HREF="04-09651.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In making a determination of an applicant's security worthiness, a DOHA administrative judge must consider all the record evidence.  The presence of some 
favorable evidence about an applicant's financial conduct is not dispositive.  Rather, the judge must consider whether the favorable evidence outweighs the 
unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.   (ISCR Case No. 97-0783 at 5 (Aug. 7, 1998).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose 
further punishment for past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or 
her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security 
clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department of Defense 
Directive, 5220.6., as amended. </SPAN></P>
