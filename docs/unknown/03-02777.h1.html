<P>In the early to mid 1980's, the Applicant was convicted three times for driving while intoxicated.  He was sentenced to one to three years in the state prison for a 
November 1984 DWI.  Although his alcohol related arrests are remote in time and would otherwise be mitigated under the Criminal Conduct guideline, he is 
statutorily disqualified from having a clearance granted or renewed under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. In August 2002, the Applicant completed an SF 86 and lied about 
his alcohol arrests. He has failed to mitigate the Personal Conduct concerns. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 29, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In an undated 
response the Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 13, 2004, the Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) dated April 5, 2004, and was given the opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation. The Applicant's response to the FORM was due on May 13, 2004. No response has 
been received. In the FORM, Department Counsel submitted 9 exhibits (Items). I was assigned the case on May 20, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Criminal Conduct (Guideline J), and Personal Conduct (Guideline E).  The Applicant admits he was arrested, charged, and pleaded guilty to 
driving a motor vehicle while intoxicated (DWI) in January 1981. That admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 62-years-old, has worked as an engineering technician for a defense contractor since June 2002, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 1981, he was arrested and charged with DWI. After pleading guilty, he paid a $100.00 fine. The FBI report (Item 8) lists entries for October 1983 
and March 1984, both for DWI.  Both these incidents were reported by the same agency and have the same case number. It is uncertain if this represents one or 
two arrests.  In November 1984, he was again charged with DWI.  He was sentenced to one to three years in the state prison for the offense and was 
incarcerated one year. The remainder of his sentence was served through work release and parol. While in prison, he received alcohol counseling and outpatient 
treatment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's drinking was contributed to by his pending divorce and the failure of his business.  He used alcohol as a way of escaping his hard times. (Item 
7) He last consumed alcohol prior to his incarceration.  He has no intention of ever using alcohol again. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 2002, the Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application, SF 86.  Question 24a. (Item 6) asked him if he had ever been charged with or 
convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs? He answered "No" to the question because he believed his current employer would never have given him 
an interview or hired him, if they knew of his arrests. (Item 7) He feels awful about this.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct (Guideline J)</STRONG> The Concern:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   b.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  d.  The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense or the 
Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct (Guideline E)</STRONG>  The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when an applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity which creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Between May 1981 and November 1984, the Applicant was arrested three<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> times for drunk driving. Disqualifying Condition (DC) b.<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's most recent arrest occurred almost 20 years ago. Mitigating Condition (MC) a.<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies to mitigate the Applicant's now dated criminal conduct 
because the conduct is not recent. His divorce and failed marriage contributed to his drinking. These factors are unlikely to recur.  MC d.<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies.  The standard 
required in MC f. is "clear evidence" of rehabilitation.  Here the record only shows "some evidence" of rehabilitation, i.e., 19 plus years of sobriety and his 
unsupported statement that he has been a model citizen. Therefore, MC f.<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> does not apply.  However, applying MC a. and d. are sufficient to find for the 
Applicant as to his alcohol related arrests.  I find for him as to SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b. , 1.c., and 1.d. as the alcohol-related criminal conduct is not likely 
to recur.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was sentenced to one to three years confinement.  DC c.<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies.  Unless the Applicant is able to obtain a waiver from the Secretary of Defense, 
10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 prohibits the Department of Defense from granting the Applicant a clearance. I find against the Applicant as to subparagraph 1.e. of the SOR.  
Furthermore, I am not making a recommendation concerning a waiver of Title 10 U.S.C. 986 because the decision denying or revoking a clearance is not being 
made solely as a result of 10 U.S.C. 986. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Personal Conduct, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct 
which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. In August 2002, the Applicant completed an SF 86 and lied when he answered 
the question concerning his alcohol related arrests.  He did so because he did not think his present employer would have interviewed him or hired him had his 
alcohol related arrests been known. DC 2<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The falsification was deliberate and none of the mitigating conditions apply.  MC 2<A HREF="03-02777.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> does not apply because, even though the falsification was on a single form, 
the falsification occurred in August 2002 so it is recent.  MC 3 does not apply because there is no evidence the Applicant made a prompt, good -faith effort to 
correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  MC 4. does not apply because there has been no showing of improper or inadequate advice. I 
find against the Applicant as to Personal Conduct, SOR subparagraph 2.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
