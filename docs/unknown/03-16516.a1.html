  The Board reviews decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges. Hearing Office Judges do not review Board decisions.  The August 16, 2000 DoD memorandum concerning foreign passports is legally binding on a Judge regardless of what the Judge might think about its wisdom,  desirability, or efficacy.  The Board cannot and does not presume to review or pass judgment on the policy decisions of DoD officials.  With one  exception, Department Counsel persuasively argues the Judge's application of Adjudicative Guidelines provisions was arbitrary and capricious.   Department Counsel failed to show the Judge erred in his application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5 in this case.  The Judge failed to  articulate a sustainable basis for his conclusion that Applicant had mitigated his possession and use of an Iranian passport and his ties to siblings in Iran.   Favorable decision reversed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 4, 2003, which stated the 
reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales issued a favorable security clearance decision, dated 
June 10, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law 
by not applying an August 16, 2000 Department of Defense memorandum concerning foreign passports to Applicant's case; and (2) whether  the 
Administrative Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law when he applied certain provisions of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines.  For the reasons that follow, the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether 
there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify 
how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 
00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or 
(2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary 
or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it 
reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the 
record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) 
at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether 
they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not 
required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are 
supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the 
same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, 
but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect 
a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party 
challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 
4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law by not applying an August 16, 2000 Department 
of Defense memorandum concerning foreign passports to Applicant's case</SPAN>.   The Administrative Judge found that Applicant possessed and used an 
Iranian passport after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1991 and that Applicant did not surrender that Iranian passport.  However, 
taking issue with a Board decision interpreting the August 16, 2000 memorandum concerning foreign passports,<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P> and invoking the "overall common 
sense determination" language from Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E.2.2.3, the Judge concluded that the facts and circumstances of 
Applicant's case did not fall under the scope of the August 16, 2000 memorandum.  Department Counsel challenges the Judge's analysis and ruling on 
this aspect of the case as being arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because it runs contrary to a Board decision on point and is inconsistent with 
the language and meaning of the August 16, 2000 memorandum concerning foreign passports.</P> 
 
<P>The Board reviews decisions by Hearing Office Administrative Judges.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  Neither the 
Directive nor well-established principles of federal administrative law provide for a Hearing Office Judge to review Board decisions.  While a Hearing 
Office Judge may disagree with a Board decision, a Hearing Office Judge has no more authority or discretion to "sidestep" or "overrule" a Board 
decision that runs contrary to the Judge's preferences than an applicant or Department Counsel has to "sidestep" or "overrule" a ruling of the Judge 
during the course of the proceedings before the Judge.  The Judge's attempt to "sidestep" or "overrule" a  Board decision is arbitrary, capricious, and 
contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Furthermore, the Administrative Judge's expressed disagreement with a Board decision is, for all practical purposes, a disagreement with the language 
and scope of the August 16, 2000 memorandum concerning foreign passports that was discussed in that Board decision.  The August 16, 2000 
memorandum is legally binding on the Judge, regardless of what the Judge might think about its wisdom, desirability, or efficacy.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P>  A Judge's authority 
under the Directive does not extend to reviewing or passing judgment on the wisdom, desirability, or efficacy of DoD policy.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's invocation of the "overall common sense determination" language from the Directive is misplaced.  The  language of 
Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines, Item E2.2.3 concerning an adjudicator's obligation to make a "common sense determination" does not trump or 
nullify the authority of DoD to make and set policy for security clearance adjudications.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Both Hearing Office Judges and the Board must render fair 
and impartial decisions that are consistent with applicable law and DoD policy.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P>  The "overall common sense determination" language cited by the 
Judge does not authorize the Judge to decide whether to apply the provisions of the August 16, 2000 memorandum in cases involving foreign 
passports.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Furthermore, acceptance of the Judge's reasoning in this case would result in the untenable situation that a Hearing Office Judge could cite 
the "overall common sense determination" language of the Directive to avoid or circumvent any specific provision of the Directive, or applicable DoD 
policy, that the Judge felt did not comport with the Judge's concept of what was wise, desirable, or efficacious.</P> 
 
<P>Accordingly, the Board concludes Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Administrative Judge's analysis and ruling concerning Applicant's 
Iranian passport are arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law when he applied certain provisions of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that: (a) Applicant's possession and use of an Iranian passport and voting in an Iranian 
election -- both after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen -- were mitigated under Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P>; (b) Applicant's family 
ties with two siblings in Iran were mitigated under Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P>; and (c) Applicant was entitled to the application of 
Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
<P>  Department Counsel challenges the Judge's application of those three Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating 
conditions as being arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Department Counsel's arguments in support of this claim of error have some merit.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly asserts that the August 16, 2000 memorandum concerning foreign passports applies to Applicant's case.  Given the 
applicability of the August 16, 2000 memorandum concerning foreign passports, it was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law for the Administrative 
Judge to apply Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1 to Applicant's possession and use of an Iranian passport.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> 
<P>  The legal effect of the August 
16, 2000 memorandum cannot be avoided or circumvented by the invocation of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>It is not clear from the decision below whether the Administrative Judge applied Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1 to Applicant's conduct in 
voting in an Iranian election in 2001, after he had become a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Nor is it clear from the decision below as to what weight the 
Judge gave to Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1.  However, Department Counsel correctly notes that the applicability of Foreign Preference 
itigating Condition 1 in a given case does not relieve a Judge from the need to consider record evidence that shows an applicant has exercised the 
rights and privileges of foreign citizenship after the applicant becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
<P>  In this case, Applicant exercised the rights and 
privileges of Iranian citizenship -- by possessing and using an Iranian passport and voting in an Iranian election -- after he became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> 
<P>  The Judge's decision does not articulate any discernable analysis or reasoning as to how or why Applicant's exercise of the rights and 
privileges of Iranian citizenship after acquiring U.S. citizenship was mitigated by the application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
<P>  
Accordingly, the Judge's application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1 is not sustainable.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
<P>Department Counsel makes several arguments in support of its challenge to the Administrative Judge's application of Foreign Influence Mitigating 
Condition 1: (a) the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Iran did not pose a serious security risk in this case because there was no evidence that 
the Iranian government has sought to apply pressure, directly or indirectly on Applicant in the past; (b) the Judge erred by focusing solely on the 
possibility that the Iranian government might try to exert coercive pressure on Applicant, without considering the possibility that the Iranian government 
might try to exert noncoercive influence on Applicant; (c) the Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for his conclusion that Applicant's desire to 
protect his wife and child in the United States would make him unwilling to cooperate with the Iranian government if his siblings in Iran were threatened; 
and (d) there is no record evidence to support the Judge's statement that he is confident that Applicant understands that he must restrain his wife and 
child from traveling to Iran in order to diminish his vulnerability to possible pressure from the Iranian government.  For the reasons that follow, some of 
those arguments have merit.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Department Counsel is not required to prove that a foreign country has specifically targeted a particular 
applicant with immediate family members living in that foreign country.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Facts and circumstances that raise security concerns about an applicant's 
security eligibility can warrant an adverse security clearance decision without any proof that a foreign intelligence or security service has specifically 
targeted the applicant or sought to exploit those facts and circumstances.  For example, falsification (Guideline E), a history of financial difficulties 
(Guideline F), alcohol abuse (Guideline G), or substance abuse (Guideline H) can warrant adverse security clearance decisions without any evidence 
that a foreign intelligence or security service has targeted the particular applicant with such problems or sought to exploit the particular applicant's 
situation.  There is no good reason to require such proof in a Guideline B (Foreign Influence) case.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Applicant's vulnerability to possible foreign 
influence through his siblings in Iran is the same whether or not the Iranian government has sought to exert such influence or pressure in the past.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  The 
Judge's conclusion that the Iranian government is not likely to target Applicant in the future has no basis in the record evidence in this case.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel persuasively argues that there is no record evidence that supports the Administrative Judge's stated confidence that Applicant 
understands that he must restrain his wife and child from traveling to Iran in order to diminish his vulnerability to possible pressure from the Iranian 
government.  Absent such record evidence, the Judge's statement provides no legally sustainable basis for his favorable conclusions under Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence).  Given the record evidence in this case and the Judge's own findings of fact, the Judge's statement  has the practical effect of 
resolving an acknowledged doubt about Applicant's security eligibility in favor of Applicant.  Such action is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to 
law.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that security concerns can be raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) by facts and circumstances indicating 
an applicant is vulnerable to coercive or noncoercive influence or pressure.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> 
<P>  However, Department Counsel does not articulate a persuasive 
argument that shows the Judge's decision commits that error.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's claim of error concerning Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5 is not persuasive.  The applicability of Adjudicative 
Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating conditions is not solely dependent on the specific wording of SOR allegations.  Rather, the applicability of 
Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating conditions turns largely on whether there is record evidence that would support their application.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> 
<P>  
Furthermore, given the record evidence in this case, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Judge to note and take into account the 
record evidence showing that Applicant does not have financial interests in Iran.  Finally, Department Counsel's reliance on the Board's decision in 
ISCR Case No. 98-0507 (May 17, 1999) is not persuasive in demonstrating the Judge erred by applying Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5.  
Although that Board decision contains a discussion of Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 5 which is on point, it is factually distinguishable from this 
case.  The Board does not read the Judge's decision in this case as committing the same kind of reasoning error that occurred in ISCR Case No. 98-0507.</P> 
 
<P>In response to Department Counsel's appeal brief, Applicant cites to language in the Administrative Judge's decision to support his position that the 
Judge's decision is supported by the record evidence and is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant's argument is not persuasive.  
Under the Directive, the Board reviews Hearing Office Judge decisions.<A HREF="03-16516.a1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> 
<P>  If the Board were bound to follow and accept a Judge's findings, 
conclusions, or rulings, then no appealing party -- either applicant or Department Counsel -- would have any meaningful appeal.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel has demonstrated error below that warrants reversal.  Pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.33.3, the 
Board reverses the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_17_">17. </A> A person who is in a position of being vulnerable to blackmail or pressure is not less vulnerable to being blackmailed or pressured merely because 
the person has not been subjected to a previous attempt at blackmail or pressure.  The person's vulnerability is no less a vulnerability merely because 
the person has been fortunate enough to have no one - to date - try to exploit that vulnerability.  Similarly, a person who is in a conflict of interest 
situation is no less in an conflict of interest situation merely because there is no evidence to date that anyone has specifically sought to exploit the 
situation.  The risks associated with vulnerability to blackmail or pressure, or a conflict of interest situation, are not reduced, diminished, or rendered 
acceptable merely because there is no evidence that anyone has sought to exploit those risks, to date.
