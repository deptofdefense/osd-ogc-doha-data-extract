<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant.  On 12 September 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR)<A HREF="02-25003.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial
Considerations) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR
in writing on 26 November 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The
case was assigned to me on 5 March 2004.  On 16 March 2004, I convened a hearing to consider
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.<A HREF="02-25003.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 25 March 2004.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is a 33-year-old electronics technician for a defense contractor.  In 1990, at the age
of 19, she married.  She and her first husband had three children, now ages 13, 11, and 9.  She
separated from her husband in November 1998 and divorced him in June 2000.  She married again
in March 2002.  Tr. 24-25; Ex. 1 at 1, 2, 5-6.  Her second husband incurred an $8,000 debt as a result
of emergency medical treatment and has not had steady employment.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's financial difficulties began in 1996 when she and her first husband started to
experience marital problems and they separated temporarily on more than one occasion.  Tr. 51. 
Before the final separation, Applicant did not work outside the home.  After the separation,
Applicant's husband paid for rent for Applicant and the children, but apparently did not pay child
support.  Applicant fell behind in her bills and wrote many worthless checks.  Even after her
checking account was closed, Applicant continued, from July 2000 to June 2001, to write checks on
it.  Answer, attachments.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant has paid many of these delinquent debts.  However, in December 2003 and
February 2004, her monthly income was not sufficient to meet her expenditures.  In January 2004,
it took a $3,900 income tax refund for her to cover her expenses.  In March 2004, her projected
expenditures exceed her net income (including the court-ordered child support that had not as yet
been paid) by almost $2,000.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Between April 1997 and June 2001, Applicant was arrested, had warrants issued for her
arrest, or had misdemeanor complaints issued on at least seven occasions.  Applicant has resolved
all of these checks offenses through the court system.  </P>

518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at
527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States,
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well
as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec.
Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. 
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating
the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative
process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865
&sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and
the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal
or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a
nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed
in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.
May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the
burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden
of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had 50 delinquent debts, several of which were
incurred when she wrote checks with insufficient funds in her account to pay them.  An applicant
who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the
50 delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial
obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and has been unable or unwilling to satisfy these debts (DC
E2.A6.1.2.3.).  One of the most disturbing aspects of this case is that Applicant wrote at least 12
checks between July 2000 and June 2001 on an account that had been closed.  Answer.  This
amounts to check fraud.  DC E2.A6.1.2.2.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Many of these debts were caused by circumstances beyond Applicant's control (MC
E2.A6.1.3.3.)-her divorce, the failure of her ex-husband to make his child support payments, and
the unexpected medical expenses incurred by her second husband.  In March 2002, she claimed she
would have all her debts paid by June 2002.  Ex. 2 at 7.  Applicant established she paid many of
these debts, including the fraudulent checks, and established payment plans for some of the others. 
This is some evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve her financial problems.  MC E2.A6.1.3.6. 
But even in months in which Applicant's ex-husband pays the child support, Applicant's expenses
exceed her income unless her husband is working.  Applicant will not be able to extricate herself
from her financial difficulties until her husband gets steady employment.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After carefully reviewing in toto the evidence, as well as the applicable disqualifying and
mitigating conditions, and without viewing each debt in isolation, I find against Applicant on all
subparagraphs, except &para;&para; 1.cc. and 1.ww.-Applicant is contesting both of these debts.  Applicant
failed to demonstrate she has resolved her financial problems.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested for, and convicted of, theft (&para; 2.a.) and
warrants or complaints were issued against her because she issued worthless checks (&para;&para; 2.b.-2.f.). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">

criminal offenses alleged in SOR &para; 2.  These multiple lesser offenses are a disqualifying condition
under Guideline J.  DC E2.A10.1.2.2.  The only listed mitigating condition that might apply is the
criminal behavior was not recent.  MC E2.A10.1.3.1.  However, in light of Applicant's continued
financial problems and the relatively short period of time between her past criminal conduct and the
hearing, I am unwilling to apply it.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
