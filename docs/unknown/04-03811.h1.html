<P>Applicant was convicted of conversion of government property in 1998, sentenced to five years supervised probation, and ordered to pay restitution to the 
United States in the amount of $11,927.27. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 31, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on 
ay 9, 2005, admitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. </P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on August 26, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on September 9, 2005, scheduling the hearing for September 29, 2005. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted ten documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-10, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified but did not provide any other evidence. The transcript was received on October 17, 2005.     </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 44 years old, has never been married, and has no children. He earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1984, and a master of arts degree in 1996. He 
possessed a secret security clearance form about 1986 to 1989, and a top secret security clearance with access to sensitive compartmentalized information (SCI) 
from 1993 to 1998. Applicant has been employed as a systems engineer by a defense contractor since March 2003. He was unemployed from July 2002 to 
arch 2003, and was employed as a senior structural designer from October 2000 to July 2002.  </P> 
<P>Applicant was charged with Reckless Driving in May 1990, pled nolo contendere to the charge, adjudication was withheld, and he was fined $244.00. He was 
charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and Reckless Driving in November 1998. He pled guilty to a reduced charge of Driving While Ability 
Impaired, the DUI and Reckless Driving Charges were dismissed, and he was placed on probation for 12 months, and ordered to attend an alcohol evaluation 
program, perform 24 hours community service, and pay a fine and court costs totaling $349.00.</P> 
<P>Applicant was employed by the government as a Visual Information Specialist and then as the Visual Information Manager from 1992 to 1998. Between August 
1995 and January 1996, Applicant signed for about $70,000.00 worth of computer and computer related equipment that had been purchased by and for the use 
of the U.S. Air Force. Applicant was directed to conduct an inventory sometime between February and April 1997, and he reported the equipment was in a 
storage facility at another location. Several months later, Applicant was questioned about the equipment when others could not locate it where he stated it had 
been, and he maintained his claim that it had been at the site where he had indicated it was when he conducted the inventory.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant was informed he would have to account for the missing equipment, and approximately a week later much of the missing equipment was returned. 
However, about eight to ten items remained missing. Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation who were assigned to investigate the missing 
equipment received information that Applicant had been using government equipment in a private business he was operating, and that equipment similar to the 
missing equipment had been observed in Applicant's apartment. The agents obtained an inventory of the equipment that had not been returned, which was 
valued at about $28,000.00, and executed a search warrant for Applicant's apartment on February 10, 1998.</P> 
<P>The agents recovered two Sony Computer monitors, two Apple Power CPUs, and a Sledge Hammer hard drive during the search that were part of the missing 
government property. Two Apple keyboards that were identified as U.S. Air Force property but not included in the list of missing property were also recovered 
during the search. Applicant was questioned about the recovered property, and acknowledged his possession of the property constituted "misuse of government 
property." However, Applicant claimed he neither intended to sell nor profit from the misuse of the property, and that he intended to return it at some indefinite 
time, "probably when he ended his employment with the U.S. Government."</P> 
<P>Applicant resigned his employment in about April 1998, his security clearance was thereafter terminated, and he pled guilty to a felony of converting 
government property having a value of more than $10,000.00 but less than $20,000.00 on May 4, 1998. On July 20, 1998, he was sentenced to  five years 
probation, placed on home detention for four months, and, as community service, he was required to speak to his former co-workers about conversion of 
government property. He was also ordered to make restitution to the United States in the amount of $11,927.27. Applicant, having complied with all terms of 
probation, was discharged from probation on September 18, 2002, and the proceedings in his case were terminated.</P> 
<P>Applicant provided a statement to a Special Agent (SA) from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on January 22, 2004, in which he greatly minimized his 
culpability for the criminal activity that led to his 1998 conviction. Essentially, Applicant's statement is to the effect that he decided to store the equipment at 
his private business and in his home without filling out the proper paperwork because it seemed to him at the time there was not a more suitable government 
facility to use for storage. He only admits to having used the equipment to train government employees at his private company's facilities at no cost to the 
government.   </P> 
<P>Applicant's hearing testimony was similar to the statement he provided the DSS SA in January 2004. However, at the hearing he did admit to using the 
equipment to some limited extent for his personal use. He attributes his use of the equipment for personal use to poor judgment.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J. Applicant was convicted of a relatively minor traffic offense in 1990, a much 
more serious alcohol related traffic offense in 1998, and a felony offense against the U.S. government in 1998. His offense against the U.S. government 
occurred while he possessed a top secret security clearance and was entrusted with SCI access. DC 2: <EM>A single serious crime</EM> <EM>or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply. </P> 
<P>Applicant's statement to the DSS SA and his hearing testimony, in which he greatly minimizes any wrongdoing on his part, are not credible. The only evidence 
of rehabilitation that he presented were his successful completion of probation, the passage of time, and his self-serving statements about working hard, 
attaining financial stability, regaining his personal integrity, and become a responsible citizen. While those things certainly must be considered and given some 
weight, they are insufficient to establish that Applicant has now become a trustworthy individual when they are compared with the tremendous breach of trust 
he committed less than eight years ago.</P> 
<P>Weighing Applicant's criminal transgressions against what record evidence there is demonstrating for and against rehabilitation, I find Mitigating Conditions 
(MC) 4: <EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>;<EM> </EM>and MC 6: <EM>There is clear evidence of 
successful rehabilitation</EM> do not apply. Further, although Applicant's last criminal offense occurred seven years ago, his false testimony and statement to a DSS 
SA seriously minimizes any credit he might otherwise receive from MC 1: <EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>. The remaining mitigating conditions clearly 
have no applicability to the facts of this case.<EM> </EM>   </P> 
<P>In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Once again, it must be noted that no one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> 
and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-03811.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> After considering the 
evidence of record in this case, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his criminal conduct. Guideline J is decided against 
Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>
