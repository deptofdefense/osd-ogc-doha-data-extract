<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 48-year-old engineer has alcohol-related arrests in 1987, 1993, and 2001.  He deliberately did not tell the complete truth on his 2002 security clearance application and in a 2003 sworn 
statement given to a DoD agent.  Each falsification was intentional and constitutes a violation of 10 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.  Mitigation has not been shown.  Clearance is denied. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2005, Applicant submitted a Response to the allegations set forth in the SOR (RSOR), and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge based on the written 
record; i.e., without a hearing.  A File of relevant Materials (FORM) was issued on November 23, 2005. Applicant was notified that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days 
of receipt.  The response was due by January 4, 2006, but no response has been submitted.  The matter was referred to me for decision on January 25, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old engineer for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains three allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct); and one allegation under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) 
(Item 1).  In his response, Applicant admits Guideline E allegations 1.a.(1) and 1.a.(2), and denies 1.b and 2.a.  The factual admissions are accepted and incorporated as Findings of Fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the totality of the evidence of record, I make the following Findings of Fact as to each SOR allegation:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Guideline E (Personal Conduct) </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As cited in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. - Applicant falsified material facts on his security clearance application (SF 86) of October 31, 2002 when in response to Question <STRONG>24 Your Police Record-Alcohol/Drug Offenses, </STRONG>[Have you 
ever been charged or convicted], Applicant stated "Yes" and listed an April 2001 Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) charge, and deliberately omitted any mention of </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.(1) an arrest in January 1993 for DWI- 1st Offense; and </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.(2) an arrest in September 1987 for DWI while serving in the U.S. Army. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. - In a signed sworn statement, made on September 30, 2001 to an investigator of the Department of Defense, Applicant stated that he had been arrested for DWI in January 1993 and April 2001, 
but deliberately omitted any mention of the 1987 DWI arrest cited in 1.a.(2), above.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. - The falsifications alleged in SOR 1.a.(1) and 1.a.(2) constitute violations of 10 U.S.C. 1001, a felony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the 
presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood 
of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether 
it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of 
having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those 
controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security 
concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 40-year-old (born in 1965) employee of a defense contractor.  Applicant's explanations appear in his Sworn Statement (Item 6) and his Response to the SOR (RSOR) (Item  2).  Based 
on all of the information in the record, I conclude the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Guideline E </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his sworn statement (Item 6), Applicant states that he did not list all of his alcohol-related arrests because he was  afraid he might not get a security clearance if he admitted he had two DWI 
arrests. <EM> </EM>In his answer to the SOR (Item 2), he admitted that shortly after the interview that resulted in the sworn statement, in which he claimed the falsification was due to negligence, that he 
remembered the 1987 arrest while in the military.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted that he should have gone back to the agent and corrected the falsification, but he did not do so.  I conclude that Applicant had three alcohol-related arrests, in 1987, 1993, and 
2001; he remembered all three arrests, and he deliberately failed to tell the truth, with the specific intention of deceiving DoD, and of obtaining a security clearance he did not think he would receive 
if he told the truth.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Conditions </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P>

Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative 
in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P>

The falsification was not an isolated incident, was recent, and the individual did not subsequently provided correct 
information voluntarily; and (3)  The individual did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">GUIDELINE J</EM> (Criminal Conduct) - The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Overall, I conclude that the Government has provided evidence supporting all SOR allegations, but Applicant has not provided substantive evidence in mitigation.  Consequently, the evidence 
compels the conclusion that Applicant does not currently possess the judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets.  </SPAN></P>
