<P>The Applicant has a long history of not paying his just debts.  He currently owes approximately $19,000 to nine creditors.  He has payment arrangements with 
two of the creditors, but submitted no evidence that he has reached similar arrangements with the other seven, or that he has a plan to pay off these creditors.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 6, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 10, 2003, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN>The Government submitted its 
File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on May 15, 2003.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any documents in 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on May 20, 2003.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He submitted no additional documentation.  The case was assigned to 
the undersigned on June 27, 2003.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 30 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Member of the Technical Staff, and he seeks to obtain or retain a DoD security 
clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has 
financial difficulties which may indicate poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability on his part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has had financial problems for some time.  He admits in his sworn statement of September 2001 that the problems began in 1995.   He was 
involved in a traffic accident in 1997, which affected his ability to pay on his debts.  The Applicant and his wife contemplated filing bankruptcy in 1998 and 
2002.  However, they have not done so.  He was medically discharged from the US Navy in February 1999.  He was unemployed or underemployed from 
February 1999 to July 2000, when he began working at his present employer.  In his sworn statement of September 2001, he says, "We are currently paying our 
financial obligations timely, although, with a few exceptions, we are not making payments on our previous delinquent accounts.  At the present time, I can not 
commit to any payments on our prior delinquent accounts as we don't have any additional funds available."  (Government Exhibit 5 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits owing a past due debt to the Army and Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES).  In October 2002 the Applicant entered 
into a payment arrangement with AAFES to pay his $1,886 debt at the rate of $78 a month for 24 months.  (Government Exhibit 11.)  The Applicant states in 
his Answer to the SOR, "I began repaying this debt October 2002."  However, he submitted no evidence to show that he has been paying this debt in a 
consistent and timely manner.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant denies in his Answer owing approximately $1,619 to this creditor.  However, in his sworn statement he states, "[Creditor 
1.b.] was a credit purchase at 'Good Guys Department Store'."  The creditor identified in Subparagraph 1.k. as "The Good Buys" appears to be a typographical 
error, substituting "B" for "G."  Therefore, it is a duplicate of this debt.  This creditor is also found in several credit reports provided by the Government 
(Government Exhibits 6, 7, 8 and 9).  In addition, the creditor is found in a credit report evidently provided by the Applicant (Government Exhibit 10).  I find 
that the Applicant does owe this debt.  No evidence was submitted showing that the Applicant has paid, or otherwise resolved, this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits owing this credit card debt in the amount of $2,763.  No evidence was submitted showing that the Applicant has paid, 
or otherwise resolved, this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of $2,092.  No evidence was submitted showing that the Applicant has paid, or 
otherwise resolved, this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant denies in his Answer owing this cable television bill in the amount of $33.  In his sworn statement the Applicant states, "This 
is the cable television bill for my previous address.  I will agree with the cable bill as this would represent the last month of cable service.  I will pay this 
amount."  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2-3.)  I find that the Applicant does owe this debt.  No evidence was submitted showing that the Applicant has paid, or 
otherwise resolved, this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant denies this credit card debt in the amount of $2,092 and alleges it is the same debt as 1.d.  The amounts in these accounts are 
the same, a fact brought out by the Applicant in his sworn statement.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 3.)  In addition, only one credit report shows two accounts, 
again with the same amounts.  (Government Exhibit 9 at 6.)  The other credit reports show only one account.  The Applicant's argument is well-taken.  This 
subparagraph is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.g.  The Applicant denies owing this debt in the amount of $2,141.  In his sworn statement he says, "[Creditor 1.g.] was a credit purchase of 
household appliances.  I agree with the balance due of approximately $2,141."  I find that the Applicant does owe this debt.  No evidence was submitted 
showing that the Applicant has paid, or otherwise resolved, this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.h.  The Applicant admits owing a past due debt to the Naval Exchange Service.  In October 2002 the Applicant entered into a payment 
arrangement with the Naval Exchange Service to pay his $1,592 debt over 18 months.  (Government Exhibit 12.)  The Applicant states in his Answer to the 
SOR, "I began repaying this debt October 2002."  However, he submitted no evidence to show that he has been paying this debt in a consistent and timely 
manner, other than the first payment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.i.  The Applicant denies owing this utility bill in the amount of $144.  In his sworn statement he says, "I am not familiar with this account, 
however, I will agree with the balance due on this account."  The record also shows that the Applicant has disputed this account with the creditor and the credit 
reporting agencies.  (Government Exhibit 9 at 8.)  Given the state of the record, I cannot find that the Applicant owes this debt.  This subparagraph is found for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.j.  The Applicant admits owing a past due debt to this automobile credit corporation.  However, the record does not support the amount alleged 
of $15,828.  Rather, the amount owing is $4,925.  No evidence was submitted showing that the Applicant has paid, or otherwise resolved, this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.k.  The Applicant denies owing this debt.  This appears to be a duplicate of subparagraph 1.b.  Given the current state of the record, I cannot 
find that the Applicant owes this debt.  This subparagraph is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.l.  The Applicant denies owing this department store $1,918.  He asserts in his sworn statement that this account has been paid in full.  
(Government Exhibit 2 at 3.)  He submitted no evidence to support his allegation.  All the credit bureau reports, including that submitted by the Applicant, 
show that the account was past due and was transferred or sold.  The available evidence does not support the Applicant's assertion that the debt has been paid. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F (Financial considerations)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may have a history of indebtedness that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has a history of being unwilling or unable to pay his 
just debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.  Under Paragraph 1 (Guideline F), as set forth above, subparagraphs 1.f, 1.i. and 1.k. are found for the Applicant 
as the Government failed to show that the Applicant owed those particular debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows that the Applicant owes approximately $19,000 in past due debt to nine creditors.  He has submitted evidence showing that he made 
payment arrangements with two of the creditors, to whom he owed a joint balance of $3,478.  This leaves the Applicant owing seven creditors approximately 
$15,500 with no current or future plan to pay them off. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the Applicant's argument that his accident while in the Navy, and his subsequent employment difficulties, should vitiate his responsibility to 
repay these creditors.  However, he has been employed for over three years and did not even attempt to make any payments until October 2002.  Under the 
particular circumstances of this case, I do not find that his actions constitute a good faith effort to pay off or otherwise resolve his just debts.  It is simply too 
soon to conclude that the Applicant has properly resolved his past due debts, or that he has learned how maintain his financial stability in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. </SPAN></P>
