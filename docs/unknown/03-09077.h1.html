<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old female who works as a research assistant for a defense contractor. She took pleasure trips to Syria in 1997 and 1999, but did not list that travel on her security clearance 
application. While in Syria in 1997, she used her Syrian passport, rather than her U.S. passport, to enter and exit that country. While there, she visited her father and brother, citizens and residents of 
Syria. Applicant falsified material facts on her security clearance application when she failed to disclose that she possessed a Syrian passport. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining 
to foreign preference, foreign influence, and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On November 14, 2002, Applicant applied for a security clearance and completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On August 26, 2004, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons 
under </SPAN>Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral of the case to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 13, 2004, in a sworn, notarized statement, Applicant responded to the SOR  and requested that the case be decided on the written submissions without a hearing. Department Counsel then

Subsequently, Applicant retained legal counsel who, on January 24, 2005, requested an in-person hearing. Consequently, the case was 
assigned to me on April 27, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 20, 2005. Applicant's counsel then requested a continuance for good cause shown, which was granted. On July 21, 2005, an Amended Notice of Hearing was

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all of the allegations pertaining to foreign preference under Guideline C (subparagraph 1.a.) and foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.d.). Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the allegations pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraphs 3.a. through 3.d). After a complete and thorough  
review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old female, born in Damascus, Syria.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> She is currently employed as a research assistant for a defense contractor. She earned an associate's degree in computer science in 1991 
from a Cyprian university affiliated with a university in the U.S.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> In 1993, she immigrated to the U.S. from Cyprus.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN>She became a naturalized U.S. citizen on June 13, 1995. In December 1998, 
Applicant married a Canadian citizen living in the U.S. They have one child born in the U.S. The couple subsequently separated in November 2002.</P> 
 
<P>As a child, Applicant's parents divorced. Her mother is a citizen of Syria and a naturalized U.S. citizen, but currently resides in Cyprus with her American-born husband. She is a retired accountant for 
an offshore oil company. Her husband is a retired general manager of an offshore oil company.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father is 72 years old, and her brother<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> is 38 years old. They are both citizens and residents of Syria. Her father is retired and her brother is a jeweler. She has limited contact with them 
because her biological father did not raise her. She talks to her brother at least once or twice a year by telephone. The last time she saw either one was in 1999, when she visited Syria.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> She has not 
given her father or brother her address or telephone number in the U.S. Applicant's married sister lives in the U.S., and they maintain regular contact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has traveled extensively. She traveled to Cyprus in 1992, 1994, 1997. She visited Syria in 1997. In 1998, she visited Spain. In 1999, she went to Cyprus and Syria. Moreover, she was in 
Cyprus from May to August 2002. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's Syrian passport expired in 1998.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> In a letter dated August 2, 2005, to the Embassy of Syria, she revoked her Syrian citizenship and enclosed her expired Syrian passport, which she 
contends was torn in half.</P> 
 
<P>On November 12, 2004, she completed the Counterintelligence and Security Screening Questionnaire for Contract Linguists. Question 11 requested information about (<EM>Foreign Travel/Connections - 
Indicate if any of the following apply to you or one or more of your close relatives or associates in the <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">past 7 years</SPAN>:<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> a. Traveled outside the U.S. (except as a dependent or member of the U.S. Armed 
Forces or the U.S. government</EM>). Applicant listed travel to Spain in 1998 and to Cyprus in 1999 and 2002, but she failed to list travel to Syria in 1997 and 1999. Moreover, on her 1997 trip, she used her 
Syrian passport because:</P> 
 
<P>When I used the Syrian passport at that time, it was -- I thought it would be easier for the Customs, just for things to be easier, and that's the only reason I used it at that time.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on November 14, 2002.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> She responded to Question 16 (<EM>Foreign Countries You Have Visited  Have you traveled outside the United 
States on other than official U.S. Government orders in the last 7 years? (Travel as a dependent or contractor must be listed.) Do not repeat travel covered in modules 4, 5, and 6</EM>) by only listing travel 
to Spain in 1998 and Cyprus in 2002. She failed, however, to list travel to Syria in 1997 and 1999 to visit family and/or relatives. Moreover, she traveled to Cyprus numerous times, including 1992, 
1994, 1997, 1999, and May to August 2002 to visit family and relatives. She did not  disclose travel to Cyprus in 1997, but did list her 1999 and 2002 trips.</P> 
 
<P>Prior to her current job, Applicant worked as an Arabic linguist for another defense contractor. She was a translator for 16 months in Guantanamo, Cuba.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Applicant excelled at this job and received 
accolades from a former coworker, who stated that he had "the highest confidence and trust" in Applicant. He recommended that a security clearance be granted.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Moreover, other professional 
colleagues have attested to her professionalism and character.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Of concern, under the SOR, is Applicant's travel to Syria. Syria, also known as the Syrian Arab Republic, is a Middle Eastern country that has a developing, mixed-sector economy.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> U.S.-Syrian 
relations have a history of difficulty and the U.S. continues to have serious differences with Syria.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Syria did, however, cooperate with the U.S. as a member of the multinational coalition of forces in 
the first Persian Gulf War.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Syria has been on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism since the list's inception in 1979.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Syria continues to provide safe haven and support to terrorist groups.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> 
Syria is ruled by an authoritarian regime that exhibits the forms of a democratic system, but its President has almost absolute authority.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions 
(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and 
material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this 
policy guidance.</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> The government has the 
burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present 
evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against</P> 
 
<P>her.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>A memorandum<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> clarified the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport. The Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition. It contains no mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign 
country. The Guideline requires that clearance  need not be denied or revoked if the applicant surrenders the foreign passport. The memorandum requires that a clearance be denied or revoked unless the 
Applicant surrenders the foreign passport or receives the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.</P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security 
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline C (Foreign Preference</STRONG>):  <EM>The Concern:  </EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. A security concern may be raised by, among other things, the exercise of dual citizenship or some affirmative action 
demonstrating foreign preference as opposed to mere possession of foreign citizenship by virtue or birth.<A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  </STRONG><EM>The Concern:  </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  </STRONG><EM>The Concern:  </EM>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in 
the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a case for disqualification under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Based on the record as a whole, the Government has established its case under Guideline C. In 1997, Applicant used her U.S. passport for a trip, which included a visit to Syria. Applicant used her 
Syrian passport instead of her U.S. passport to enter and exit Syria in 1997. She did not use her Syrian passport for any other portion of her trip. However, in doing so, Applicant held herself out as a 
Syrian citizen by using her Syrian passport. However, when she entered Syria without using her U.S. passport, her travel could not be verified by the U.S., and her whereabouts were only known to her 
and the government of Syria. The security concern underlying Guideline C is that the possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's 
allegiance to the United States is paramount. Since Applicant had her U.S. passport with her, which she used on other segments of her trip, this affirmative action by Applicant, using her Syrian passport 
in Syria, raises a security concern under Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition E2.A3.1.2.2 (<EM>possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>). None of the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions 
exists here.</P> 
 
<P>Moreover, Applicant did not surrender her passport, which expired in 1998, until 2005. Because Applicant used her Syrian passport while in Syria in 1997, she failed to demonstrate suitability for access 
to classified information, which is predicated upon trust and confidence. Surrendering her Syrian passport in 2005 was a gesture made too late, since she could have used her U.S. passport in 1997 when 
she entered and exited Syria.</P> 
 
<P>Even though Applicant appears to be a fully assimilated naturalized American, who has graduated from an American university, has married in the U.S., has a child born in the U.S., possesses and uses 
a U.S. passport, and has expressed a clear willingness to renounce her Syrian citizenship, she did not show allegiance to the U.S. when she used her Syrian passport. Significantly, the facts do not 
support Applicant's contention that is was a coincidence that she has not listed any travel to Syria on either her SF 86 or Screening Form. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's 
case pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. Accordingly, allegation 1.a. of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family members are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries, or financial interests in other countries, are also relevant 
if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>Based on the record as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline B. Applicant's father and brother are citizens and residents of Syria. Her brother is a jeweler, but Applicant 
failed to describe her father so as to permit an assessment of his relationship with the Syrian government. Applicant says she does not have strong bonds of affection toward either her father or brother, 
but she tries to see them whenever she visits. Despite her denial of strong family ties to her brother and father, she visited them without reporting her travels to the U.S. government. Given the 
authoritarian nature of Syria's government, Applicant's travel to Syria could make her and her family vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother is a dual naturalized citizen of the U.S. and Syria, lives in Cyprus, and visits Syria occasionally. The mother is not employed by or connected with the Syrian military, law 
enforcement, or a governmental agency. She is not involved with political, scientific, or commercial organizations or activities which might benefit from obtaining U.S. national security information. 
Accordingly, I conclude she is not an agent of a foreign power. Applicant traveled to Cyprus numerous times, including 1992, 1994, 1997, 1999, and May to August 2002, to visit family and relatives, 
including her mother. Based on the evidence of record, it is plausible that the government of Syria, when the mother is in Syria, could put pressure on the mother, a Syrian citizen, to pressure Applicant, 
who visits her often. This could result in the compromise of classified information. Accordingly, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.1.2.1 (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person 
who whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) and FI DC E2.A2.1.2.6 (<EM>conduct which may make the individual vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government</EM>) applies. None of the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) apply. Applicant has established that the relatives (mother and 
brother) are not agents of a foreign power but that they are in a position to be exploited by Syria in a way that could force Applicant to chose between loyalty to her family or loyalty to the United States. 
Accordingly, FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1 (<EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents 
of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>) does not apply. 
The evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. Accordingly, allegations 2.a through 2.d. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justified confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Based on the record evidence as a whole, the Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant falsified material facts in Questions 16 and 11 by deliberately omitting her travel to Syria 
in 1997 and 1999. Thus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying<EM> </EM>Conditions (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel 
security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>), and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (<EM>personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation 
or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>) apply. None of the 
Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply here. Under the circumstances, Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case. The evidence leaves me with doubts as to 
Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. Accordingly, allegations 3.b. and 3.c. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant. In the FORM, Department Counsel conceded that allegations 3.a. and 
3.d. were mitigated.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-09077.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>I have considered all the evidence in this case. I have also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant is an 
educated, worldly woman who is aware of international tensions, concerns regarding security, and the conduct of business by defense contractors. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this 
case that it is clearly not consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not suitable for access to classified information.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
