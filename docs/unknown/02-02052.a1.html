<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Jennifer L. Plitsch, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has appealed the October 24, 2002 decision of Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr., in which the Judge concluded it is not clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant expressed an interest in preserving his 
French pension; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms 
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 11, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline C 
(Foreign Preference).  A hearing was held on June 26, 2002.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated October 24, 2002, in which he 
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on 
Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant expressed an interest in preserving his French pension</SPAN>.  With one exception, Applicant 
does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings of fact.  Applicant does contend the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant expressed an 
interest in preserving his French pension.<A HREF="02-02052.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant argues that there is no record evidence to support this finding by the Judge, and that the Judge ignored the 
record evidence that Applicant's company pension has been structured so that Applicant would not receive any benefit from his French pension.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal argument focuses on one sentence in the decision below.  On appeal, the Board will not review isolated sentences in an Administrative 
Judge's decision.  Rather, the Board will review a decision in its entirety to discern what findings the Judge made and what conclusions the Judge reached.  <EM>See, 
e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0311 (March 8, 2001) at p. 2.  The sentence cited by Applicant on appeal is not the only place in the decision that the Judge referred to 
Applicant's French pension.  Elsewhere in the decision (at p. 3), the Judge found that "The portion of [Applicant's] total pension attributable to his years of 
French employment is small, and has been structured by the company to be essentially a wash transaction."  That passage shows the Judge did not ignore the 
record evidence that Applicant claims he ignored.  Furthermore, the Judge also specifically noted that Applicant's statements about having an interest in 
preserving his French pension had occurred in the past (Decision at p. 9 n.7).  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's challenged finding is 
sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant contends the Administrative Judge's decision is legally 
flawed because: (a) the Judge failed to consider the favorable evidence presented by Applicant and focused only on the possibly negative evidence; (b) the 
Judge failed to properly evaluate Applicant's case under the whole person concept; (c) the Judge erred by not addressing Foreign Preference Mitigating 
Condition 1; (d) the Judge failed to weigh properly the evidence that Applicant's French citizenship did not stem from emotional ties or loyalty to France, while 
Applicant's U.S. citizenship is based on "emotions and principles" and his long-standing ties with the United States since he left Egypt; (e) the Judge gave 
undue weight to his erroneous finding about Applicant's French pension; (f) the erroneous nature of the Judge's decision is demonstrated by DOHA decisions 
in other cases where applicants were granted a security clearance despite having stronger ties to foreign countries than the ties Applicant has to France; (g) the 
record evidence shows Applicant's preference is for the United States, not for France; and (h) it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to find Applicant "to 
be a trustworthy individual of impeccable integrity" and still make an adverse security clearance decision.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes 
Applicant's arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.<A HREF="02-02052.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>(a) There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  Apart from that rebuttable presumption, a reading of the decision below shows that the Judge considered and 
took into account the favorable evidence Applicant presented.  The fact that the Judge did not give that favorable evidence as much weight as Applicant would 
have liked does not demonstrate the Judge simply ignored it.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0489 (January 10, 2002) at p. 10 ("Merely because a Judge concludes 
that favorable evidence presented by an applicant is not sufficient to outweigh or overcome the unfavorable evidence, such a conclusion does not demonstrate 
the Judge ignored or disregarded the favorable evidence."); ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 3 ("[M]erely because the Judge found 
Applicant's evidence to be unpersuasive does not mean the Judge simply ignored that evidence.").</P> 
 
<P>(b) Applicant correctly notes that the Administrative Judge was obligated to consider his security eligibility under the whole person concept.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, 
Section 6.3; Enclosure 2, Items E2.2.1 and E2.2.3.  As noted earlier in this decision, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  The question on appeal is not 
whether the Board agrees or disagrees with the Judge's specific reasoning and analysis, but rather whether the Judge's reasoning and analysis fall within the 
range of reasonable, legally permissible decision-making entrusted to the Judge under the Directive.  Apart from Applicant's obvious dissatisfaction with the 
result of the Judge's reasoning and analysis under the whole person concept, Applicant has failed to make a persuasive showing that the Judge did not  apply the 
whole person concept in making his decision.</P> 
 
<P>(c) Applicant cites Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1,<A HREF="02-02052.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> argues his French citizenship was "the result of his foreign birth and inability to maintain 
United States residency," asserts that he has reduced emotional ties with France because he obtained French citizenship as a matter of convenience, and claims 
the Administrative Judge failed to address Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1.  Applicant's argument is not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant is not entitled to application of Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 1.  Applicant's French citizenship was 
not the result of his parents' citizenship or Applicant's birth.  Applicant became a French citizen, as an adult, by voluntarily obtaining naturalization as a French 
citizen.   It is untenable for Applicant to fault the Judge for not discussing a mitigating condition which, on its face, clearly does not apply to the facts of this 
case.</P> 
 
<P>(d) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred by failing to weigh properly the evidence that Applicant's French citizenship did not stem from 
emotional ties or loyalty to France.  The record evidence indicates Applicant acted out of reasons of convenience and expediency in obtaining and maintaining 
French citizenship.<A HREF="02-02052.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Applicant's reliance on the evidence that his French citizenship was and has been based on convenience and expediency does not have the 
security significance that Applicant seeks to place on it.  For purposes of Guideline C, a foreign preference can be shown by an applicant's exercise of the rights 
and privileges of foreign citizenship for reasons of personal convenience or expediency.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, August 16, 2000 memorandum by Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, "Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the 
Foreign Preference Guideline" (noting Guideline C contains no mitigating factor related to an applicant's personal convenience).  <EM>Also see, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
01-00677 (May 21, 2002) at p. 5.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge had to consider and weigh Applicant's statements about his motivations and emotions concerning his U.S. citizenship and his French 
citizenship.  However, the Judge was not compelled to consider Applicant's statements in isolation or accept them uncritically.  Rather, the Judge had the 
discretion to consider and weigh such statements in light of his assessment of the record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's arguments do not persuade the Board 
that the Judge acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner when considering and weighing Applicant's statements on this aspect of the case.</P> 
 
<P>(e) Absent a showing that an Administrative Judge acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, the Board will not disturb the Judge's weighing of the record 
evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-11192 (August 26, 2002) at p. 5.  When considered in light of the decision below in its entirety, the Judge's statements 
about Applicant's French pension do not reflect an arbitrary or capricious weighing of the record evidence.  Furthermore, the Judge's statements about 
Applicant's French pension do not appear to be essential or pivotal to his analysis of the case under Guideline C.  Applicant's appeal arguments to the contrary 
are not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>(f) Applicant's reliance on Administrative Judge decisions in other cases is misplaced.  It is legally permissible for Applicant to cite Administrative Judge 
decisions in other cases as persuasive authority.  However, just as the decisions of one trial judge are not legally binding precedent on other trial judges, the 
decisions of Hearing Office Judges in other DOHA cases are not legally binding precedent on the Judge in this case.  Furthermore, the decisions of Hearing 
Office Judges are not legally binding precedent on the Board in any case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 4 (discussing 
precedential value of Administrative Judge decisions).  Accordingly, the Board need not address, distinguish or otherwise comment on the particular DOHA 
decisions cited in Applicant's appeal brief.</P> 
 
<P>(g) The Administrative Judge had to consider and weigh Applicant's statements about his preference for U.S. citizenship over that for his French citizenship.  
However, the Judge was not compelled to consider Applicant's statements in isolation or accept them uncritically.  Given  Applicant's conduct in exercising the 
rights and privileges of French citizenship after Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen, the fact that Applicant has been a naturalized French citizen since 
1971 but a naturalized U.S. citizen only since 1998, and Applicant's conditional willingness to renounce French citizenship, the Judge had a rational basis for 
concluding he had unresolved doubts under Guideline C that precluded a favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>(h) The Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant is a trustworthy individual with impeccable integrity did not, as a matter of law, preclude the Judge from 
making an adverse security clearance decision.  The Judge articulated reasons why, despite his favorable finding about Applicant's trustworthiness and 
integrity, Applicant's conduct and circumstances raised security concerns under Guideline C.  The Judge's articulated reasons are not arbitrary or capricious, 
and they provide a rational basis for his expressed doubt as to Applicant security eligibility.  Given the Judge's expressed doubt, he acted properly by resolving 
it in favor of the national security.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Enclosure 2, Item E2.2.2 ("Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with 
national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.").  <EM>See also Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988)(noting it is proper for 
federal government to err, if it must, on the side of national security when making security clearance decisions).</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> The Administrative Judge's challenged finding appears in the Conclusions section of his decision.  However, "[t]he labels of fact and law used by an

judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so
