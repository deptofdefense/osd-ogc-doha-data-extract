<P>When the Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2001, he lost his Chinese citizenship.  Although he initially retained his Chinese passport, it has since been 
shredded, at the suggestion of a Defense Security Service (DSS) Agent.  The Applicant's parents are citizens of China, but have resided in the U.S. for a 
number of years.  They are medical researchers at an American University.  The Applicant's father has been approved for U.S. citizenship.  The Applicant's 
three remaining grandparents are citizens of and reside in China.  They are all retired and never worked for the Chinese government.  The Applicant's uncle-in-law was a deputy mayor for a Chinese city, but is no longer so employed.  He works for a real estate company, and the Applicant has little contact with this 
distant relative.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 23, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about May 9, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on May 29, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 17, 2003, and the case was heard on July 11, 2003.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called one witness to testify on his behalf.  The transcript was 
received on July 21, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's alleged foreign preference and perceived foreign influence militate against the 
granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">27 years of age, has a 
asters Degree in electrical engineering, and is employed by a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C - Foreign Preference</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant came to the U.S. in 1991, at the age of 15 (Transcript (TR) at page 35 lines 16~20, <EM>see also</EM> Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at pages 1~2).  He 
became a U.S. citizen in 2001, and at the same time renounced his Chinese citizenship (TR at page 36 line 12 to page 37 line 8).</P> 
 
<P>1.a.  After becoming a U.S. citizen, the Applicant still physically retained his Chinese passport (TR at page 28 lines 4~14, and at page 37 lines 11~17).  After 
being apprised of the <EM>Money Memorandum</EM>, however, the Applicant contacted the Chinese Embassy and inquired as to how to surrender his Chinese passport 
(TR at page 29 lines 12~17).  They did not respond to his inquiries (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant next sought the advice of a DSS Agent as to how to comply with the 
<EM>Money Memorandum</EM>, which requires the surrender of any foreign passport (TR at page 29 line 18 to page 30 line 23).  The DSS Agent recommended to the 
Applicant that he shred his passport, which he did (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>2.a.~2.d.  The Applicant's parents are citizens of China, but have resided in the U.S. for a number of years.  His father immigrated in 1989, and his mother 
joined them in 1996 (TR at page 31 line 4 to page 32 line 4, and at page 39 line 13 to page 41 line 7).  They are medical researchers at an American University, 
and have been so employed since immigrating (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant's father has also been approved for U.S. citizenship (Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) at pages 
2~4).  The Applicant's three remaining grandparents, one has passed away, are citizens of and reside in China (TR at page 32 line 5 to page 33 line 7, and at 
page 41 line 8 to page 42 line 10).  They are all retired, and never worked for the Chinese government (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant's uncle-in-law was a deputy mayor 
for a Chinese city, but is no longer so employed (TR at page 33 line 8 to page 34 line 14, and at page 43 line 8 to page 44 line 25).  He now works for a real 
estate company, and the Applicant has little contact with this distant relative, his wife's aunt's husband (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's supervisor recommend's him for "a security clearance without reservation" (AppX C at page 1).  A co-worker of the Applicant also testified at 
length as the Applicant's character, and would also recommend him for a position of trust (TR at page 45 line 14 to page 51 line 17).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN> should be followed in every case <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Preference</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Possession . . . of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference), and Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a foreign preference, or who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are 
harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all 
security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2001, he lost his Chinese citizenship.  Although he initially retained his Chinese passport, pursuant to the 
recommendation of a DSS Agent he shredded his Chinese passport.  I conclude this to be a good faith compliance with the <EM>Money Memorandum</EM>.  Since 
obtaining a U.S. passport, he has only utilized it in his travels.  I therefore also conclude that the Applicant has not only met but has clearly surpassed the 
requirement of the last mitigating condition under Guideline C, which merely requires that he "express a willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  He was 
never a dual national, and is now only a U.S. citizen with a U.S. passport.  Guideline C is therefore found in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's parent reside in the U.S., and have done so for a number of years.  They are researchers at an American University, and his father is in the final 
stages of acquiring U.S. citizenship.  The Applicant's three remaining grandparents are retired in China.  None have ever worked for the Chinese government.  
His uncle-in-law has left the employ of municipal government, and now works for a private firm in real estate.  The Applicant has little contact with this distant 
relative through marriage.  None of the Applicant's immediate family are presently connected with any government, and there is no evidence that their presence 
in China or the U.S. can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant would even consider any such 
attempt at exploitation.  Guideline B is also found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign preference, and foreign influence.  The Applicant 
has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion 
under Guidelines B and C.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P>

clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
