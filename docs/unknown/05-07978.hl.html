<P>Applicant's accrual of  $37,000 of financial delinquencies between 2000 and 2003, and his failure to be forthcoming about them on a subsequent security clearance application generate security 
concerns that he failed to mitigate. Clearance is denied.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On February 10, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued  Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR alleged  security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), and Guideline E (personal conduct). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the 
SOR on February 24, 2006, and elected to have the case decided on the written record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel mailed the government's file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant on October 20, 2006. He received it on November 3, 2006, and was afforded an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. On November 5, 2006, Applicant submitted a two-page response to the FORM. He did not object to any of the submissions 
in the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 20, 2006. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following findings. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 40-year-old married man. He has six children and three stepchildren, ages 11 through 19. He lives with one of his children, and all of his stepchildren, and pays child support for the 
remaining children.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since 2001, Applicant has worked for different employers as a security guard. Before working as a security guard, he worked as a police officer from 1994 to 2001. He has a high school education, 
earning a GED in 1986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has eight financial delinquencies in excess of $37,000. They include a dental bill (SOR subparagraph 1.a), a personal loan (SOR subparagraph 1.b), two car notes (SOR subparagraphs 1.c 
and 1.h), two debts owed to communications companies (SOR subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e), a debt owed to a credit protection company (SOR subparagraph 1.f), and a loan for which </SPAN>he is 
responsible as a cosigner (SOR subparagraph 1.g). All have been delinquent since 2003. He attributes his financial difficulties to a three-month period of unemployment from April 2001 to July 
2001, and to his difficulty in supporting his large family on a police officer's income from 1994 to 2001.<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>All of the delinquencies remain outstanding in their entirety. In November 2006, seven months after answering the SOR, Applicant retained a credit counselor. He provided no evidence that he has 
organized a budget or a debt payment plan.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86) on July 9, 2003. He did not disclose the delinquencies listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d, and 1.f through 1.h, as required, in 
response to either Question 38 (<EM>Your Financial Delinquencies -180 days - In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?)</EM>, or Question 39 (<EM>Your Financial 
Delinquencies  - 90 days - Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?")</EM>.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. They are divided into those that may be considered in deciding 
whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's 
eligibility for access to classified information (mitigating conditions). An administrative judge need not view them as inflexible rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair, common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P> 
 
<P>The following adjudicative guidelines are  raised:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E - Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and 
discussed in the conclusions below.</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the national interest."<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, and based on the evidence contained in the record.</P> 
 
<P>The Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that have been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.</P> 
 
<P>Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such decisions entail a 
certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's loyalty is not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and 
shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's accrual of $37,000 of delinquent debt over the past eight years, and his failure to begin satisfying them trigger the application of Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC 
DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A5.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)</EM>. His difficulties in managing his finances were exacerbated 
by a three-month period of unemployment in 2001. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the 
person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical  emergency, or a death, divorce or separation))</EM> applies.</P> 
 
<P>None of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. Despite working steadily since August 2001, Applicant has not made any payments toward the satisfaction of his delinquencies. Although he has 
retained a credit counselor, he presented no evidence that he has developed or implemented a payment plan, or that his financial problems are otherwise under control</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's omission of his delinquencies from the SOR raises the issue of whether Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) </EM>applies<EM>. </EM>He stated, in his Answer, that he "was confuse[d] by 
then, because there was laps [sic] of times in between debts and he answer[ed] 'no' believing [he] was correct . . ."<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> This explanation is not credible in light of his earlier acknowledgment  that he 
had been struggling with his finances since 1994.<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> I conclude PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2 applies without mitigation.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Concept</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant presented no evidence of any factors such as quality job performance or community involvement that could conceivably reflect favorably on his security clearance eligibility.  Although he 
deserves credit for retaining a credit counselor, this step has limited probative value absent a demonstrated track record of financial reform.<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> In addition, his intentional omission of the 
delinquencies taints his credibility with respect to whether he will restore his credit, as promised in the Response to the FORM. Consequently, upon evaluating his personal conduct and continuing 
financial delinquencies in the context of the whole person concept, particularly, the recency of the conduct,<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> the absence of rehabilitation,<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> the potential for coercion,<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and the likelihood of 
recurrence,<A HREF="05-07978.hl.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> I conclude he has not mitigated the security concerns.</P>
