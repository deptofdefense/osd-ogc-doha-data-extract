<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a </SPAN>history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to the mid 1980s. As of the date he answered the SOR, he had 13 delinquencies 
he has been carrying for many years. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He established </SPAN>circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts. Notwithstanding, he is 
financially overextended and failed to show that he is in control of his finances or that he <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">made efforts to repay creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. He 
lacks a track record of financial responsibility and the circumstances contributing to his financial difficulties are likely to recur. Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 6, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOHA 
adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his access to classified information.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A>On June 4, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer), admitted all allegations, and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">requested a clearance decision based on the written record without a 
hearing.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 28, 2006, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which was mailed to Applicant on March 1, 2006. He 
acknowledged receipt of the FORM on March 8, 2006, and did not object to anything contained in the FORM or submit additional information for 
consideration within the 30-day time period provided to him. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His </SPAN>admissions are incorporated herein as findings of facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings and the 
evidence, I make the following additional findings of facts:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 44 years old; he married his wife in 1981, and has two adult stepsons. It is not clear from his security clearance application (SF 86)<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> whether he 
completed high school, however, he attended a vocational school from 1976 to 1980. He has worked as an electrician from 1984 to the present. With the 
exception of a three-month period of unemployment in early 2002, Applicant has been continuously employed since 1984. Applicant works for a company 
doing business with the Department of Defense (DOD). In April 2002, he applied for a different position within the company and requires access to classified 
information to qualify for the job. There is no evidence Applicant has ever mishandled or otherwise risked the compromise of classified information. </P> 
 
<P>In 1986, a defense investigator interviewed Applicant concerning possible financial concerns.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> After being confronted with delinquencies on a credit report, he 
stated he was not aware of the delinquencies because his wife was in charge of the household finances. He promised to establish payment plans and resolve his 
financial problems.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The credit report used to confront Applicant showed 10 accounts, nine of which were delinquent (bad debts or 90 days due or in 
collection).<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>In December 1996, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, and they were discharged of their debts in January 1997. He had $2,030 in 
assets and $26,849 in liabilities.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In May 2003, Applicant submitted an SF 86 in which he disclosed that in the last seven years he had 10 debts more than 180 days delinquent, nine of which 
were for passing bad checks. He also disclosed six additional accounts in which he was over 90 days delinquent; one involved a bad check. In the general 
remarks section of the SF 86 (question 43), Applicant explained his financial problems were the result of several factors: in 2002 he was out of work for three 
months when he moved from one state to another; in early 2002 he provided financial assistance to both of his adult stepsons; his wife was handling the 
household finances and was writing checks without sufficient funds; and he had additional expenses caused by higher utility and telephone bills.</P> 
 
<P>In April 2004, Applicant provided a statement<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> to a government investigator in which he acknowledged numerous delinquencies reflected on his March 2004 
credit report.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant stated he and his wife were in the process of contacting creditors to make arrangements to resolve their debts. He claimed the debts 
were caused by his unemployment from about January to April 2001,<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> when he moved from one state to another and had no job. His unemployment caused 
him to get behind on many of his financial obligations, and he was now getting back to the point where he could start resolving some of the debts. Applicant 
averred the delinquencies were not caused by their financial irresponsibility, that their current financial situation was stable, and that they were paying their bills 
on time every month. He further stated they had the means and willingness to resolve their delinquencies. Applicant also provided a personal financial 
statement indicating that in 2004 his gross monthly income was $4,000, and after deducting expenses and debts, he had a remainder of $760. However, the 
personal financial statement also indicates Applicant had $18,000 in delinquent debt with no payments scheduled or being made toward this debt.</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges 13 delinquent accounts, totaling $9,153, which Applicant admitted without explanation. Applicant provided no additional information 
concerning when or how he acquired the debts; whether he has paid off any of the debts, or whether has made any effort to resolve the debts as he promised 
when he submitted his SF 86 in 2003. There is no information as to how he intends to resolve his financial predicament or what he has done or intends to do to 
prevent it from happening again. In light of the available evidence, I find that all the delinquencies alleged in the SOR are still outstanding.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. The 
administrative judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition 
is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed 
in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations)<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> is the applicable relevant adjudicative guideline.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's 
eligibility for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government 
based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish by substantial 
evidence<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> a prima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified information. The 
responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant 
carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an 
applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), </SPAN>a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.<A HREF="04-07719.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Similarly, an individual who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in his obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one 
aspect of life can often indicate how a person may behave in other aspects of life.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to the mid 1980s. In 1986, he was confronted by a government investigator about 
his then financial problems, and was made aware of the government's concerns about his financial situation. He acknowledged the problems and promised to 
resolve his financial situation. In 1996, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, and in 1997, he was discharged of $26,849 in accumulated debts. </P> 
 
<P>In his 2003 SF 86, Applicant disclosed additional financial problems compounded by at least 10 checks issued without sufficient funds. As of June 2005, when 
he submitted his response to the SOR, Applicant still had 13 outstanding delinquencies (one of them from 1997, many from 2001 to 2002) totaling $9,153. 
any of the debts alleged are for relatively small delinquencies he has been carrying for years. Applicant's financial problems are recent, not isolated, and 
ongoing. Applicant's unwillingness or inability to honor his financial obligations is evidenced by the delinquent debts he has been carrying for years, and his 
failure to make meaningful efforts to repay creditors or otherwise resolve his financial situation. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1: 
<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and FC DC 3: <EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, </EM>apply in this case. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised several mitigating factors that may be considered as circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his debts -- i.e., his 
2002 move from one state to another with the resulting three months period of unemployment; providing financial assistance to his sons; and the additional 
expenses associated with his move. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 3: <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM> applies. </P> 
 
<P>Notwithstanding the circumstances beyond his control, Applicant presented little or no evidence to show he has dealt responsibly with his financial obligations. 
Other than the 1997 bankruptcy discharge, Applicant presented no evidence of paid debts, settlements, negotiations, payment plans, budgets, financial 
assistance/counseling, or that he has otherwise made any effort to resolve his financial situation. Further, he failed to present sufficient evidence to show why 
his financial problems will not be a concern in the future. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is financially overextended, and his financial situation has already caused him to become overdrawn in his checking account at least 10 times to cover 
his obligations. Applicant's financial history precludes a finding that he has established a track record of financial responsibility. I find that Applicant has not 
taken or is unable to take control his financial situation and failed to demonstrate he is or could be capable of overcoming his financial difficulties. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including Applicant's statements, the circumstances that caused him to 
become delinquent, the actions he took to rectify his financial situation, the whole person concept, the adjudicative factors listed in the Directive, and the 
applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline F security concern.</SPAN></P>
