<P>Applicant is 48 years old and has worked as an engineer for a series of federal contractors since 1981. He has held a secret security clearance since 1982. 
Applicant released proprietary information of his company to an unauthorized foreign national and did not comply with his supervisor's directions regarding 
other proprietary information. Applicant provided testimony that was not believable and in conflict with his previous sworn statement. He failed to meet his 
heavy burden of persuasion to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On May 26, 2004, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) indicating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleged security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E (personal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">June 14, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant denied both 
allegations under Guideline E, personal conduct. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on November 23, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on January 19, 2006, 
scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">February 7, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 27, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government submitted seven exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7. Applicant objected to GE 2 because he believed it duplicated 
other evidence that was offered. I overruled the objection and admitted GE 2. Applicant objected to GE 6 and at the hearing it was admitted over his objection. 
However, I have reconsidered my ruling and find GE 6 is unsigned, redacted and lacks authenticity. Therefore, I overrule my previous ruling and have not 
admitted it into evidence, nor have I considered it for any purpose. All other government exhibits were admitted. Applicant testified on his own behalf, had one 
witness testify, and submitted five exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits A-E. Applicant requested that the Adjudicative Guidelines under AE A,<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
be used to determine security clearance eligibility. Department Counsel objected stating that until implementing provisions have been approved and specific 
direction received from the Director DOHA on the specific implementation date, the current guidelines should be used. I ruled until directed to use the new 
guidelines I am bound by the direction of the Director, DOHA. The objection was sustained. The exhibits were admitted without additional objections.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old engineer, who is married and has two children, and has worked for a series of federal contractors since approximately 1981. He 
began work for Contractor A in about 1995, and left voluntarily in 1999. Prior to working for Contractor A he had been working in a job he enjoyed. When he 
went to work for Contractor A he did not have a great deal of job satisfaction.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> While working for Company A, Applicant did not get along with his immediate 
supervisor or the next level supervisor and had friction with them for 3-4 years. He believed they were micro managers.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In 1999, he and his daughter became ill 
and he decided to take 4-6 months off to care for his child and recuperate. He left Company A because he was sick, his child was sick, he did not enjoy the 
work, he wanted time off, and he did not need the money.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His last day of work at Company A was February 12, 1999. On his last day Applicant downloaded information that was on his government-issued computer 
onto diskettes. The information was not classified. Applicant believed it was standard operating procedure to allow departing employees to download and 
backup information that may help the government later.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He was told it was time to leave the building by the deputy of the research project he had been working 
on and whose team he had worked for. The deputy was an employee of Company A. Applicant wanted to finish downloading information and the deputy told 
him "No, you can't do that. This is [Company A] information and we wouldn't give it to the government."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant was asked at the hearing, "Were you 
instructed to stop downloading the information?"<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> His response was "Well, I had essentially finished at that time. It was like at the very dead-end of the day. 
And I knew what time of day it was, and everybody was leaving. I kind of finished what I was doing, which was trying to pack up my stuff. And when I got a 
chance, I would, like you know, back up anything, you know, after I looked on the files to say well, you know this might be useful for, you know, me or 
someone else later."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant then talked to some military people about possibly coming back and working on a project in a different capacity, but not 
competing with Company A.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He wanted a place to "house" his stuff. He had not thought through what to do with the disks, whether to bring them home or 
transfer them to a government building.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The data that was on the diskettes was not classified. Applicant believed himself to be a subject matter expert in a certain area and thought there were "golden 
nuggets" attributed to himself that he wanted to save. He stated "So quite frankly, my kids have grown up while I was at the [project]. And probably in the back 
of my mind I was thinking, you know, I probably got-you know, I want to go back up anything that says [name] and [name]."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He believed he was allowed to 
back up personal information on the computer to a certain extent. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No evidence was provided regarding what rules and regulations were in place for personnel downloading unclassified, non-proprietary information for backup 
or for personal retrieval. No evidence was provided that the practice was prohibited.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant made a sworn statement on May 31, 2001. He was asked "Did I forward [Company A] proprietary/intellectual information to other companies or 
government officials, specifically the United Kingdom, yes I did."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> He went on to say "the information was not significant proprietary/intellectual information 
that would hurt the company, [Company A]."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> He also stated, </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I shared information with a foreign national, [Person X], United Kingdom, he is a scientist who is assigned to the [project] and worked many projects with us. I 
sent him emails under the context of government understanding and concurrence. Many people knew I was sharing this information with him and they never 
said anything to me about it. The information I sent him was ideas, concepts, studies, general planning information, information that would support current and 
future tasks. My supervisor believed this information to be [Company A] proprietary/intellectual information. I believe my supervisor overstated what was 
[Company A] proprietary/intellectual information.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not provide any credible evidence to show that he had verified that the UK foreign national was authorized to view the material he was providing 
him, nor did he know who the UK foreign national actually worked for, or what he was cleared for. The UK foreign national apparently worked on the staff of 
the same project that Applicant did. At his hearing, Applicant stated with regard to his supervisors believing the information was proprietary, "you know I'm 
really making a speculation there. I have no idea whether he even believed that that was proprietary information&hellip;."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> This statement contradicts his previous 
one. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Evidence of Applicant's character was provided and he is believed to be an extremely thorough analyst and a subject matter expert in his field. He is considered 
an asset to the government. He demonstrates good knowledge of properly controlling information at the appropriate levels and correctly controls classified 
information on a daily basis. Those who provided statements for him have no concern about his willingness, commitment and ability to safeguard classified and 
national security information.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against him.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such classified information.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Based on all the evidence Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.1 (<EM>Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, 
employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances) </EM>applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At his hearing Applicant provided contradictory, inconsistent and confusing testimony about what he believed was proprietary verses intellectual information. 
Applicant was not credible in answering specific questions at his hearing. He failed to respond directly to the questions and would provide convoluted and 
conflicting testimony. His answers were not credible and his testimony attempted to change his previous sworn statement. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">No evidence was proffered by the government to show that downloading information on Applicant's government computer to diskettes was a violation of rules 
or procedures. However, the evidence does show that Applicant was told by a supervisor to stop downloading what the supervisor believed to be proprietary 
information that should not be given to the government and Applicant continued to do so. His conduct in disregarding his supervisor's direction is troublesome 
and shows an unwillingness to comply with his supervisor's directions and a lack of judgment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">With regard to the allegation in SOR &para; 1.b, the government raises the security concern that Applicant forwarded proprietary information to an unauthorized 
recipient. He admitted doing so in a sworn statement of May 31. 2001,<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> although he later retracted it. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He claims with regard to admitting forwarding 
information to a foreign national, he read the statement in a bifurcated way, meaning two separate questions, one referring to proprietary and the other referring 
to intellectual.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> His testimony was not credible</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> and unbelievable.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He admitted when providing his sworn statement he provided the information and modified 
it, initialed changes to it, swore to it and signed it. At his hearing he attempted to distance himself from his active participation in the process.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> He provided 
confusing, convoluted and conflicting answers to questions in an attempt to rationalize his earlier sworn admissions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He stated:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">What I interpreted that statement to mean was, [Applicant], did you forward information to [Company A] considered to be proprietary? And I said or, slash 
intellectual. And I said, yes, you could consider what I said was what, you know, what [Supervisor Y] or somebody else, because they, you know, they sent, you 
know, because I was thinking of the emails that they sent over to [the project] that had, you know, out of the middle of ten pages, this, like one yellow line that 
said this could indicate propriety information.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When asked specifically about sending propriety information, Applicant would change the question to ask "you mean competition specific" and then change it 
again to say "sensitive."<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> Despite repeated attempts to get clear answers to specific questions, Applicant continued to provide confusing and convoluted 
statements. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">His answers were not credible and his testimony attempted to change his previous sworn statement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is a well educated person who has worked for federal contractors for more than 24 years. His supervisor believed certain information Applicant was 
providing to the foreign national was proprietary. Applicant referred in his written statement that the proprietary/intellectual information was "not significant" 
and would not hurt the company. He apparently overruled his supervisor's determination.<A HREF="03-17839.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> Applicant's testimony and written statement indicated to me that he 
was aware of their difference in opinions, believed his supervisor was too cautious in his interpretation of what was proprietary, so Applicant followed his own 
interpretation. In answering numerous questions, Applicant attempted to explain away and rationalize his actions, and also attempted to confuse the issues. 
Based on the questions being asked by both his attorney, government counsel and myself he would redirect the question and change the answer. I do not believe 
Applicant was being truthful, but was rather attempting to rationalize his earlier admissions through confusing testimony. When Applicant was told by his 
supervisor that the supervisor believed information he was downloading should not be shared with the government, Applicant finished downloading the 
information, despite the direction of his supervisor. In the other instance he was aware he was not to release proprietary information, disagreed with his 
supervisor and followed his own determinations. He showed a clear lack of candor in his testimony and repeatedly contradicted himself in his sworn statement 
and testimony. It is clear Applicant is a subject matter expert in his field, but it does not relieve him of complying with the appropriate determinations and 
requirements directed by his supervisors. His conduct is the type that makes him especially vulnerable because he may choose to chart his own course in the 
future with regard to classified information and not comply with determinations that have been appropriately made by others. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.1 applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) and especially considered PC MC E2.A5.1.3.1 (<EM>The information was 
unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, untrustworthiness, or reliability), </EM>and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive 
steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress) </EM>and conclude none apply. Applicant clearly admitted to releasing 
proprietary information to an unauthorized person and continued to download information after being directed to stop. This information is especially pertinent 
to a determination regarding his questionable judgment, untrustworthiness and reliability. His later attempts to misdirect and rationalize his actions raises 
questions as to his reliability and indicate he has not taken positive steps to reduce his vulnerability. Rather his deliberate attempts to confuse, his contradictory 
statements, and his actions when disagreeing with his supervisor raise serious questions about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. I have considered 
the whole person and specifically considered Applicant's age, his motivation, the voluntariness of his action, the length of time he has held a security clearance, 
the information provided regarding his character, and the probability of recurrence and find Applicant has failed to meet his heavy burden of persuasion and 
failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I considered the whole person and I find Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding Guideline E, personal conduct. Therefore, I am persuaded 
by the totality of the evidence in this case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, 
Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
