<P>Applicant was arrested for public intoxication in 1983 but not charged.  He was convicted of driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 1998.  He was terminated from 
his job in January 2005 because he consumed a decongestant containing alcohol before coming to work.  He did not disclose his alcohol-related termination on 
his security clearance application (SF 86) or when initially interviewed by a security investigator.  Applicant refuted the allegations regarding personal conduct 
and criminal conduct.  He mitigated the security concern based on alcohol consumption.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 4, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary 
decision to deny Applicant a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption), E (Personal Conduct), and J 
(Criminal Conduct).  Under Guideline G, it alleges excessive consumption of alcohol from 1983 to January 2005 (&para; 1.a), an arrest in May 1983 for public 
intoxication (&para; 1.b), an arrest and conviction for drunk driving in April 1998 (&para; 1.c), and a termination from employment for reporting to work under the 
influence of alcohol (&para; 1.d).  Under Guidelines E and J, it alleges Applicant committed a felony (&para; 3.a) when he intentionally failed to disclose his alcohol-related termination on his SF 86 (&para; 2.a) and during an interview with a security investigator (&para; 2.b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 17, 2005, admitted the allegation in &para; 1.a in part, admitted &para; 1.c, denied the remaining allegations, offered 
explanations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to an administrative judge on January 23, 2006, and reassigned to me on February 6, 2006, based 
on workload considerations.  On February 13, 2006, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for March 28, 2006.  The case was heard as scheduled.  
DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 7, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend SOR &para; 1.d by deleting the last sentence, which alleged Applicant's blood-alcohol level on 
which his termination of employment was based exceeded the state's permissible level for operating a motor vehicle.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 44-year-old electrician.  He has been selected for employment as a site electrician for a State Department contractor, contingent upon having or 
obtaining a security clearance.  He has never held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regard by members of his community and his current employer.  A retired Air Force colonel who has known Applicant and his family for 
eight years regards him as "a dedicated family man, hard worker and patriot," who is "extremely trustworthy, loyal to his family and friends and to his 
country."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  A local business owner regards Applicant as honest and hard working, and was impressed by "his upbeat attitude, his obvious pride in our country, 
and his genuine compassion for his family and friends."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  A local property manager who has employed Applicant as an electrician and known him for about 12 
years respects him for his workmanship and timeliness.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  A member of Applicant's church considers him "a loyal citizen, a strong family man, church volunteer 
worker," and states he has a reputation as "a fine electrician."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Another member of his church considers him "a conscientious and patriotic person with very 
high morals and character traits."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant's current supervisor regards him as a knowledgeable electrician and a dedicated, conscientious, and hard-working 
employee.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 25, 2005, Applicant executed a SF 86 in preparation for his new job.  He answered "yes" to question 20, asking if he had quit a job in lieu of being 
fired, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance, 
or left a job for some other reason under unfavorable circumstances.  He disclosed he left a job in December 2002 by mutual agreement following allegations he 
was disrespectful to a client.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He also answered "yes" to question 24, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or 
drugs, and he disclosed a conviction of driving while intoxicated (DWI) in March 1998.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant admitted consuming alcohol on a regular basis but he denied abusing it.  He specifically denied the 
allegation in SOR &para; 1.a that he "consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from at least 1983 to at least January 2005."  He testified: 
"I don't do that.  That's just not my nature."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an interview with a security investigator on May 22, 2005, Applicant stated he had not been involved in any alcohol-related incidents at work, such as 
reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  On May 25, 2005, an investigator interviewed one of Applicant's previous employers and 
was informed he was fired in January 2005 for coming to work intoxicated.  The employer stated two managers noticed that Applicant smelled of alcohol, and 
they took him to a laboratory where he was given a blood-alcohol test that showed a level higher than the state allows for operating a motor vehicle.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  The 
employer would not permit the investigator to examine the file, nor would he disclose the identity of the two managers.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The employer refused to permit 
interviews of Applicant's co-workers due to possible "ramifications of a termination."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  The investigator believed the employer's representative, but found him 
guarded and uncomfortable.  He suspected the employer was concerned about a lawsuit.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had not disclosed this incident on his SF 86, nor had he mentioned it during the interview with the security investigator on May 22, 2005.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The 
investigator testified he did not interview Applicant again after discovering the information about his undisclosed job termination.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  The investigator's report is 
dated May 26, 2006.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At Applicant's request, his former employer provided a letter and a copy of the blood-alcohol test, which showed that his blood-alcohol level on January 14, 
2005, was determined to be .016, well below the legal limit for operating a motor vehicle.  The company's letter stated the allegation in the SOR regarding his 
blood-alcohol level was incorrect.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he had been suffering from the flu and took a non-prescription decongestant on the morning of January 14, 2005.  It contained alcohol.  He 
went to work at 7:00 a.m., was summoned to a meeting at 10:00 a.m., and informed he was suspected of consuming alcohol on the job.  He drove himself to the 
laboratory and submitted to a breathalyzer, which reflected a blood-alcohol level of .016.  He returned to work, met with his supervisors, and was informed his 
alcohol level was twice the legal limit for driving in the state.  He pointed his alcohol level was "seven times under the legal limit."  His supervisor responded 
that the company has a "zero-tolerance policy."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant then met with the human resources (HR) director and told him he did not want his work record to reflect an alcohol-related termination.  Applicant 
offered to submit an unqualified resignation, and the HR director agreed his records would not reflect an alcohol-related termination if he resigned.  He told the 
HR director, "You can put they suspected it, and I took the blood test, and then people can draw their own conclusion from that test."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted his letter of resignation and accepted another offer of employment he had received a couple of weeks previously.  The record contains no 
documents from the company reflecting his termination or its characterization.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Applicant provided a copy of his letter of resignation dated January 14, 2005, 
reciting that his resignation "is in order to pursue other opportunities," and stating, "The terms of my departure are amicable."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified the investigator called him a couple of times during the week following the formal interview to verify information.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  Near the end of the 
week, the investigator came to his house and told him that his previous employer said there was a problem with alcohol.  Applicant testified he told the 
investigator there was no alcohol problem, but someone said they smelled alcohol, he took a breathalyzer test, and he passed it.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  He told the investigator he did 
not list his termination of employment on his SF 86 because it was not an alcohol-related termination and he was assured by the HR director that his records 
would not reflect an alcohol-related termination.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  He testified the conversation was short, outside his house, and lasted only for a few minutes.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant testified he had consulted with several medical doctors in preparation for a lawsuit against his former employer.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  He was adamant 
that he resigned from his job, did not leave under unfavorable conditions, and was not terminated for alcohol-related reasons.  During cross-examination by 
department counsel, he would not budge from that position.  He admitted he was told he would be fired for violating the zero-tolerance policy, and he admitted 
he responded by saying he would resign, but he insisted those circumstances did not constitute "leaving a job by mutual agreement following allegations of 
misconduct."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the interview on May 22, 2005, Applicant disclosed an arrest for public intoxication in 1983.  The investigator was unaware of that arrest until 
Applicant disclosed it.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  The arrest was corroborated by a search of public records, which reflect that he was arrested and then "released outright."<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  In his 
answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was arrested but denied he was intoxicated.  He explained that he and several others were arrested after a fight 
occurred at a dance.  He was released shortly after his arrest.  No breath or sobriety tests were administered, and he was not charged.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise from alcohol-related 
incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence.  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para; 1.a, alleging excessive alcohol consumption between 1983 and January 2005, duplicates &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the same conduct is alleged twice 
under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant's favor. <EM> See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 
3 (same debt alleged twice).  Accordingly, I resolve SOR &para; 1.a in Applicant's favor.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The information regarding Applicant's arrest for public intoxication in March 1983 is sparse.  Applicant denied he was intoxicated on that occasion.  There is 
no evidence of a sobriety test or blood-alcohol test.  The official records reflect he was "released outright."  The sparse records and Applicant's testimony 
indicate he was swept up with a number of individuals as a result of a disturbance at a dance and then released shortly thereafter without being charged.  I 
conclude Applicant has refuted the allegation in SOR &para; 1.b., and I resolve it in his favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted his conviction of DWI in April 1998.  This conviction, alleged in SOR &para; 1.c is sufficient to establish DC 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 2) also may arise if there are "[a]lcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or 
impaired condition, or drinking on the job."  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.2.2.  Applicant admitted consuming a non-prescription medication containing alcohol.  There 
is no evidence of his employer's policy, if any, regarding consumption of medications containing alcohol while on the job.  Applicant denied being impaired, 
and there is no evidence he was impaired.  The only evidence was that two unidentified "managers" smelled alcohol and a breathalyzer showed a blood-alcohol 
level of .016.  His employer mistakenly believed his blood-alcohol level exceeded the level permitted for operating a motor vehicle, until Applicant pointed out 
the mistake.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence of the minimum permissible level of blood-alcohol concentration under the employer's "zero tolerance" policy.  The government 
presented no evidence of the physiological implications of a blood-alcohol level of .016, nor did it present  any evidence of safety standards for electricians with 
respect to alcohol consumption or blood-alcohol levels.  However, Applicant produced evidence of the standard employed by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT), Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which does not allow drivers to perform "safety-sensitive functions" if their blood-alcohol 
concentration is 0.02 or higher.<A HREF="05-06750.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  Under the DOT standard, Applicant would not have been considered impaired.  Nevertheless, I conclude Applicant's 
termination of employment was "alcohol-related," notwithstanding the fumbling manner in which it appears to have been accomplished.  Thus, I conclude DC 2 
is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns based on alcohol consumption can be mitigated (MC 1) by showing that "[t]he alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern."  Directive 
&para; E2.A7.1.3.1.  Applicant refuted the allegation of an alcohol-related incident in 1983, but the DWI in 1998 and the alcohol-related termination in January 2005 
were established by substantial evidence.  However, these two incidents do not indicate a "pattern."  They were almost seven years apart and factually 
dissimilar.  The former involved intentional consumption of alcoholic beverages that resulted in impairment.  The latter involved an unwise consumption of an 
alcoholic medication that produced a low blood-alcohol level.  I conclude MC 1 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated (MC 2) by showing "[t]he problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a 
recent problem."  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.3.2.  Applicant's DWI was eight years ago and there is no evidence of recurrence.  I conclude MC 2 is established for the 
1998 offense but not for the job termination in 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several of the general adjudicative guidelines are relevant to Applicant's conduct in January 2005.   The conduct alleged, on-the-job alcohol consumption by an 
electrician, is serious.  Directive &para; E.2.2.1.1.  However, what actually occurred is less serious because of the low blood-alcohol level and absence of evidence of 
impairment.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The circumstances surrounding Applicant's conduct are somewhat mitigating.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.2.  Applicant's blood-alcohol level was not the product of 
social drinking, but a result of his unwise effort to obtain relief from flu symptoms.  His testimony indicates he knew the decongestant contained alcohol, but it 
is unclear whether he knew how much, if any, he could safely consume before going to work.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct was recent, but not frequent.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.3.  His consumption of alcoholic medication before going to work appears to have been a 
one-time occurrence.  He was a mature adult and experienced electrician when the conduct occurred.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.4.  He voluntarily consumed the 
alcoholic medication, although it is not clear whether he was aware of its effects.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.5.  His motivation was relief from flu symptoms, not 
personal enjoyment, stress relief, or other motivations usually associated with alcohol consumption.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.7. His conduct did not expose him to 
potential pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, because it was documented in his personnel file and he readily disclosed it when questioned.  Directive &para; 
E2.2.1.8.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, the likelihood of recurrence is very low.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.9.  Notwithstanding one employer's effort to terminate him, Applicant enjoys a reputation 
as a capable, conscientious, and hard-working electrician.  It was clear from his testimony and demeanor at the hearing that he understands the adverse 
consequences of alcohol-related misconduct on the job and has no desire to repeat his January 2005 experience.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concern based on alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A disqualifying condition (DC 2) under this 
guideline may be established by "deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 3) also applies when an 
applicant deliberately provides false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator or security official in connection 
with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.  Directive &para;E2.A5.11.2.3. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant's state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is 
direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 
17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed an employment termination under unfavorable circumstances on his SF 86, disclosing his resignation after being accused of discourteous 
conduct.  He also disclosed his 1998 DWI conviction.  During the security interview, he voluntarily disclosed his 1983 arrest for public intoxication.  These 
disclosures suggest candor and lack of intent to conceal derogatory information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is a facial conflict in the evidence, in that the security investigator testified he did not interview Applicant again after learning of the alcohol-related job 
termination, but Applicant described several subsequent conversations with the investigator regarding what the employer had told the investigator.  The 
investigator was available as a rebuttal witness after Applicant testified, but he was not recalled to contradict Applicant's testimony.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have concluded that Applicant's testimony is consistent with the investigator's.  The initial interview was on May 22, 2005, a Sunday.  Applicant testified 
there were several telephone conversations and a brief personal interview outside Applicant's house "at the end of the week."  The investigator learned of the 
alcohol-related job termination on May 25, 2005.  The investigator's report is dated May 26, 2005, a Thursday.  What appears to have occurred are several brief 
follow-up inquiries between May 22 and May 26, concluding with a brief conversation on May 26 about the alcohol-related termination, after which the 
investigator completed his report.  It appears that none of these follow-up inquiries rose to the level of what the investigator would have considered a second 
formal interview.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the possibility that Applicant chose to disclose the earlier, less serious events but intentionally omitted the more recent and serious alcohol-related termination, hoping the HR director for his former employer would adhere to their oral agreement to not characterize the event as alcohol-related.  
However, after considering all the evidence, I have reached a contrary conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I am satisfied Applicant should have disclosed his termination by a previous employer on his SF 86 and during his interview with the security investigator.  The 
evidence regarding this incident is sparse because of the employer's refusal to cooperate with the security investigator, but it establishes Applicant was 
suspected of alcohol-related misconduct on the job.  It is not clear whether he was suspected of being impaired, drinking on the job, or both.  The evidence also 
establishes that he and his employer agreed that he would resign, and that the evidence of his 0.016 alcohol concentration would remain in his file so that future 
employers could make their own judgments about the evidence.  Applicant was well aware of the potential adverse consequences of being terminated for an 
alcohol-related incident on the job, and he believed he had negotiated a solution to avoid those adverse consequences.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">However, based on his testimony, his responses and demeanor during vigorous cross-examination, and all the evidence in the record, I am also satisfied 
Applicant does not understand that a baseless or unfounded allegation of misconduct followed by a mutually agreeable termination of employment must be 
disclosed in response to question 20 on the SF 86.  In his mind, if there was no misconduct, there is no duty to disclose.  He believed he had resigned under 
"amicable" conditions.  He did not believe his separation from employment was included in the scope of question 20 on the SF 86.  I conclude Applicant did 
not intentionally omit relevant and material facts from his SF 86 or during his interview with the security investigator.  Accordingly, I conclude DC 2 and DC 3 
are not established, and I resolve SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b. in his favor.</SPAN></P>
