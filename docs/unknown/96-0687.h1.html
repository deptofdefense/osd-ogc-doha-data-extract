<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On December 2, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant responded to the SOR on December 5, 1996 and requested a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was reassigned to this Administrative Judge on
January 15, 1996 after having been previously assigned to another Administrative Judge on
December 20, 1996.  On February 4, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant's
security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of five exhibits; Applicant relied on his
own testimony.  A transcript of the proceedings was received on February 12, 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted without explanation the factual allegations pertaining to personal
conduct under Criterion E, the factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct under Criterion
J., and the factual allegations pertaining to misuse of information technology systems under
Criterion M.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is a 23 year old employee of a defense contractor with a Bachelor's Degree in
computer science.  He has worked for his current employer since April 1995 and is currently
applying for a secret clearance.  A favorable preliminary determination could not be made in his
case because of evidence that he had been involved in criminal misconduct and in the misuse of
information technology systems, and because he had then not been truthful in disclosing this
information to the Department of Defense (DoD) during the background investigation conducted
by the Defense Investigative Service (DIS).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	While Applicant was attending college (from 1990 to 1994), he worked in the academic
computer center (ACC) of the university (where he was enrolled) from June 1991 to June 1993. 
The ACC provided computers and many different, copyrighted software programs for student
and faculty use.  Applicant has admitted that he copied three of the center's software programs
unto to  disks for personal use on his own computer during the time he was employed by the
ACC.  He has admitted that his actions were both illegal and unethical (Gov. Exh 2).  During the
same time frame, Applicant accepted a software program which a friend of his had copied at the
ACC.  He knew that accepting copied software was a violation of copyright laws.  Applicant has
explained that he copied the software so that he could complete work at home that had been
assigned to him by the ACC.  Because of his knowledge of computers, he was consistently
"bothered" by people seeking advice (Tr. 62).  It became impossible for him to finish his work at
ACC. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Later during his college career (from June 1993 to May 1994), Applicant worked at the
university's technology transfer center (TTC).  Again, he made copies of copyrighted computer
software programs for use on his own computer.  And again, Applicant used most of the copied 
software to complete work on assignments for his employer.  However, he also made copies for
friends on one or more occasions (Gov. Exh. 2).  The software which Applicant copied for
himself without authorization was also available for sale from his employer at a substantial
discount (Tr. 60).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Although Applicant never asked permission to copy ACC or TTC's software, he believed
that both employers knew that copies were being made (Tr. 73).  He has rationalized that his
actions were permitted--with respect to some of the software--by "something known as a
shared license."  Under this arrangement, copyrighted software could be re-copied on a home
computer as long as it was used "eighty percent of the time" on the second computer for
completion of the principal licensee's work.  However, Applicant admitted that he had never
asked his employers' permission with respect to any of the programs he had copied. (Tr. 73)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	From 1992 to 1994, Applicant worked part-time for a company that sold tickets to -------
events.  While employed in that capacity, he participated in an unauthorized and illegal scheme
to the detriment of his employer.  He sold large blocks of tickets to scalpers--against his
employer's rules-- and accepted substantial tips from the scalper in return for the favor. 
Applicant also participated in a scheme whereby he would print tickets and then void them on the
computer.  He would then sell the printed tickets to scalpers or give them to friends.  Applicant's
participation in these schemes was not limited to one or two occasions, but was a regular
occurrence during his tenure with this employer.  He estimates that he earned $500.00 in
kickbacks from scalpers, and that he eventually stole between 300 and 400 tickets from this
employer in the two years that he worked for the company.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When asked to explain why he had stolen the tickets, Applicant identified "greed" as the
principal motivation (Tr. 45).  He had become frustrated because he not received a pay increase
from this employer in the time he worked for him (Tr. 46).  Earlier, in his first statement to the
DIS (Gov. Exh 3), Applicant admitted that he knew stealing the tickets was wrong, but did it
anyway.  In the same statement, he explained to the DIS "that what some people might regard as
unexplained affluence" was attributable to the fact that he had grown up in "a family of
substantial means," and had had grandparents who had been "very generous."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	As a result of his illegal activities, Applicant was arrested for larceny of tickets in July
1994.  The charges against him were dropped after Applicant admitted that he had taken some
tickets for his own use and agreed to reimburse his former employer $3,000.00.  Applicant now
admits that the value of the tickets stolen during the time of his employment was far in excess of
that amount (Tr.  48-49)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When he was first interviewed by the DIS on June 24, 1996, Applicant stated specifically
that he had not copied any copyrighted computer software programs during the time that he was
employed by ACC (Gov. Exh. 3).  He acknowledged that he had been arrested in July 1994 and
charged with grand larceny--a felony.  However, he admitted that he had taken only 50 to 100
tickets from his former employer.  He did not admit that the actual number of tickets he had
stolen from his former employer was between 300 and 400 until the second DIS interview.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	On his own behalf, Applicant testified that his involvement in the incidents alleged in the
SOR was attributable to immaturity. He has learned from his mistakes and has become a better
person.   He is now married and has a wife and child about whom to be concerned.</FONT></P>

Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye

Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria E, J and M.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	There is a common thread which runs through the allegations in the SOR.  Applicant engaged
in illegal activity after becoming frustrated in a work environment.  At ACC and NTT, he copied
computer software without asking permission because he wanted to work at home rather than at his
employer's facility where he was being "bothered.".  When he became frustrated with his work at
the ticket sales company because he had not received a pay increase, he stole tickets to quiet his
frustration.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's illegal actions are particularly bothersome because in each instance, he ignored
obvious legal alternatives to engaging in activities which in addition to violating the law, also
violated the trust of an employee--employer relationship.  He could have asked his employers for
permission to copy the software which would have enabled him to work at home.  He could have
purchased the software at a deep discount instead of resorting to an illegal and unethical means of
self help.  Applicant copied the software because it was easier than asking his employer's
permission, and cheaper than purchasing the software.  When he became frustrated in his work for
the ticket company, he could have quit.  He has indicated that he did not need this job to provide the
necessities of life (Tr. 68).  His family has "substantial means" and his grandparents have been "very
generous."  Applicant stole because he was greedy, not because he did not have a viable alternative. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant then compounded his mistakes by not being honest and forthright about his
activities when he was interviewed by the DIS, and when he signed the sworn statement on June 24,
1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Criterion E applies to "the deliberate omission...of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire...or deliberately providing false and misleading information...to an
investigator in connection with a personnel security...determination."  Facts are considered relevant
and material when they are capable of influencing a federal agency's decision, e.g., a decision to
grant or deny a security clearance.  In this instance, Applicant's unauthorized copying of at least
three copyrighted computer software programs from a former employer falls well within the
definition of materiality.  When he was initially asked about this activity during the first DIS
interview, Applicant specifically denied that he had copied any software programs from his
employer (Gov. Exh. 3).  During the same interview, Applicant did not tell the truth about the
number of tickets he had stolen from his former employer.  He indicated that the total number of
tickets stolen was between 50 and 100, when he had actually stolen between 300 and 400 tickets. 
This information was also relevant, material, and capable of influencing the DoD's decision on
whether to grant Applicant a security clearance.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	While Applicant is credited with eventually telling DIS the truth about the software copying
and the ticket theft, there is no evidence that he made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the
falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Nor is the falsification on Applicant's first
statement to the DIS mitigated by the explanation he provided at his administrative hearing.  His
testimony that he did not  think the copying issue would come up during the DIS interview (Tr. 32)
does not excuse lying about it when--contrary to those expectations--the issue did come up.  He
testified that he did not tell the truth about the number of tickets he had stolen during the first DIS
interview because he was nervous about being arrested again (Tr. 43-44).  While Applicant's concern
is understandable, it does not justify his signing a statement which included information that he
knew was not true.  Criterion E is concluded for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion J.  Applicant has admitted that
he stole tickets from his former employer with a value of several thousand dollars.  As a result of his 
theft he was arrested for grand larceny, a felony.  The charges against Applicant were later dropped
after he agreed to reimburse his former employer $3000.00. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has also admitted that he was not truthful to an agent of the DIS when he was first
interviewed on June 24, 1996.  On that occasion, Applicant lied when he stated that he had never
copied copyrighted software from a former employer.  He lied again when he stated that he had
stolen only 50-60 tickets from his former employer.  He eventually admitted that he had stolen
between 300 and 400 tickets from this employer.  Applicant's willfully withholding this information
from the DoD on matters that were clearly relevant to his security clearance eligibility violates 18
U.S.C. &sect;1001.  The information withheld by Applicant had the potential to influence the course of
his background investigation in areas of legitimate concern to the DoD. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	As mitigation for stealing tickets from the ticket sales company, Applicant has explained that
he experienced "a serious level of frustration" when he was required to work "80 and 90 hour weeks
and there was no compensation for overtime."  Had the ticket theft occurred on one, isolated
occasion, Applicant's explanation would be understandable and his one-time theft could be attributed
to youthful indiscretion.  However, it happened several times.  Applicant had allowed the frustration
to build where he could justify committing a crime.  Instead of quitting at that point, he continued
to work in that environment and he continued to steal tickets from his employer.  Applicant's
explanation for not being truthful about illegally copying computer software has been discussed (see
above).  Criterion J is concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	With respect to Criterion M, Applicant has admitted that he copied several (six or more) 
computer software programs from two former employers without asking their permission or
otherwise receiving proper authorization.  Applicant knew that these programs were protected by
copyright, and he has known since the age of 16 or 17 that it was "wrong" to copy such programs
under the circumstances (Tr. 28-29).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's efforts to explain his actions provide some insight into how and why he did what
he did, but his explanations do not mitigate the security concerns raised by his improper activities. 
He testified that he did not understand the implications of copying software when he first began
using  computers ten to twelve years ago.  He and his friends routinely exchanged and copied
computer programs from each other (Tr. 27) because he did not realize it was improper or unethical,
and his parents did not know enough about computers to correct him (Tr. 28).  Notwithstanding this
lack of guidance from his parents, Applicant still learned that copying software was wrong.  He
testified that by the age of 16 or 17, he knew it was "wrong" to copy copyrighted software programs
(Tr. 28-29).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	I have carefully considered the circumstances under which Applicant copied software
programs from his employer.  Favorable consideration has been given to Applicant's testimony that
he copied these programs primarily so that he could complete his employers' work assignments on
his home computer (Tr. 63).  Favorable consideration has also been given to Applicant's testimony
that he did not personally profit from any of the software which he had illegally copied from his
employers.  However, this favorable evidence must be weighed against Applicant's testimony that
he had never asked his employer for permission to copy the software so that he could complete
assignments on his home computer,<A HREF="96-0687.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> and against Applicant's testimony that he compounded his
illegal activity by distributing copies of some of the illegally copied software to his friends (Tr. 73). 
He has acknowledged that his friends did not use this software to complete work which had been
assigned to Applicant (Tr. 63).  Criterion M is concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>
