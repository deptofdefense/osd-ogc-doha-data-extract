<P>Applicant married a Taiwanese citizen who is a permanent U.S. resident and aspires to be a U.S. citizen.  His wife's mother, sister and brother are citizens and 
residents of Taiwan, but are not connected to the Taiwanese government or military.  His wife has weekly telephonic contact and monthly mail contact with her 
mother and sister, but she has virtually no contact with her seven-year-old Taiwanese son from a previous marriage who is in the sole custody of her Taiwanese 
ex-husband.  Applicant cannot communicate with his in-laws because of the language barrier.  He visited Taiwan twice, once to visit his future wife and once to 
be married.  Security concerns based on foreign influence are mitigated.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 14, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.<A HREF="02-30752.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR sets out a security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive based on four allegations: 
Applicant's spouse is a citizen of Taiwan residing in the U.S. (&para; 1.a.); Applicant's mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of 
Taiwan (&para; 1.b.); Applicant's spouse has weekly telephonic contact and monthly mail contact with her mother and sister (&para; 1.c.); and Applicant traveled to 
Taiwan on September 3, 2000 and April 10, 2001 (&para; 1.d.).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 21, 2004.  He admitted the allegations, offered explanations, and requested a hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to 
me on August 20, 2004.  On August 25, 2004, DOHA issued a notice of hearing setting the case for October 5, 2004.  Applicant appeared as scheduled.  DOHA 
received the transcript (Tr.) on October 26, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During cross-examination of Applicant, Department Counsel elicited the fact that Applicant's wife had a Taiwanese son from a prior marriage.  Applicant did 
not object at the time.  After the hearing, Applicant asserted it was improper to elicit this information because it was outside the scope of the SOR.  I have 
determined that Applicant's objection is untimely, without merit, and moot in light of my decision to grant a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 39-year-old senior engineering technician for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his present employer since June 2002.  He previously held 
a security clearance during his four-year enlistment in the U.S. Marine Corps, and it was administratively terminated after he was released from active duty.  
While in the Marine Corps, Applicant received meritorious promotions to private first class, lance corporal, and corporal.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant met his wife in February 2000 through an internet dating service while she was a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  His future wife, along with her 
mother and sister, came to the U.S. on a combined business and pleasure trip and visited Applicant during the Memorial Day weekend in 2000.  In September 
2000, Applicant traveled to Taiwan for seven days to visit her.  She returned to the U.S. with him, and she remained in the U.S. on a tourist visa until she 
returned to Taiwan on March 10, 2001, to attend her father's funeral.  On April 10, 2001, Applicant traveled to Taiwan for six days to marry her.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife returned to the U.S. in June 2001 and became a permanent U.S. resident.  Her primary motivation for coming to the U.S. was to be with 
Applicant.  She intends to become a U.S. citizen as soon as she is eligible.  Applicant and his wife have a two-year-old son who is a native-born U.S. citizen.  
Applicant and his wife wanted their son to hold only U.S. citizenship.  Accordingly, they did not register their son with Taiwan's National Registry or document 
him in any way as a Taiwanese citizen.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was previously married in June 1985 and divorced in January 1989.  He has a 19-year-old daughter, a native-born U.S. citizen, from his first 
marriage.  Applicant's wife also was previously married.  She was divorced about five years ago and has a seven-year-old son from her first marriage.  Her 
previous husband and their son are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  Her previous husband, a Taiwanese court employee, has sole custody of their son.  
Applicant's wife has only infrequent correspondence with her son and does not provide any financial support.  Applicant has never met his wife's son.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife worked as a graphic designer for a food company while she was in Taiwan.  Since she came to the U.S., she has done occasional graphic arts 
work but is not employed full-time.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law is deceased.  His mother-in-law and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  His mother-in-law owns a herbal medicine 
shop and employs his sister-in-law in the shop.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother-in-law is a research and development manager for a Taiwanese manufacturer of industrial valves.  The valves are used in commercial, 
nonmilitary applications.  Except for his brother-in-law's mandatory military service, none of Applicant's in-laws are employed by or have any relationship 
with the Taiwan government.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's spouse has weekly telephonic contact and monthly mail contact with her mother and sister.  The mail from Applicant's in-laws is limited to gifts of 
clothing and toys for Applicant's infant son and occasional greeting cards. The mail from Applicant's spouse to her mother and sister consists of crayon artwork 
from their son and occasional greeting cards.  Applicant has very little contact with his in-laws because they cannot speak English and he cannot speak Chinese, 
except for a few polite phrases.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother-in-law and sister-in-law have visited the U.S. twice, once before Applicant and his wife were married and once when Applicant's son was 
born.  Applicant's in-laws have no desire to live in the U.S.  Applicant's wife has visited her mother twice, in May 2004 and about May 2003, but she has no 
desire to live permanently in Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taiwan is a multiparty democracy, with a good human rights record.  On the other hand, Taiwan is an active collector of defense, medical, economic, and 
computer information through industrial espionage.<A HREF="02-30752.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Taiwan maintains a large military establishment, and its primary mission is the defense of Taiwan against 
the PRC.  The Taiwan Relations Act, U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 3301-3316, is the legal basis for the unofficial relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan and the U.S. 
commitment to ensuring Taiwan's defensive capability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has first-hand experience with economic espionage and violations of U.S. export laws.  As the result of violations of U.S. export laws by a former 
employer, Applicant lost a highly-paid position.  In his present position, he enjoys a reputation for hard work, dependability, high integrity, and exemplary 
adherence to security protocols.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander-in-Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admission that his spouse 
is a citizen of Taiwan establishes DC 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Sep. 22, 2003).  Applicant's wife's ties to Taiwan and the possible effect they may have on Applicant's conduct are relevant considerations under Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence).  ISCR Case No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 21, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> "[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or 
obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."   ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
Furthermore, a disqualifying condition (DC 2) may arise if an applicant is "[s]haring living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship 
status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists." Applicant's admission that his in-laws are citizens and residents of Taiwan establishes DC 
2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who are connected with a foreign government, 
a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters) . . . are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power").  Since the Government has produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 and DC 2, the burden has 
shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding 
classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or 
country has interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Although Taiwan historically has been 
regarded as friendly to the U.S., the distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, 
sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, even friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or 
national security. Finally, we know that even friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and 
technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, 
its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to 
government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family 
member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's wife is a citizen of Taiwan, she has become a permanent resident of the U.S. and aspires to become a U.S. citizen as soon as possible.  
She has ensured that her two-year-old son will have only U.S. citizenship.  She is not an agent of a foreign power or in any way connected with the government 
of Taiwan.  Her professional training and experience as a graphic artist make her an unlikely target or means of economic espionage.  She has close ties with 
her mother and sister, but their social and economic positions, owning and operating a herbal medicine shop, do not offer a likely opportunity for exploitation.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The maternal relationship between Applicant's wife and her son from a previous marriage appears to be virtually nonexistent.  Her ex-husband has sole 
custody.   She has little contact with her son and provides no financial support.  By electing to live in the U.S., she has voluntarily increased the geographical 
and emotional distance between herself and her son.  Her ex-husband is a court employee and not associated with industry, industrial technology, or the 
military.  Thus, it is unlikely he will attempt to exercise influence through Applicant's wife and her son. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother-in-law is not associated with the Taiwanese government or military.  He works in industry, but his work is limited to commercial, 
nonmilitary applications.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns can be mitigated by showing that contact with foreign citizens is casual and infrequent (MC 3).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant's 
inability to speak Chinese limits his contacts with his in-laws to occasional polite phrases. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering each family member's individual circumstances, I conclude MC 1 is established with respect to Applicant's wife, MC 1 and MC 3 are 
established with respect to his in-laws.  Neither Applicant's wife nor any of his in-laws are employed by or connected to the Taiwanese government.  
Furthermore, none of them are associated with a political, military, commercial, or other activity that would benefit from the products of industrial espionage or 
U.S. national security information.  After considering the totality of Applicant's family ties, I conclude that the security concerns based on Applicant's family 
ties to Taiwan are mitigated.</SPAN></P>
