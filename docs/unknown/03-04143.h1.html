<P>Applicant deliberately omitted from his security clearance application (SF-86) his 1996 arrest for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and relevant information 
about his debts. He drinks to the point of intoxication at least once each month and continues to drink and drive. He has failed to mitigate the resulting security 
concerns about his personal conduct (Guideline E) and his alcohol consumption (Guideline G). Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On December 8, 2003, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns about his personal conduct and alcohol consumption. The SOR informed 
him DOHA adjudicators, based on available information, could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On February 17, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), admitting the allegations therein at subparagraphs 1.a,<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 1.b, 2.b, and 2.c, and requested a 
determination without a hearing. On May 5, 2004, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) with five exhibits (Items 1 - 5) 
attached in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was sent to Applicant the next day. Applicant received the FORM on May 24, 
2004 and was allowed  30 days to submit additional information in his own behalf. However, he did not respond to the FORM by the June 23, 2004 deadline, 
and the case was assigned to me on July 7, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 31-year-old installer employed by a defense contractor full-time since March 2002. This appears to be his first application for a security 
clearance.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 23, 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI. The case was <EM>nolle prosequi </EM>two months later, but the reason why is unclear. Applicant 
contends the charge was dropped because Applicant's blood alcohol content (BAC) when he was arrested was below the legal limit of .10% in that jurisdiction. 
He also claims his attorney told him that there would be no record of his case.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> However, during an interview with a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent on 
or about October 22, 2002, Applicant acknowledged his arrest, admitted he was legally intoxicated at the time, and did not know why the charges were 
dropped.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant first consumed alcohol in 1990, when he was 18 or 19 years old. Since then, he has consumed alcohol once or twice weekly, and becomes intoxicated 
at least once each month. He has continued to drink and drive since his 1996 arrest, and "will continue to drink and drive while legally intoxicated."<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 31, 2003, Applicant submitted an SF-86, from which he omitted his 1996 DWI arrest by answering "no" to question 24. This question requires 
disclosure of any alcohol- or drug-related arrest "regardless of whether the record in [the] case has been 'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the record."<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> In the 
aforementioned DSS interview, Applicant stated he chose not to disclose the arrest on his SF-86 because he thought the government would not find out about it. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the same SF-86, in response to questions 38 and 39 regarding delinquent debts, Applicant disclosed only that he had been delinquent on one credit card 
from January 2000 until January 2001. However, the DSS credit check revealed Applicant was delinquent on at least five accounts.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant deliberately 
omitted this information because he was afraid he would lose his (then) new job if he listed all of his debts.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline G (alcohol consumption).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion on the issue of whether, despite the government's information, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Excessive alcohol consumption is a security concern (Guideline G) because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has established, through 
Applicant's admissions and the exhibits included with the FORM, a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is undisputed that Applicant was arrested for DWI in 1996 as alleged in SOR 1.b. Although the charges were eventually dropped, it is also clear he had been 
drinking before he drove. The record evidence here consists of Applicant's statement to DSS and his Answer. His Answer admits the arrest, but claims the 
charge was dismissed because his BAC was below the legal limit. Attached to the Answer is a statement by the prosecutor in Applicant's case, but the 
statement says only that the DWI charge was <EM>nolle prosequi </EM>and that the author was a licensed attorney at the time. On the other hand, in his statement to DSS 
Applicant clearly admits the arrest and that he was legally intoxicated when he was arrested. A charge may be <EM>nolle prosequi </EM>for any number of reasons, 
including that advanced by Applicant in his Answer. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant has not provided sufficient information to support his claim that he was not legally 
intoxicated. Despite being afforded an opportunity to submit information to rebut the FORM, he has submitted nothing further that might buttress his position. 
Therefore, he has failed to meet his burden of persuasion on this point.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to his October 2002 statement to DSS, since Applicant began drinking as a teenager in the early 1990's, he has consistently consumed alcohol at least 
twice weekly, and he drinks to the point of intoxication at least once each month. Despite an arrest for DWI in 1996, he has driven after drinking, conduct he 
intends to continue in the future. (SOR 1.a) Again, in response to the government's case as set forth in the FORM, Applicant has been silent. In his Answer to 
the SOR, Applicant denied he drinks to intoxication each month, a controverted fact the government proved through Applicant's own statement to DSS. Yet 
Applicant has provided no information to overcome the government's case on this point.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The facts alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b are fully supported in the documents included with the FORM and warrant application of Guideline G disqualifying 
condition (DC) 1<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 5.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Of the Guideline G mitigating conditions (MC), only MC 1<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies in that one DWI arrest does not constitute a pattern of 
alcohol-related incidents. He has been arrested only once; however, I believe MC 1 affords Applicant little benefit in light of the fact he has continued to drink 
and drive after his DWI. That he has not been arrested more than once or injured himself or another through his disregard of laws against driving while 
intoxicated is simply dumb luck. Applicant's willingness to continue to drink to excess at least 12 times a year and, possibly, drive under the influence calls into 
question his judgment and reliability. I view of the foregoing, and in light of questions about Applicant's truthfulness (discussed below) which weigh against 
the claims in his Answer, I conclude Guideline G against the Applicant. 
Personal conduct (Guideline E)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government is concerned with Applicant's 
allegedly deliberate falsification of a security clearance application. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer, Applicant admits he falsified his answers to his SF-86 questions 38 and 39 
regarding past due debts. (SOR 2.b and 2.c) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed one debt greater than 180 days delinquent, but he had other delinquencies at the time that he 
should have listed as well.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In his 2002 statement to DSS, Applicant stated he did not list his other debts because he was concerned about possible adverse 
effects a full disclosure of his financial problems might have on his employment status. 
Applicant also omitted his DWI arrest from the SF-86 by answering "no" to question 24 regarding alcohol-related offenses. By the plain language of the 
question, Applicant was required to provide this information even if the charges had been "sealed or otherwise stricken from the record." In his 2002 statement 
to DSS, Applicant acknowledged his arrest, stated he did not know why the charges were dismissed, admitted he was legally intoxicated when he was arrested, 
and stated he answered "no" to question 24 because he "did not want to provide the government with information the government might not be able to find."<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> 
Department Counsel has presented sufficient evidence in the FORM to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline and I conclude that 
Guideline E DC 2<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies here.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Department Counsel has proven the controverted allegation in SOR 2.a based on Applicant's 2002 statement, and Applicant 
has admitted SOR 2.b and 2.c.  
By contrast, only Guideline E MC 4<A HREF="03-04143.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is potentially applicable here. In his Answer, Applicant asserts the affirmative defense that he relied on advice of his 
attorney to the effect that Applicant did not have to list the arrest because the charges were dismissed and there would be no record of it. Applicant provided the 
name of the attorney and suggested DOHA call him to verify his claim. However, Applicant bore the burden of presenting evidence to support his defense and 
it is not Department Counsel's job to conduct additional investigation to obtain information supportive of Applicant's claims. Further, Applicant's position is 
undermined by the fact he said nothing about acting on advice of counsel when he was interviewed in 2002; instead, he admitted he had deliberately falsified 
his SF-86 because he did not think the government would find out about the arrest. Finally, Applicant did not provide, in response to the government's 
argument and exhibits in the FORM, any additional information about his claim that he was so advised by counsel. None of the remaining mitigating conditions 
apply, either through lack of factual relevance or lack of support in the record.  
I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concealment, misrepresentation, or omission of a material fact in the SF86 is an act of great security significance.  
In addition to its interest in a proper security clearance decision, the Department of Defense has a significant interest in ensuring that false and misleading 
information does not interfere with its security clearance investigations. Additionally, the Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust in those to 
whom it grants access to classified information. Applicant's intentional omission of relevant information from his SF-86 undermines the government's 
confidence he can be relied on to properly fulfill his obligation to safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. 
I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair and commonsense assessment of the 
record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. These facts raise reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to 
exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to resolve 
those doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I conclude the record evidence weighs in favor of the government's decision to deny Applicant access to 
classified information.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">
