<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old naturalized citizen whose family members are citizen residents of Taiwan.  Applicant has lived in the United States for 30 years, has 
worked for a defense contractor for 24 years, had held a security clearance for 17 years without incident, holds a passport only from the United States, and has 
no property in or financial ties to Taiwan.  Under these circumstances, Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from the foreign residence of her 
family members.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive"), the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On March 9, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on April 3, 2004, and admitted all the factual allegations.  She elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on May 25, 2004.  Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of her opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on June 18, 2004, but did not provide additional materials for consideration.  The case was assigned to me on July 
27, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified information 
shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of 
character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and 
willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>In order to be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
<P>Guideline B - Foreign Influence:  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions which disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to 
classified information.  Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified 
information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>The Government's documentary matters and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of two disqualifying conditions under Guideline B of the 
Directive.  Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1, provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Applicant's brothers are close family members, and sister-in-law and nephews are persons to whom she has close ties of affection.  All reside in Taiwan presently, although her eldest brother has applied to emmigrate to 
the United States.  The substantial evidence is sufficient to raise security concerns under &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The substantial evidence also presents a disqualifying condition under &para; E2.A2.1.2.3, which arises when "relatives . . . are connected with any foreign 
government."  Applicant indicated that one of her nephews is a career soldier.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These factual circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive, &para; 
E2.A2.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 ** 33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Where there is a potential for foreign influence, security concerns can be 
mitigated where it is determined that the immediate family members or associates in question are not agents of a foreign power, and they are not in a position to 
be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States.  Directive, &para; 
E2.A2.1.3.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters.  The evidence indicates 
that none of Applicant's immediate family members are agents of a foreign power.  Her brothers living in Taiwan are retired, and there is no indication they 
work for or are associated with a foreign government.  This aspect of the mitigating condition applies to all her relatives in Taiwan, except her nephew who is a 
soldier.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 2.  Although there is no information indicating the nephew's position within the armed forces, he meets the definition of an "agent of 
a foreign power" under &para; E2.A2.2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In determining whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, a judge should consider several factors, including the character of the government of the 
relevant foreign country.  Department Counsel submitted Item 6, the National Counterintelligence Executive Office's Annual Report to Congress on Foreign 
Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage for 2000.  The report includes a summary of a survey of a dozen Fortune 500 companies that indicated Taiwan is 
one of the most active collectors of foreign economic information or industrial espionage.  At the same time, one must recognize that Taiwan is a democracy, 
and its political system has made dramatic advances recently in protecting human rights and personal freedoms.  Taiwan has a long history of friendly relations 
with the United States, including substantial levels of foreign trade.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor to be considered is the Applicant's vulnerability to duress.  Applicant's contact with her brothers in Taiwan is limited to telephone 
calls approximately every other month, and personal visits about every four years.  Her contact with her nephew who is a service member is limited to 
infrequent telephone calls and her personal visits.  While this shows regular and continuing contact, it does not appear to be especially close.  Applicant's 
closest relative-her mother-resides in the United States.  It is also significant that Applicant has lived in the United States for 30 years, has become a 
naturalized citizen, and has all her personal and property interests in this country.  Moreover, Applicant has held a security clearance for 15 years without 
adverse incident.  There is no evidence that Applicant has engaged in any illegal or conspicuous action while visiting Taiwan that would make her especially 
vulnerable to foreign influence.  These circumstances indicate Applicant is not vulnerable to duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is also a mitigating condition that foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.  Directive, &para; 
E2.A2.1.3.5.  In this case, it appears that Applicant has no financial interests in Taiwan.  To the contrary, all her financial interests, including her employment, 
her real property, her personal property, and her financial resources are within the United States.  The significant nature of these contacts reduce the likelihood 
that a person so situated would engaged in conduct threatening to the security of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all these circumstances and weighing the various factors in light of the "whole person concept," I find Applicant has mitigated the security 
concerns arising from having family members residing in Taiwan.  For these reasons, I find that Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
