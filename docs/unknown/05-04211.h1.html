<P>Applicant's use of marijuana has been mitigated by his expressed and demonstrated commitment to a drug free lifestyle.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On July 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 8, 2005, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on September 7, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 16, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 11, 2005.  At the hearing the 
Government presented four exhibits.  The Applicant presented five exhibits, called two witnesses, and testified on his own behalf.   The official transcript (Tr.) 
was received on November 3, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 44 years old, single and has four years of college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Electronic Engineer, and is seeking to retain 
his security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has abused illegal substances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1977, at the age of seventeen, while in junior high school, the Applicant began using marijuana.  He used it two or three times on weekends with his friends.  
It made him dizzy and nauseated so he stopped using it.  (Tr. p. 27).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2004, the Applicant was granted an interim security clearance.  In September 2004, the Applicant used marijuana again when he ran into a high 
school acquaintance that he had not seen in fifteen years.  At the time, the  Applicant was going through a stressful period in his life.  His father had just passed 
away, his house had been burglarized, and his wife was going through counseling.  His friend had offered to help with some remodeling on his house and 
offered him some marijuana.  The Applicant took three drags on the marijuana cigarette and got violently ill.  (Tr. p. 33).  The following week, the Applicant 
underwent a random urinalysis at work and tested positive for marijuana.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 3).  The Applicant was referred to his company's Employee 
Assistance Program (EAP) and referred for counseling.  The Applicant completed the counseling.  Applicant's substance abuse assessment indicates that he has 
no addiction history of either alcohol or illegal substances.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibit B).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Applicant's Senior Program Manager testified that company policy requires them to try to rehabilitate an employee on their first incident of illegal drug 
abuse by sending them to counseling and by constantly monitoring their progress.  If the employee tests positive a second time, they are automatically 
terminated from their employment.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since testing positive for marijuana in September 2004, the Applicant has been tested on at least five other occasions and the results have been negative.  The 
Applicant is also subjected to regular random drug testing that will continue indefinitely.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant indicates that he has no intent of ever using marijuana again.  He no longer associates with anyone that uses marijuana.  He has learned from his 
mistakes.  To deal with the pressures of life that he experiences now, he is more active, does a lot of hiking, motorcycle riding with his family who all have dirt 
bikes and is more involved in his daughter's school.  He attends church and spends a lot more time with his children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two witnesses testified on the Applicant's behalf including  his Senior Program Manager and the Chief Engineer at the range.  Both of these individuals 
consider the Applicant to be an excellent worker, who is extremely reliable and trustworthy.  (Tr. pp. 53-64).             </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's performance evaluation from October 2004 through September 2005, indicates that he either "exceeds" or "meets" the standards in each category.  
(<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit C).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters of recommendation from coworkers and friends of the Applicant attest to his high level of integrity, responsible nature, his good judgment, and his 
competence and expertise in the field.  He is considered an asset to the work force.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit A). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following 
Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline H (Drug Involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. any drug abuse;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in drug use that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has  engaged in illegal drugs use (Guideline H).  This evidence indicates 
poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is 
a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case under Guideline H of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) any drug abuse</EM> and <EM>(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution</EM> 
apply.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the particular facts of this case, the Applicant's marijuana use was isolated.  He first used it several times in junior high school in 1977.  He used 
it again about twenty three years later in September 2004.  He realizes that he made a stupid mistake when he used it last year and that he must never use it 
again.  Since then, he has not used marijuana and had no intention of ever using any illegal drug again.  He has matured and has learned to deal with stress by 
engaging in other more constructive things.  He no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs.  He understands that the use of illegal drugs is 
prohibited by law and against DoD policies.  He also understands that holding a security clearance is incompatible with illegal drug use.  There is no evidence 
that the Applicant has engaged in illegal drug involvement since September 2004, over a period of one year.  Given the fact that the Applicant's isolated drug 
use occurred over a year ago, there is no indication of recent drug use, and there is a credible commitment to remaining in a drug free lifestyle in the future, 
sufficient rehabilitation and mitigation has been shown.  Mitigating conditions </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>(1) the drug involvement was not recent,</EM> and <EM>(3) a demonstrated intent not to 
abuse any drugs in the future</EM> are applicable.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly Guideline H is found for the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence 
supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    Subpara.  1.a.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    Subpara.  1.b.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    Subpara.  1.c.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
