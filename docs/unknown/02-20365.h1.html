<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor. He was born in Lebanon and continues to hold dual citizenship consistent with the policy 
that regards anyone of Lebanese descent as always a citizen of their country. At the advice of the Department of State because of terrorist attacks against U.S. 
citizens, he used his Lebanese passport to travel there on several occasions ending in 1999. He owns a small parcel of land in Lebanon which is not of sufficient 
value to cause him to be under foreign influence from that country. Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 18, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry,</EM> as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated September 11, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 
November 14, 2003. A hearing was held on February 4, 2004. The Government introduced six exhibits at the hearing and the Applicant introduced one. All 
exhibits were accepted into evidence. The transcript was received on February 10, 2004. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted some of the specific factual allegations in the SOR and denied others. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old engineer employed by a defense contractor with an annual salary of approximately $110,000.00. He holds a doctoral degree from a 
major U.S. university. He was born in Lebanon and continues to hold dual citizenship with that country. The government of Lebanon regards anyone of 
Lebanese descent as always a citizen of their country. He is married to a native  born U.S. citizen whom he met and married in Iran where they were both 
studying in 1965. His wife also holds dual citizenship with Lebanon that she applied for in 1990. They have three children all of whom are U.S. citizens.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant emigrated to the U.S. in 1969 and became a U.S. citizen in 1973 at which time his Lebanese passport was returned to him by U.S. immigration 
authorities. Between 1973 and 1999 Applicant used his Lebanese passport a number of times when traveling to Lebanon to visit his family. On every occasion 
he advised his employer of the trip and was debriefed after his return. He had been advised by the Department of State that use of the Lebanese passport was 
desirable since there was a civil war extant much of the time and American citizens were being targeted. (Department of State Travel Warning, May 2003). It 
was considered that there was less likelihood of problems if one traveled with a passport of Lebanon. He did not travel there between 1976 and 1980 when the 
civil war was at its peak. </P> 
 
<P>His last trip to Lebanon when he used his Lebanese passport was in 1999 to attend a wedding of a relative. During that trip the Applicant and his wife 
accompanied his son by auto to Damascus on a day trip. His son was working in the Middle East for the American Friends Service Committee had an 
appointment with the U.S. Ambassador to Syria (Exh. A).</P> 
 
<P>His Lebanese passport expired in 200l and he used his U.S. passport to travel to Lebanon in 2002, his only trip since 2001. He has not applied for a new 
passport of Lebanon and does not intend to do so as he has no need for one since there are fewer problems for American now and his family needs for travel do 
not exist. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant worked as an engineer in Lebanon before his emigration to the U.S. and maintains some professional and personal contacts with his former 
colleagues. Since his emigration he has had a varied career and his profession took him to Saudi Arabia where he worked between 1980 and 1987 for a U.S. 
contractor working on pollution control projects. His present work involves environmental cleanup for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of 
Energy, Department of State, and Department of Defense.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's youngest son was told to report for duty in the Lebanese army and the family successfully resisted the effort of the government of Lebanon and he 
was declared exempt.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant owns approximately 24 acres of land in his family village in the hills north of Beirut. A relative has valued it at approximately $100,000.00 but that is 
only an estimate and there is no market since access is limited to foot travel. It is not arable and consists of several smaller parcels that Applicant purchased 
from other relatives who needed funds. The land was passed down from their great-grandfather to these extended relatives. Applicant intends to sell it when and 
if there is a market for it. </P> 
 
<P>The closest relative of Applicant who still live in Lebanon is a nephew. Other cousins still live there. Applicant helped get his parents, a brother, and two 
nephews out of Lebanon and to the U.S. </P>

<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and</P> 
 
<P> maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; 
E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive 
Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
Applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the Applicant's clearance. "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; 
E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</P> 
 
<P>The applicable Guidelines cited in the SOR concern the following Disqualifying Conditions (DC):</P> 
 
<P>1. Foreign Preference, Guideline C:</P> 
 
<P>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include the  exercise of dual citizenship (E2.A3.1.2.1), or possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport. (E2.A3.1.2.2.)</P> 
 
<P>An applicable mitigating condition is that the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship. (E2.A3.1.3.4.)</P> 
 
<P>	</P> 
 
<P>   2. Foreign Influence, Guideline B:</P> 
 
<P>A security risk may exist when an individual has a substantial financial interest in a country that could make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure. (E2.A2.1.2.8.)</P> 
 
<P>An applicable mitigating condition is that the foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities. 
(E2.A2.1.3.5.)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the following with 
respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government has stated reasons to deny him a security clearance because of foreign 
influence and foreign preference.  Having established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence that refutes, 
mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 
99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant has successfully moved all close relatives out of Lebanon. Although he used the foreign passport on several occasions before 1999, he did so on the 
advice of the Department of State because of the targeting of U.S. citizens by terrorist groups. His passport is expired and he has no interest in obtaining a new 
one showing his preference for U.S. citizenship. </P> 
 
<P>Mitigating Condition (MC) 4 is applicable as to Guideline C in that Applicant is willing to  renounce his dual citizenship, but does not know how to do so in 
view of the policy of Lebanon on dual citizenship. </P> 
 
<P>Although he has a financial interest in Lebanon through the acquisition of the interests of several family members of the family farm, it is a of minimal concern 
to him in view of his income and long term commitment to the U.S. over the past 30 years. MC 5 is applicable under Guideline B since the foreign financial 
interest is not sufficient to affect Applicant's security responsibilities. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Thus, after considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant clearance to the Applicant. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
 
<P>       </P> 
 
<P>      Paragraph 1 Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER">Subparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for 
Applicant.</P>
