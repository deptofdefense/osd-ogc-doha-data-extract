<P>Applicant has mitigated security concerns about his alcohol-related arrests in college and provided evidence that he has reformed his conduct.  He now curtails 
his drinking and is changing his lifestyle.  He performs well on the job without any evidence of recurrence of an alcohol problem.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 2, 2004.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="03-22671.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleged specific concerns over alcohol  consumption (Guideline G) in paragraph 1.  Applicant responded to these SOR 
allegations in an Answer notarized on September 20, 2004, where he admitted all of the allegations and requested a hearing. </P> 
<P>Department Counsel on January 4, 2005, indicated the case was ready to proceed.  The matter was assigned to me on January 5, 2005. Subsequently, a mutually 
convenient date for hearing was agreed to.  A Notice of Hearing, issued on February 25, 2005, set the matter for March 16, 2005, at a location near where 
Applicant works and lives. </P> 
<P>At the hearing the Government offered two exhibits which were admitted into evidence. (Exhibits 1-2)  Applicant testified and was allowed two weeks after the 
hearing until March 30, 2005, to submit additional evidence.  The Government had until April 1, 2005, to submit comments.  (TR 15-16; 25-26)   On March 17, 
2005, Applicant submitted Exhibit A; on March 28,  2005,  he submitted Exhibit B; and on March 30; 2005, he submitted Exhibit C.  On April 4, 2005, 
Government's counsel indicated he had no objection to the documents, so Exhibits A, B, &amp; C were admitted into evidence; and the record closed.  The 
transcript (TR) was received on March 24, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P>Applicant, 28 years old, worked for a defense contractor (Employer #1) in State #1 from October 2002 until he was laid off in April 2004.  He completed a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in February  2003. (Exhibit 1; TR 12-13, 18, 20-21)  Because of the delay in having his security clearance approved, he 
left that job and began work at a new company (Employer #2) in November 2004.  For the current job he does not need a security clearance, but he would need 
one if he were to go back to work for his first employer.  (TR 12, 19, 21-22)  Applicant graduated from college with a B.A. in May 2002. He is single. (Exhibit 
1; TR 11-12)</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Alcohol</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 2003, Applicant reported on the frequency of his drinking: he began to drink in high school at graduation parties where he had one to two beers.  
In his first year in college, he drank one to two times monthly and consumed six or seven beers on each occasion.  In his second year, he drank one to two times 
weekly and consumed ten to twelve beers at each party.  In his junior year, he began to drink more, usually one night during the week and on the weekends he 
would consume ten to twelve beers on each occasion.  (Exhibit 2)  Applicant at times drank to excess and had two alcohol-related arrests on the college 
campus:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In May 1999 Applicant was arrested for Disorderly Conduct Hazardous/Physically Offensive and issued a citation where he plead guilty in May 1999 and 
paid a fine of $125.  Prior to the arrest he had consumed alcohol at a number of parties celebrating the end of the school year.  (Answer; Exhibits1, 2; TR 15-16)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In April 2001 Applicant was arrested for Harassment/Strike, Shove, Kick.  When he left a party where he had consumed alcohol, he had made some jokes 
that another person took the wrong way.  Consequently, that other individual punched Applicant in the back of the head and in the face.  Applicant was bleeding 
profusely and was taken to a medical facility.  Because the stories were incompatible, citations were issued against both parties.  Applicant's charge was later 
dismissed.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2; TR 16-17)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After he moved off campus his senior year, Applicant drank only on the weekends when he consumed ten to twelve beers.  After college he lived at home and 
consumed two or three beers several times weekly at home.  After he got a job in October 2002, he drink only on  the weekend two to three beers if he was 
driving and five to six beers if he was not.  (Exhibit 2; TR 14)   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After Applicant lost his job because his past alcohol-related arrests had delayed his security clearance, he has decreased the amount he drinks.  (TR 11, 14; 21-22)  Also, Applicant has a girlfriend who does not like drinking.  However, he still drinks three to four beers when he goes out.  (TR 14, 17) As he matures, 
Applicant is "weaning" himself away from the lifestyle he used to have.  (TR 19)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>References</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's technical supervisor at Employer #1 stated that Applicant maintained an elevated level of responsibilities at work.  He never came to work 
intoxicated or became intoxicated during work hours.  (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor at Employer #1 stated th he directly supervised Applicant from October 2002 to April 2004.  Applicant functioned at a high level in the 
day-to-day production activities assigned to him.  He had no attendance or tardiness issues; he never came to work under the influence of alcohol or became 
intoxicated during work hours.  He was an excellent employee at all times and demonstrated professionalism.  (Exhibit B)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's college friend who has known him for six years and who now shares an apartment with him confirmed that Applicant has substantially lessened his 
drinking.  Applicant now drinks a few drinks once or twice a month.  (Exhibit C)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline G --</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established security concerns over Applicant's two alcohol-related arrests  in 1999 and 2001 when he was in college.  Thus, Applicant's 
conduct falls within DC 1:  Alcohol-related incidents away from work. . . . .  Applicant has never been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant mitigated these security concerns as Applicant provided evidence to demonstrate that he falls within several mitigating conditions:<A HREF="03-22671.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The 
first arrest in 1999 while he was in college occurred over five years ago;  the more recent college arrest in 2001 was dismissed.  As the 2001 case was 
dismissed, his arrests do not indicate a pattern under MC 1. He has had no subsequent arrest in over four years.  Thus he falls within MC 2.  (the problem 
occurred a number of years ago, and there is no indication of a recent problem) and MC 3 (positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety).  Applicant's 
arrests and periods of heavy drinking occurred when he was in college.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Recently, he has addressed these alcohol concerns by substantially curtailing his drinking and changing his life-style.  Now he is older, more mature, out of 
college, and gainfully employed.  His college friend and current roommate confirms that Applicant has substantially lessened his drinking and has matured.  
While attendance at AA combined with abstinence would provide a stronger case, he provided evidence that his drinking did not affect his work life.  His work 
performance has been excellent.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, there is no indication of a recurring problem with alcohol.  Significantly, he had an excellent record of performance on the job for the 18 months he 
worked for Employer #1 where he needed a security clearance.  To his credit Applicant was viewed by his supervisor as functioning at a high level in the day-to-day production activities assigned to him.  He had no attendance or tardiness issues and never came to work under the influence of alcohol or became 
intoxicated during work hours.  Overall Applicant was an excellent employee at all times. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. though 1.c.. under SOR 
Paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process 
section, I make the following formal findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline G:     FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.:     For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.b.:     For Applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.c.:     For Applicant</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P>
