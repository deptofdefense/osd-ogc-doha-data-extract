<P>Applicant and her husband accumulated several debts prior to their divorce in 1997.  Because of a significant drop in their disposable income after Applicant's 
husband went on disability status in late 1994 following a work-related accident, they experienced considerable difficulty in keeping up with their debts.  
Repossession of their recently purchased boat ensued in 1995, and two of the other debts accumulated by Applicant and her husband during their marriage 
became delinquent as well.  Applicant's repossession and sale resulted in excess sales proceeds being remitted to her, and she credibly demonstrates to be 
working to resolve the other two listed debts satisfactorily.  Applicant  is credited with both extenuation and mitigation.  Clearance  is granted.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 23, 2002<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on December 21, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on February 14, 2003, 
and was scheduled for hearing on March 18, 2003.  A hearing was convened on March 18, 2003, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of four 
exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including herself) and six exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on March 26, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 32-year old logistics analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is alleged to be indebted to several creditors: creditor 1 for $7,496.00, which was charged off in April 2002; creditor 2 for $694.00, which is more 
than 120 days past due; and creditor 3 for $351.00, which has been submitted for collection.</P> 
 
<P>For her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted her debts to creditors 2 and 3, but denied any debt to creditor 1.  She explained that the creditor 1 debt 
involved the financing of a boat, which preceded an unfortunate injury to her ex-husband.  She claimed the boat was repossessed by the bank and sold at 
auction for more than the amount owing.  She claimed the bank forwarded a check of $2,000.00 to her and the debt should not be reported to credit agencies.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>While they were still married (married in 1989), Applicant's husband (H) purchased an 18-foot  inboard motor sea ray ski boat.  He made his purchase (jointly 
with Applicant) in March 1993 for $11,212.00, financing it through creditor 1.  When H purchased this boat, he and Applicant were current in all of their 
accounts.</P> 
 
<P>Sometime in 1994, H was injured on the job and went on disability status.  With their income severely curtailed as the result of H's accident, they could no 
longer keep up their payments on the boat, but did manage to pay the monthly interest and work with the lender in making payment arrangements (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 
26-27, 33-34).  Not satisfied with their interest only payments and future proposals, however, creditor 1 repossessed the boat in November 1995 and sold it at 
auction for more than the amount of the outstanding balance: then around $7,496.00.  Within a month of the sale, creditor 1 sent a check to Applicant for about 
$2,100.00: This represented the excess proceeds received by creditor 1 over the loan balance (<EM>see </EM>ex. A; R.T., at 26-27, 35-36).</P> 
 
<P>In May 1996 (before her divorce from H in 1997), Applicant and H went to buy a new boat from creditor 1 but were denied financing.  After explaining the 
circumstances of the first bank loan with creditor 1, a new lender (Bank A) financed the second boat purchase (<EM>see </EM>exs. D and E).  Applicant paid off this 
second boat purchase several years ago (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 41).  Besides this second boat, which she still owns, Applicant has since purchased three cars, each 
financed with Bank A.  Each time the creditor 1 repossession would show up in her credit report, the lender would accept her explanation and grant her the car 
loans.  Equifax has since removed the repossession from her credit report.  Applicant currently has eight accounts with Bank A (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 41-42). </P> 
 
<P>The creditor 2 debt involved a furniture purchase, which Applicant's ex-husband took with him and agreed to pay, but did not.  While the creditor 3 debt is 
legally Applicant's, it represents a  gift from H, on which he stopped paying after making a few payments.  Applicant  is currently negotiating with this creditor 
3 over her proposal to satisfy the debt with a lump sum payment of $200.00 in return for the creditor's removing the debt from her credit report (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 
51). She  assures of her intentions to seek a negotiated pay-off with creditor 2 as well.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant currently lives within her means on a $30,000.00 salary, which is supplemented by child support payments she receives from H for her second child.  
She receives no child support payments from her first husband on her first child, who is now 19 years of age.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by the branch manager of a Government switching operator, who Applicant reports to.  He finds her to be very trustworthy.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: The behavior was not recent.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By reason of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose 
of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant  accrued several debts during her marriage that became delinquent following her ex-husband's accident and ensuing work loss.   Disabled as the 
result of a work-related accident in 1994, Applicant's husband could no longer work and make the full payments on their boat purchase. With their available 
income they made interest only payments on the boat for a number of months but to no avail in satisfying the boat lender.  Ultimately, the lender repossessed 
the boat and credited Applicant and her husband back with the surplus sale proceeds.  For reasons unexplained, the repossession continued to show up on their 
credit report.  The other two delinquent debts are relatively small in amounts delinquent ($694.00 and $351.00, respectively) and are the subject of  either 
ongoing or intended Applicant repayment negotiations.</P> 
 
<P>Because of her husband's medical problems associated with a work-related accident and ensuing disability status, Applicant and her husband were unable to 
take care of several of their debts during a period prior to their divorce in 1997.  Two of the listed debts (though small) are still unresolved; their accumulation 
is security significant: enough to enable the Government to invoke two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial 
considerations: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts). </P> 
 
<P>Of these three debts covered in the SOR, one (creditor 1.a) is credited to Applicant as fully discharged by repossession and resulting return of excess sale 
proceeds.  Both of the remaining debts (creditors 1.b and 1.c) are being worked on by Applicant. On these facts, Applicant is able to demonstrate not only 
extenuating circumstances accompanying her covered debts, but earnest good faith attempts to pay off the remaining two debts (creditors 1.b and 1.c) with the 
monthly surplus she has available.   Following the repossession, Applicant and her husband were able to reestablish their credit with another boat lender, with 
whom Applicant currently has eight accounts in good standing.  Applicant has continued to exhibit responsible credit and money management since her divorce 
and is well regarded in her work as a reliable and trustworthy performer.</P> 
 
<P>Based on her testimony and admitted documents, Applicant's covered debts are both extenuated and mitigated by circumstances and time  and earnest 
repayment efforts.  Applicant may take advantage of several mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate and mitigate her actions: MC 1 
(behavior not recent), MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) and MC 6 (initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors).  Favorable 
conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.c of the Adjudicative Guidelines governing  financial considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative 
Guidelines of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
