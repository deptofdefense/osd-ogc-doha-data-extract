<P>Security concerns about an allegation of inappropriate sexual contact with his daughter, and related criminal and personal conduct concerns were not established. The financial concerns are mitigated 
because Applicant settled his largest debt before the Statement of Reasons was issued, and the others were incurred by his ex-wife. However, he failed to overcome criminal and personal conduct 
concerns presented by his deliberate omission from his security clearance application (SF 86) of information about his arrest record and a car repossession. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On August 9, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts in Applicant's background 
investigation that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline  D (sexual behavior), Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline F (financial considerations), and Guideline J 
(criminal conduct). Applicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>This case was originally assigned to another administrative judge on February 17, 2006, but transferred to me on March 1, 2006. I convened a hearing on April 27, 2006. The parties appeared as 
scheduled and the government presented 16 exhibits and one witness (Gx.1 - 16). Applicant testified and presented four exhibits (Ax. A- D). DOHA received the transcript of hearing on May 9, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 33 years old and has been employed as an outside mechanic since March 2003 by a defense contractor supporting construction, maintenance, and overhaul of U.S. Navy nuclear submarines. 
He served as an Engineman Third Class Petty Officer (EN3; paygrade E-4) in the U.S. Navy from 1993 until 2003. Applicant married his first wife in June 1993. They separated in January 2000 and 
divorced in October 2001. They had two children, a boy and a girl, now ages 12 and 10, respectively. Applicant remarried in July 2002, and lives with his wife and stepdaughter. He held a security 
clearance when he was in the Navy, but submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on March 14, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1999, Applicant and his first wife obtained a new vehicle. His wife negotiated the deal, which Applicant thought at the time was a purchase financed through the dealer. Applicant signed 
the paperwork for this transaction at the dealer. He now asserts it was actually a lease. When they separated in early 2000, Applicant's wife took the vehicle, but returned it to him in 2001. Applicant 
claims he never missed a payment, but the finance company took the vehicle from him in August 2002. Applicant claims the vehicle was not repossessed in the traditional sense, but was actually an end-of-lease return. The dealer subsequently notified him he owed more than $12,000, which Applicant believes was for excess mileage. After receiving collection notices in April and May, 2004, Applicant 
tried to negotiate a payment plan he could afford. He settled this debt in June 2004 for about $3,250.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After they separated and he moved out, Applicant's first wife failed to pay bills for their internet service and their satellite television service. The two bills total $461 and one was placed for collection in 
August 2001. She  also opened a clothing store account in his name and there is an unpaid collection account for $201 attributable to Applicant.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He has challenged the clothing store debt as fraudulent, 
and he does not intend to pay this debt. Applicant was not aware of any of these delinquencies until he was interviewed during his background investigation in January 2004.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his separation,  Applicant usually saw his children when his estranged wife needed a babysitter. On June 16, 2000, she and her boyfriend went away for the weekend while Applicant stayed 
with the children at his wife's home (formerly the marital residence). She returned on June 18. On June 20, she called the police and alleged Applicant had sexually abused his then five-year-old 
daughter by touching the girl's "private parts," by putting his finger in her rectum, and by inserting the end of a small plastic toy into her rectum.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The police investigation included a statement from Applicant, in which he denied any wrongdoing, his ex-wife's statement about what she believed happened based on conversations with their children 
and with Applicant, the results of an interview of Applicant's daughter by a child welfare caseworker, the results of a hospital physical examination of the child, and the results of laboratory analyses of 
the child's underwear and the toy allegedly used by Applicant. The lab results and physical examination were inconclusive as to whether any abuse had occurred. During the police investigation into this 
matter, Applicant's visitation rights were first suspended, then limited to supervised visits only.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by the police on June 27, 2000. He denied any wrongdoing during the weekend in question. Applicant was not under arrest and did not respond to requests by the police for 
additional interviews. Because he was still on active duty with the Navy, the police sent their reports and findings to the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) at Applicant's duty station and 
asked NCIS to assist in the investigation by interviewing the Applicant. On March 1, 2001, an NCIS agent took a statement from Applicant in which he again denied doing anything wrong or 
inappropriate with his daughter.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 20, 2001, Applicant met with an NCIS polygraph examiner. Before this interview, the NCIS examiner had reviewed Applicant's March 1 statement and the local police investigation 
records.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The interview began at 3 p.m. and ended around 9 p.m., when Applicant gave a written statement in which he acknowledged he may have accidentally touched his daughter in an inappropriate 
way when he, his daughter, and his son were wrestling and playing during the weekend in question.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant was optimistic the matter would be resolved favorably and agreed to return the next day 
for another interview.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant appeared for his interview on March 21, the NCIS agent accused Applicant of having lied the day before. The agent drafted a statement containing most of the information found in the 
civilian police reports. Applicant signed the statement because he thought it was the only way he would get to see his children again.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The NCIS statements were then sent to the civilian authorities who 
arrested Applicant on May 15, 2001, and charged him with one count each of 1<SUP>st</SUP> degree child sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor, both felonies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant subsequently obtained legal counsel with whom he worked closely in preparing a defense.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> On February 19, 2003, after several continuances, the local prosecutor had the charges dismissed 
when Applicant's ex-wife refused to cooperate and make her daughter available as a witness.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 14, 2003, around the time he began working for his current employer, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86). In response to question 21, which required him to disclose 
if he had ever been charged with or convicted of a felony, Applicant answered "no." In response to question 35, which required Applicant to disclose if he had any property repossessed for any reason in 
the prior seven years, he answered "no." In response to question 38, which asked him to list any debts during the prior seven years that were more than 180 days delinquent, and question 39, regarding 
debts more than 90 days past due at the time, he answered "no."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Aside from the unpaid debts discussed, above, Applicant does not have any financial problems. He also has not had any other adverse contact with law enforcement, and there is no indication in the 
record that his military service was anything other than satisfactory. Finally, there is no information to suggest he has had any disciplinary problems at work.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance decisions must reflect consideration of 
both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of each case. Pursuant to Section 6.3 of the Directive, each decision must also reflect 
a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors collectively referred to as the "whole person concept" and listed in Section E2.2.1.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The presence or absence of a disqualifying or 
mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they 
represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified information. The 
government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government 
must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government does so, the burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. A person who has 
access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Because the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant 
possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own, no one has a right to a security clearance.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The "clearly consistent with 
the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Accordingly, applicants bear a heavy burden of 
persuasion in the face of disqualifying information.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DISCUSSION </SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Sexual Behavior. </STRONG>The government alleged Applicant should be disqualified from holding a security clearance because he had inappropriate sexual contact with his then five-year-old daughter in June 
2000 (SOR &para; 1.a); and, in May 2001, he was arrested and charged with two felonies - first degree sexual assault and risk of injury to a minor - which were dismissed nearly two years later because 
Applicant's ex-wife refused to cooperate with prosecutors (SOR &para; 1.b). As to SOR &para; 1.b, the government presented sufficient information to show Applicant was charged as alleged and that the charges 
were later dismissed. Regarding SOR &para; 1.a, the government's information does not show Applicant acted inappropriately with his daughter. In support of this allegation, the government presented, in 
part, documents<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> containing hearsay that are admissible in DOHA proceedings because they fall within exceptions to the rules against hearsay in the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE).<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> 
Notwithstanding the fact these documents are admissible, they contain only summaries of findings and interviews by police investigators and no firsthand observations by the reporting official. The lab 
and medical examination results therein are inconclusive. The documents contain hearsay in the form of a statement by the child's mother, and hearsay within hearsay in the form of a caseworker's 
summary of her interview with the child. As such, I do not assign these documents much weight in deciding if Applicant acted as alleged.</P> 
 
<P>The government relies also on Applicant's statements to NCIS.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> These statements also lack persuasive value. The first two do not show any inappropriate conduct by Applicant and the third was 
drafted by the NCIS agent for Applicant's signature based on the civilian police information the NCIS agent reviewed in preparation for his interviews with Applicant. It is not surprising, under the 
circumstances, that Applicant agreed to sign it rather than continue with the interviews. It is also not surprising that the civilian prosecutor decided he needed the victim's testimony in addition to 
Applicant's March 21 statement to proceed with a case against Applicant. While the absence of a conviction does not preclude the government from presenting information to try to show the conduct 
occurred as alleged, the fact Applicant was arrested, without more, does not equate to proof he engaged in the conduct alleged.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Based on all of the foregoing, I conclude the government failed to show 
Applicant sexually assaulted or "had intentional inappropriate Sexual (sic) contact" with his daughter. Even were I to find otherwise, such conduct would be easily mitigated in that it was isolated, 
occurred several years ago, there is no indication of similar conduct since then, and it cannot serve as a basis for pressure, blackmail, or coercion. I conclude Guideline D for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct. </STRONG>The government alleged Applicant should be disqualified from holding a security clearance because he deliberately falsified his statement to NCIS on March 1, 2001, in which he 
denied sexually assaulting or physically abusing his daughter in June 2000 (SOR &para; 2.a); he deliberately falsified his statement to NCIS on March 20, 2001, when he stated any inappropriate sexual 
contact with his daughter in June 2000 was accidental (SOR &para; 2.b); he deliberately falsified his March 2003 SF 86 by failing to disclose the fact he had been arrested and charged with a felony in 
connection with the alleged misconduct with his daughter (SOR &para; 2.c); he deliberately falsified his March 2003 SF 86 by failing to disclose the fact his car was repossessed in August 2002 (SOR &para; 2.d); 
he deliberately falsified his March 2003 SF 86 by failing to list three debts more as than 180 days past due (SOR &para; 2.e) or as 90 days past due (SOR &para; 2.f); and he deliberately falsified his February 2004 
statement to a government investigator during his background investigation when he again denied sexually assaulting his daughter in June 2000 (SOR &para; 2.g).</P> 
 
<P>As discussed above under Guideline D, the record does not support the allegations that Applicant had inappropriate sexual contact with his daughter as alleged in SOR &para; 1. Accordingly, there is no basis 
to find he intentionally lied about that conduct as alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.a, 2.b, and 2.g. As to the omission of his debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.e and 2.f, Applicant did not know of all the alleged 
delinquencies when he completed the SF 86. </P> 
 
<P>As for the allegations Applicant deliberately withheld relevant information from his SF 86, the totality of information available on these issues shows Applicant acted with the intent required for his 
omissions of the felony charges and automobile repossession to be disqualifying. Regarding SOR &para; 2.c, Applicant was aware at all times of the nature of the charges which resulted from his wife's 
accusations. He had worked closely with an attorney after he was arrested, and there is no indication he thought the charges were misdemeanors rather than felonies. Applicant claims he failed to list the 
charges on his SF 86 because he rushed through the form and mistakenly thought he only to list the charge if he was convicted of it. Yet the charges were dismissed less than a month before Applicant 
filled out the SF 86. It is untenable Applicant did not think the government would expect him to disclose this matter.</P> 
 
<P>In response to the SOR &para; 2.d allegation he deliberately omitted a repossession in August 2002, Applicant alternately claimed (1) he did not list it because at the time he submitted the SF 86, he was in 
negotiation with the finance company to settle the debt,<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> and (2) the finance company's action was not a repossession; rather, it was an end-of-lease turn in.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Neither claim is plausible: the former 
implicitly acknowledges the repossession and Applicant's awareness of it, while the latter apparently occurred to Applicant at hearing. Further undermining Applicant's claim is the fact the creditor is an 
automotive finance company and not a leasing company.</P> 
 
<P>These facts raise a security concern about Applicant's candor and trustworthiness addressed in the Directive under Guideline E. Specifically, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN> 
These facts also require consideration of Guideline E disqualifying condition (DC) 2.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN> The only reasonable conclusion to draw from the available information on this issue is that Applicant deliberately 
omitted the information about his repossession and his arrest. By contrast, Applicant has not presented any information to support consideration of any of the applicable mitigating conditions under this 
guideline.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct. </STRONG>The government alleged the Applicant should be disqualified from holding a security clearance because of the sexual assault and risk of injury charges specified in SOR &para; 1.b (SOR 
&para; 3.a); and because he deliberately made false statements to government investigators and NCIS agents, and through his answers to questions in his SF 86, thereby violating federal criminal law as 
expressed in 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 (SOR &para; 3.b). As to the allegation of criminal sexual conduct, as discussed under Guideline D, above, I conclude the record does not support this allegation and SOR &para; 3.a 
is resolved for the Applicant. Likewise, the allegation in SOR &para; 3.b that he made false statements about the alleged conduct with his daughter is not supported by the government's information.</P> 
 
<P>However, as to the allegation of criminal conduct through deliberate falsifications of his answers in the SF 86, I conclude the government presented sufficient information to support SOR &para; 3.b. As noted 
under Guideline E, above, Applicant knew he had been charged with two felonies, information he was required to disclose regardless of the ultimate legal outcome. He also knew his car had been 
repossessed and that he was required to disclose that fact when he completed his SF 86. Applicant signed his SF 86 directly under an advisement that knowingly making a false statement to the 
government was a violation of criminal law under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. </P> 
 
<P>These facts raise a security concern addressed in the Directive through Guideline J; that is, a person who is willing to disregard the law <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to disregard 
rules and regulations governing the protection of classified information.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN> The criminal activity at issue may consist of a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, the government's 
information proves these allegations and requires consideration of Guideline J DC </SPAN>1 and DC 2.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN> By contrast, Applicant has offered little information to support consideration of any of the Guideline J 
mitigating conditions that might apply to these facts. His criminal conduct is recent and not isolated, in that it consists of multiple false answers submitted during his most recent background 
investigation.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations. </STRONG>The government alleged Applicant should be disqualified from holding a security clearance because he owed over $12,000 after his car was repossessed in 2002, and he 
owed about $660 for three other unpaid debts (SOR &para; 4.a). The government presented sufficient information to support this allegation, thus raising a security concern about Applicant's finances. An 
applicant who is financially overextended through delinquent debt and poor personal financial management may be at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to resolve their fiscal 
difficulties.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> These facts further require consideration of Guideline F disqualifying condition (DC) 1 and DC 3.<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>However, the circumstances surrounding the debts also require consideration of Guideline F mitigating condition MC 1 and MC 3,<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN> because the remaining debts may be attributable not to Applicant 
but to his ex-wife as a result of their divorce. Also, these debts were incurred several years ago and there is no indication Applicant's finances are a continuing problem. Further, Applicant is entitled to 
consideration through MC 6,<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN> in that he settled the repossession debt in 2004. Applicant has mitigated the government's security concerns about his finances.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Concept. </STRONG>A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-10796.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> of available information about Applicant's personal and criminal conduct, taken in the context of the record as a whole, shows that 
reasonable doubts persist about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its 
interests. Applicant decided to withhold from the government information needed to fully and accurately assess his suitability to hold a clearance. He was not an immature adult or adolescent when he 
made that decision, and there is no indication he was unable to read and digest the questions put to him in the questionnaire. Available information raised reasonable doubts about Applicant's 
trustworthiness and candor in this regard. Absent substantial information to mitigate these concerns, which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude he has carried his burden of persuasion in 
response to the government's case.</P>
