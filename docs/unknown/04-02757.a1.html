<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On November 5, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 30, 2005, after the 
hearing,  Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; 
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law,<A HREF="04-02757.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and whether the Appeal Board should grant Applicant a clearance with a warning.   Department Counsel raised the following issue on cross-appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's denial of the government's motion to amend the SOR was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised under Guideline B had been mitigated, as a matter of 
law, under the Guideline B Mitigating Conditions  and the "whole person" concept.  Applicant also argues that the Judge's adverse clearance decision should be 
reversed because the Judge made several errors with respect to his findings.  In support of his arguments, Applicant cites to Hearing Office decisions in which 
applicants with ostensibly similar cases were granted clearances.  He also presents new evidence in the form of statements that his wife is no longer employed at 
the Italian Embassy and no longer possesses an Italian security clearance.  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Board may not consider Applicant's new evidence on appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.29.  And its submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the 
Administrative Judge.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The decisions in other DOHA Hearing Office cases cited by Applicant on appeal do not demonstrate error by the Administrative Judge in this case.  A decision 
by a Hearing Office Judge is not legally binding precedent on that Judge's colleagues in other cases, even if Applicant establishes close factual similarities 
between the cited cases and the instant case.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-23776 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 13, 2006).  Likewise, the cited cases are not legally binding 
precedent on the Board.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ISCR Case No. 01-22606 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jun. 30, 2003).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The findings which Applicant challenges are either permissible characterizations by the Administrative Judge or harmless error, in that they would not be 
reasonably likely to change the outcome of the case.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Administrative Judge's material findings with 
respect Applicant's circumstances of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  The Board does not review 
a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's material findings of security concern are sustainable.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An 
applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and 
circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and "whole person" factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant 
with respect to the Guideline F allegations.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not fully applying any mitigating conditions or favorably applying the 
"whole person" factors with respect the Guideline B allegations, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation 
was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision 
under Guidelines B is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant's request that he be issued a clearance with a warning under Directive &para; E2.2.6 is not reasonable given the facts of this case.  The Administrative 
Judge found and the record evidence supports that, as of the close of the record, Applicant's wife is employed by the Italian Embassy and has an Italian security 
clearance.  Applicant's circumstances do not fit those described in Directive &para; E2.2.6 ("If after evaluating information of security concern, the adjudicator 
decides that the information is not serious enough to warrant a recommendation of disapproval or revocation of the security clearance, it may be appropriate to 
recommend approval with a warning that future incidents of a similar nature may result in revocation of access").</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(3) At the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence by adding new allegations under Guidelines E and J.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> 
Directive E3.1.17.  Although Applicant did not object to this amendment, the Administrative Judge denied the motion noting that he could consider the 
evidence supporting such an amendment in assessing Applicant's credibility, that he had concerns about the sufficiency of notice to the Applicant, and that the 
amendment would create a situation where it would be necessary to take new evidence on the new allegations in a hearing that had already been lengthy.  
Department Counsel argues that it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to deny Department Counsel's motion, a circumstance which denied the 
government due process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the record at the time of Department Counsel's motion, it would have been proper to amend the SOR to included the allegations sought by the 
Department Counsel.  However, because the Administrative Judge's failure to do so was not outcome determinative, such failure was ultimately harmless.</SPAN></P>
