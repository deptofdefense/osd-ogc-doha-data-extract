<P>Applicant is a 70-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He has worked for defense contractors and held a security clearance for 43 years.  Applicant's 
daughter and  granddaughter are dual-citizens of Israel and the U.S., living in Israel.  Applicant's daughter is divorced and has primary custody of her child.  
However, an order of an Israeli court prevents Applicant's daughter from taking her child out of Israel for more than 30 days each year; violation of the court 
order could result in forfeiture of a $15,000.00 bond and loss of custody of the child.  Considering the foreign power in question, the circumstances of the 
family members, and the extent of Applicant's familial, financial, and patriotic ties to the United States, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising 
from the potential foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On February 22, 2002, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  Under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive"), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.  On August 29, 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges 
security concerns raised under Guideline B of the Directive, Foreign Influence.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 30, 2003.  On October 28, 2003, he elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
 
<P>The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge, but was reassigned to me on August 11, 2004.  With the concurrence of the parties, I 
conducted the hearing on September 14, 2004.  At the hearing, I granted the government's motion to amend the SOR, &para;&para; 1.b and1.c, from "son-in-law" to 
"former son-in-law," without objection.  Tr. at 65-66.  The government presented five exhibits.  Applicant presented seven exhibits, called one witness, and 
testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript on September 29, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength 
of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, 
and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a 
clearance.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guideline at issue in this 
case is: </P> 
 
<P>Guideline B, Foreign Influence. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive, it may be disqualifying where, "[<EM>a</EM>]<EM>n</EM> <EM>immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>."  Applicant's daughter is an immediate family member (<EM>See</EM> Directive, &para; 
E2.A2.1.3.1), and his granddaughter is a person with whom Applicant has close ties of obligation or affection.  His daughter and granddaughter reside in Israel, 
and are dual-citizens of Israel and the United States.  The Government's documentary matters and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of this 
disqualifying condition, raising security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, these security concerns can be mitigated in certain circumstances.  Under &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where the 
individuals in question "<EM>are not agents of a foreign power</EM>" or are not "<EM>in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual 
to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.</EM>"</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's daughter and granddaughter are not agents of a foreign power.  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b).  Applicant's former son-in-law is a reserve officer in the 
Israeli Army, but there is no evidence indicating he engages in clandestine intelligence gathering activities.  In any event, he is no longer a member of 
Applicant's immediate family, nor does Applicant have close ties of affection or obligation to him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In assessing whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation by a foreign power, it is necessary to consider several factors, including the character of the 
government of the foreign country concerned.  Israel is a parliamentary democracy (Ex. 5), whose interests are not inimical to those of the United States.  
Indeed, the United States and Israel enjoy close economic and political ties.  Residents and U.S. visitors are subject to strict security requirements, but there is 
no history indicating Israel uses force or coercion against its citizens or U.S. visitors for intelligence purposes.  Ex. 5.  Israel has, in the past, been an active 
collector of intelligence information.  Ex. 4.  However, it is not likely that Israel would attempt to force or coerce its citizens to act adversely to the interests of 
the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is also important to consider the vulnerability of Applicant's relatives in Israel.  Applicant's daughter is a teacher, employed by the Israeli Ministry of 
Education.  Thus, she has some ties to the Israeli government, but not those branches normally involved in intelligence collection activities.  Applicant's 
daughter and granddaughter are also citizens of the United States, and would be free to enter the United States at any time if desired.  Applicant's daughter is 
especially vulnerable in one respect: an order from an Israeli court prevents Applicant's granddaughter from leaving Israel for more than 30 days each year, and 
the order is enforced by the requirement of a $15,000.00 bond.  Applicant's daughter would like to return to the United States permanently, but is constrained 
from doing so because she will not leave her daughter in Israel.  At the same time, Applicant's daughter has lived in Israel since about 1986, and there have 
been no attempts to exert pressure on Applicant through his daughter.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or coercion.  Undoubtedly, Applicant and his wife are devoted to their daughter and 
granddaughter in Israel.  At the same time, he has extensive familial ties to the United States; all the rest of his family members are citizens of the United States 
and reside in this country.  He also has substantial financial interests in this country, including real estate, retirement funds, and bank accounts.  His foreign 
financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect his security responsibilities.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3.5.  Applicant has been a loyal soldier and 
defense contractor employee for 43 years.  Applicant testified that every year they have a security clearance briefing and take an oath to guard the classified 
materials in their possession, and that he takes that obligation very seriously.  Tr. at 27.  He also stated that if anyone ever attempted to use his daughter or 
granddaughter to apply pressure on him to compromise security, he would go directly to the FBI.  <EM>Id.  </EM>I find Applicant to be very credible and sincere in this 
regard.  Considering all the circumstances, I find Applicant is not unusually vulnerable to coercion or duress as a result of having family members residing in 
Israel.  I conclude the mitigating condition set out in &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive applies in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude any potential security concerns arising from Applicant's relatives residing 
in Israel are mitigated by Applicant's extensive ties to and interests in the United States.  </SPAN></P>
