  Although a criminal indictment, standing alone, may not be sufficient to constitute proof of the conduct alleged therein, it does not follow that a criminal indictment has no probative value in DOHA proceedings.  Whether the concept of imputed knowledge can be appropriately applied in any given case  will depend on the particular facts of the case.  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance is not reducible to a simple formula, but  rather requires an adjudicator to exercise sound judgment within the parameters set by the Directive.  Maintaining public confidence in the industrial security  program can be a factor in making a clearance decision.  The Board need not agree with the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions to decide that  Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Favorable decision affirmed.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A brief summary of the factual background of this case will be useful to provide a context for the discussion of issues raised by the parties on appeal.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was secretary-treasurer and comptroller of a publicly-traded company ("Company A") that performed work on classified defense contracts.  In 
November 1993, a grand jury indicted Company A, Applicant, and other named individuals on various counts of conspiracy to defraud the federal government, 
fraud against the federal government, and making false statements to the federal government.  A superseding indictment was issued in April 1994 to add an 
additional count.<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1993, Company A was suspended from doing business on government contracts.  Applicant's security clearance was suspended in March 1994.  
The suspension of Company A was upheld by a federal district court and a federal court of appeals.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following issuance of the indictment, a civil suit was filed by the federal government, seeking recovery from Company A, Applicant, and other named 
defendants for alleged submission of false claims on government contracts concerning a classified program.  Two other civil actions were submitted against 
Company A and other named defendants for claims relating to the criminal indictments.  Applicant was named as a defendant in only one of the two civil 
actions brought by nongovernment plaintiffs.  Applicant later was dismissed as a named defendant of that civil suit based on lack of personal jurisdiction and 
insufficient service of process.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1998, a plea agreement was entered into.  Under the plea agreement, Company A pleaded guilty to one felony count of violating 18 U.S.C. 1001.  
Applicant did not enter a guilty plea to the indictment and the criminal charges against him were dropped as part of the plea agreement.  As part of the plea 
agreement, Company A was fined $400,000, assessed a statutory penalty of $200, required to reimburse the federal government $1.1 million for its 
investigation costs, and pay $6,500,000 to settle the civil actions that had been brought against Company A.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1</SPAN>.  Department Counsel contends the Administrative Judge 
erred by applying Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> because the adverse information presented by Department Counsel during the proceedings below 
was substantiated, and the adverse information was clearly pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.  In support of this 
contention, Department Counsel makes several, interrelated arguments:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(a) the Judge improperly applied the preponderance of the evidence standard;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(b) the criminal indictment was admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(c) Applicant admitted to the conduct referenced in the indictment, except to the extent of denying that the conduct was improper, criminal, or of security 
significance;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(d) the criminal indictment proves there was probable cause that Applicant engaged in the acts alleged in the indictment;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(e) the criminal indictment contains evidentiary findings with respect to acts by Applicant that demonstrate poor judgment, lack of candor, or unreliability;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(f) Applicant made general denials and, except for conduct referenced in Count 10 of the superseding indictment, failed to specifically or coherently deny or 
explain the occurrence of acts on his part that were found in the indictment;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(g) Company A, which was named as a defendant in the indictment, agreed to plead guilty and pay approximately $8 million in fines, civil settlements, and 
costs; and "Corporations do not pay out that kind of money to settle 'unsubstantiated' allegations";</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(h) the guilty plea by Company A is evidence of Applicant's culpability because the guilty plea of a co-conspirator has some probative value;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(i) the Air Force specifically found the alleged misconduct of the company was imputed to Applicant and other officers of the company; and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(j) the fact that the federal government resumed contracting with Company A "did not in any way rebut, refute or mitigated (sic) the Government's case against 
Applicant"; rehabilitation of Company A does not prove Applicant has been rehabilitated.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Department Counsel's arguments fail to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel correctly notes that the preponderance of the evidence standard does not apply in DOHA proceedings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 
(December 27, 1999) at p. 2.  However, our review of the Administrative Judge's decision in its entirety persuades us that the Judge did not apply the 
preponderance of the evidence standard in making his findings of fact.  Department Counsel's contention to the contrary lacks merit.</P> 
 
<P>In DOHA proceedings, strict rules of evidence do not apply, and technical rules of evidence may be relaxed to permit the development of a full and complete 
record.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.19.  Furthermore, hearsay evidence is admissible in these proceedings and can be relied on 
by an Administrative Judge in making findings of fact.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0265 (March 17, 1999) at p. 7.  The Appeal Board decision relied on by 
Department Counsel to support its contention that the criminal indictment is admissible is factually distinguishable.  In any event, Department Counsel's 
admissibility argument is misplaced because the Judge admitted the criminal indictment into the record evidence.  The admission of the criminal indictment 
into the record evidence did not require the Judge to give any particular weight to it.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel's argument concerning Applicant's admissions in the answer to the SOR is not well taken.  Applicant correctly notes that the admissions 
in the answer to the SOR are very limited and narrow in their nature and scope.  It is untenable for Department Counsel to assert that Applicant's answer to the 
SOR contains admissions that he engaged in the conduct referenced in the criminal indictment.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant correctly notes that the Board has held that an indictment is not proof of the criminal conduct alleged therein.  Consideration of this case leads the 
Board to qualify that prior holding for two reasons.  First, Department Counsel correctly notes that an indictment is evidence that the grand jury made a finding 
that there is probable cause that the named defendant(s) engaged in the conduct alleged in the indictment.  As such, a grand jury indictment is distinguishable 
from the allegations in a complaint made by a party to a lawsuit.  Second, there is an important distinction between evidence that has probative value and 
evidence that constitutes proof of a controverted fact.  Individual pieces of evidence may have probative value even if the individual pieces, standing alone, are 
not sufficient to prove a controverted fact.<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Accordingly, although a criminal indictment, standing alone, may not be sufficient to constitute proof of the 
conduct alleged therein, it does not follow that a criminal indictment has no probative value in these proceedings.  However, as the trier of fact, an 
Administrative Judge is not bound by the probable cause finding made by a grand jury.  Such a probable cause finding is evidence that a Judge must consider in 
light of the record as a whole in making findings of fact and drawing reasonable inferences from the record evidence.  In this case, the Judge did not ignore the 
indictment.  Rather, the Judge considered the indictment in his evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, including the evidence that the indictment had 
been dismissed.<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel's disagreement with the weight that the Judge gave to the dismissed indictment is not sufficient to demonstrate the 
Judge committed error.</P> 
 
<P>The general nature of Applicant's denials does not have the significance Department Counsel seeks to attribute to them.  Department Counsel is required to 
present evidence to prove controverted facts.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.14.  Department Counsel's burden of proving controverted 
facts does not turn on whether an applicant's denials are general or specific.  An Administrative Judge has the discretion to draw reasonable inferences and 
conclusions about the applicant's credibility based on the Judge's consideration of the applicant's denials (whether they are general or specific in nature) in light 
of the record evidence as a whole.<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  For all these reasons, the Board declines to rule that the general nature of an applicant's denials, standing alone, requires a 
Judge to reach any particular conclusion about the applicant's credibility or make any particular finding of fact in a case.</P> 
 
<P>Under the relaxed rules of evidence that apply to DOHA proceedings and the substantial evidence standard, the record evidence of the facts and circumstances 
surrounding Company A's guilty plea and settlement of the civil claims could be considered by the Administrative Judge when he weighed the record evidence 
in this case.  However, Department Counsel's argument about the significance of Company A's guilty plea and settlement of the civil claims does not 
demonstrate the Judge acted in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  A reading of the decision shows the Judge considered the evidence 
concerning Company A's guilty plea and its settlement of the civil claims.  Department Counsel's disagreement with the weight that the Judge placed on that 
evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed it in an arbitrary or capricious manner.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel also contends that the Air Force specifically found the alleged misconduct of Company A was imputed to Applicant and other officers of 
the company.  Department Counsel appears to be referring to an Air Force memorandum concerning the suspension of the Company A.  It is not clear whether 
the author of that memorandum made a specific finding of fact about Applicant and other officers of the company, or was relying on a presumption that the 
conduct of Company A should be imputed to them.<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  As the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge had to decide how much weight to give to the Air Force 
memorandum.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Board is not persuaded that Department Counsel's argument on this point demonstrates the 
Judge acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner with respect to weighing the Air Force memorandum.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel persuasively argues that the kind of conduct covered by the indictment is relevant and material to evaluating an applicant's security 
eligibility.  If the Administrative Judge had found that Applicant had engaged in the conduct alleged in the criminal indictment, then such conduct clearly would 
be pertinent to a determination about Applicant's judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  However, the Judge did not make such a finding.  Given the 
Judge's particular findings in this case, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude the allegations against Applicant were unsubstantiated for 
purposes of applying Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel persuasively argues that evidence of rehabilitation of Company A does not constitute evidence of rehabilitation of Applicant.  However, 
our reading of the decision below persuades us that the Administrative Judge relied on the rehabilitation of Company A for the limited purpose of concluding 
that Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 7<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> could be applied in favor of Applicant.  Accordingly, Department Counsel has not shown the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision should be reversed</SPAN>. Department Counsel's the Administrative Judge's decision should be reversed because: (a) 
Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition1 is the only mitigating condition which could overcome the Government's case under Personal Conduct Disqualifying 
Condition 1; and (b) the Judge's application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 7 would be insufficient to warrant a favorable decision because its plain 
language is worded to overcome Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6, not Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 1.</P> 
 
<P>(a) As discussed earlier in this decision, Department Counsel has failed to demonstrated the Administrative Judge acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner by 
applying Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.  Furthermore, the Board is not persuaded by Department Counsel's argument that Personal Conduct 
itigating Condition 1 is the only mitigating condition which could overcome the Government's case under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 1.  The 
Board recently addressed a similar argument in another case.  In that case the Board stated the following:</P> 
 
<P>"[N]othing in the Adjudicative Guidelines specifies how an adjudicator is to decide what mitigating conditions may be applied in a given case to mitigate the 
negative security implications of disqualifying conditions applicable to the facts and circumstances of an applicant's case.  However, the absence of such a 
specific rule does not leave an adjudicator unfettered discretion in applying the Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance.  Rather, an adjudicator must:</P> 
 
<P>(a) evaluate the possible applicability of disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines according to their plain meaning;</P> 
 
<P>(b) assess the applicability of particular disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines in terms of other relevant 
provisions of the Directive;</P> 
 
<P>(c) apply provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines in a manner that is consistent with the adjudicator's obligation to render an overall commonsense decision 
based on consideration of an applicant's security eligibility under the whole person concept; and</P> 
 
<P>(d) construe and apply provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines in a manner consonant with the "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard.</P> 
 
<P>Accordingly, the application of Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance is not reducible to a simple formula, but rather requires an adjudicator to 
exercise sound judgment within the parameters set by the Directive when deciding which Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance are applicable to a 
given case."  ISCR Case No. 01-20906 (January 10, 2003) at pp. 6-7 (footnotes omitted)</P> 
 
<P>The same reasoning is applicable to Department Counsel's argument in this case.  Furthermore, Department Counsel's argument runs afoul of prior Board 
decisions which make it clear that the application <EM>vel non</EM> of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating conditions is not solely dispositive of a case.  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0484 (February 1, 2002) at p. 6.</P> 
 
<P>(b) Department Counsel also argues the Administrative Judge's application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 7<A HREF="01-12429.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> would be insufficient to warrant a 
favorable decision because its plain language is worded to overcome Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 6, not Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 
1.  As discussed in the preceding paragraph, application of Adjudicative Guidelines for or against clearance is not reducible to a simple formula.  Given the 
record evidence in this case, the Judge's application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 7 was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>The Board need not agree with the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions in order to decide that Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate the 
Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>
