<P>Applicant failed to mitigate foreign influence concerns raised by members of his immediate family who live, spend considerable time in, or are residents of 
Iran.  And I am prohibited from granting him a clearance because he possesses a foreign passport.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 14 January 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-26232.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 5 February 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case 
was assigned to me on 20 May 2004.  On 22 June 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 1 July 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>During the hearing, to conform the SOR to the evidence, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as follows:</P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make 
decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">You possess an Iranian passport and used it to travel to Iran.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had no objection and the SOR was so amended.  I required Department Counsel to provide Applicant a copy of the "Money Memo"<A HREF="02-26232.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and kept the 
record open until 12 July for him to provide any additional materials to mitigate the allegations.  He provided a letter from the president of the company that 
employs him (Ex. A), a letter from Applicant (Ex. B), and a copy of his state driver's license (Ex. C).  Without objection from Department Counsel, I admitted 
the three exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old installation manager for a defense contractor.  Applicant was born and raised in Iran.  In 1986, he left Iran and went to live in India.  
In 1989, he moved to Canada as a Landed Immigrant.  In December 1993 or January 1994, Applicant applied for Canadian citizenship.  On 10 May 1994, he 
entered the U.S. and became a permanent resident.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 1995, Applicant attempted to enter Canada as a returning Canadian resident.  At the border, he was denied entry to Canada when it was determined 
he was both a Landed Immigrant in Canada and a permanent resident alien in the U.S.  He was returned to the U.S. and subsequently served with an Order to 
Show Cause in Deportation Proceedings charging him with fraud in obtaining his Immigrant Visa in that he had no intention of living in the U.S.  His alien 
registration card was confiscated.  Applicant reapplied for admission into Canada and was admitted.  He became a Canadian citizen on 15 January 1995.  On 2 
arch 1995, Applicant returned to U.S. from Canada as a non-immigrant visitor by presenting his Canadian citizenship card as identification.  Ex. 3 at 11.  
Subsequently, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on 26 October 2001.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 1.  He does not have a U.S. passport.  Ex. 1 at 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents immigrated to the U.S. in 1985.  They are permanent U.S. residents.  Applicant does not expect them to become U.S. citizens because they 
do not speak English well.  They have been in Iran the last couple months caring for Applicant's ill grandmother.  Tr. 15-16.  They normally travel to Iran once 
a year and stay for various periods up to nine months.  Tr. 16.  They own a house in Iran.  When they are in the U.S. they normally stay with one of their sons. 
Recently, Applicant obtained an Iranian passport so he could go visit his ill grandmother.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All of Applicant's siblings reside in the U.S., except his sister, who lives in Iran.  Two of his brothers are also U.S. citizens.  Answer.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed his security clearance application on 12 March 2002.  Question 9 required him to list his relatives and associates.  Applicant listed his 
mother and father, but not his sister and three brothers.  Question 26 required Applicant if, in the previous seven years, he had been arrested, charged, or 
convicted of any offenses not listed in previous questions.  Applicant answered no and did not list being charged with an immigration violation in March 1995.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B--Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's parents are citizens of Iran (&para; 1.a); they travel to Iran often (&para; 1.b); they own a house in Iran (&para; 1.c); Applicant's sister is 
a citizen resident of Iran (&para; 1.d); he contacts his sister by telephone once or twice a year (&para; 1.e); two of Applicant's brothers are citizens of Iran (&para; 1.f); and 
Applicant has weekly contact with those two brother (&para; 1.g).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may 
be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions all or portions of each of the allegations in the SOR, except &para;&para; 1.c.  Members 
of Applicant's immediate family are citizens or residents of a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  His parents spend considerable amount of time each year at 
their home in Iran and Applicant stays in touch with his parents and siblings, as one would expect.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a mitigating condition if the immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the applicant to choose between loyalty to the family members and loyalty to the U.S.  Although Applicant's family members are not 
agents of a foreign power, his parents and sister are in a vulnerable position living or staying for long periods in Iran.  The U.S. Government does not have 
diplomatic relations with Iran and recent tensions have "increased the potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests abroad posed by those who oppose U.S. 
policy."  Ex. 5.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E--Personal Conduct </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately omitting the names of his sibling (&para; 2.a) and his being charged with an immigration 
violation (&para; 2.b).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA his lien, his unpaid judgments, his repossessions, and 
delinquent debts. Proof Applicant omitted this information from his SCA shifted the burden to Applicant to explain the omissions sufficiently to negate a 
finding of knowing and deliberate falsification.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After carefully listening and observing Applicant, I am satisfied that he did not deliberately falsify his SCA.  There was no secret that he had a sister in Iran and 
brothers who were in the U.S. but still Iranian citizens.  He just considered his parents as the immediate or primary members of his family.  Likewise, I am 
convinced Applicant did not believe he was charged with a criminal offense.  The evidence strongly suggests that, because he went before an immigration 
judge, only a civil offense was involved.  I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B--Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As amended, the SOR alleges Applicant possesses a foreign passport.  &para; 3.a.  When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign 
country over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence established Applicant has an Iranian passport.  The possession and use of a foreign passport is a disqualifying condition.  DC E2.A3.1.2.2.  The 
use of the foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen is an exercise of dual citizenship.  DC  E2.A3.1.2.1.  It is a mitigating condition for an applicant to 
express a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  MC E2.A3.1.3.4.  Nevertheless, a clearance must "be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the 
foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."  Memo. from Arthur L. Money, Asst 
Sec. Def. Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, to Directors of Defense Agencies, <EM>Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) 
Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline</EM> (Aug. 16, 2000).  I afforded Applicant 20 days in which he could take action to 
surrender his Iranian passport.  He provided no evidence that he had done so.  Accordingly, I find against Applicant on &para; 3.</SPAN></P>
