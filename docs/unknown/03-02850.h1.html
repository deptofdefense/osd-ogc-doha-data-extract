<P>Applicant is a logistics specialist for a defense contractor.   She accumulated delinquent debts starting in 1994, including two debts related to car repossessions.  
After submitting a security clearance application and being interviewed by security investigators, Applicant started to pay some of her delinquent debts.  The 
day after receiving the SOR, Applicant used her savings and money borrowed from her mother to pay off almost all her small delinquent debts but did not 
satisfy her larger debts.  Applicant did not initiate a good-faith effort to pay past due creditors or satisfy debt.  She deliberately did not include a car 
repossession on her security clearance application.  Applicant did not mitigate security concerns under Guidelines F and E.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 19, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 24, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 13, 2004.  She fully admitted five allegations, fully denied four allegations, and admitted part and denied 
part of 19 allegations under Guidelines F.  She denied the allegation under Guideline E.  She requested a hearing before an administrative judge and the request 
was received by DOHA on September 15, 2004.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on March 2, 2005, and the case was assigned to 
me on March 15, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 7, 2005, and the hearing convened on April 25, 2005.  Ten government exhibits, eleven 
Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of the Applicant were received during the hearing.  The transcript was received on May 5, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

periods of unemployment between jobs.  There were also short periods of sickness when she did not work and did not receive her full salary.  She is married 
with two children who are no longer at home.  Applicant received her bachelor's degree in 2004 after attending college part-time.<A HREF="03-02850.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant presented letters

has not paid the debt and will let it lapse so it will be removed from her credit report.<A HREF="03-02850.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

only her husband drove.  Applicant and her husband contacted the creditor in August 2004 to determine a process for paying off the debt.  There is no

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each

and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a

voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="03-02850.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree

necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-02850.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-02850.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-02850.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in 
one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P> 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty<EM>, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Applicant's delinquent debts starting in 1994 brings the matter within Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Conditions Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.2 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts</EM>).  Applicant has been accumulating delinquent debt since 1994.  Some of these debts were small and some were large debts, such as the remainder 
from car repossessions.  Applicant made no effort to pay the debts, even the small ones, until she started the security clearance process and received the SOR in 
August 2004.  Applicant's debts and history of not paying her financial obligations until recently shows a history of not meeting financial obligations and an 
unwillingness or inability to satisfy debts.  I conclude the above disqualifying conditions have been established.</P> 
<P>Applicant's debts, starting in 1994, ranged from unpaid medical bills to car repossessions.  Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions Directive 
E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>), and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>it is an isolated incident</EM>) do not apply because of the long term nature and diversity of 
Applicant's delinquent debts.  Applicant raised the issue that she had medical problems at times that occasionally prevented her from working a full schedule 
affecting her pay.  However, she did not present any information about income lost to the extent of raising Financial Consideration Mitigating Condition 
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, . . . unexpected medical 
emergency; ; ; )</EM>).  Further, she failed to show she could not have resolved the debts after they arose.  I conclude Applicant did not establish conditions beyond 
her control that affected her ability to meet financial obligations.  I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  Applicant submitted her first security clearance application in 
1999 and another in March 2002.  She was interviewed by a Defense Security Service agent on October 31, 2002.  Applicant paid some of her delinquent debts 
in April 2003.  Applicant received the SOR on August 2004 and paid a majority of her delinquent debts on August 25, 2004.  She paid these debts using 
resources from her saving account and borrowing money from her mother.  Applicant did not attempt to pay delinquent debts until confronted with the potential 
her delinquent debts would adversely affect a security clearance determination.  She had savings and access to funds to pay her debts but chose not to do so 
until confronted with the adverse security clearance determination.  There was no effort by Applicant to resolve the debts over the extended time there was debt.  
This is not a good faith effort to pay overdue creditors or other wise satisfy debts.  Applicant has not mitigated security concerns for the debts she paid after the 
start of the security clearance process.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Applicant's failure to list the car repossession in 1999 brings the matter under Personal Conduct 
Disqualifying Condition Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal 
security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness</EM>).  Applicant stated she did not list the repossession because she thought the debt was solely her husband's debt.  However, she did sign the loan 
for the vehicle and she had to appear in court in an action brought by the creditor.  When she completed the security clearance applications less than two years 
later, she had to know she was a debtor on the repossession of the vehicle.  I conclude Applicant deliberately omitted the 1999 repossession from her security 
clearance application.</P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P>
