<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran.  Applicant was born in the U.S.  Applicant's  immediate family are Iranian citizens.  His father lives in the 
United Arab Emirates (UAE), and his mother divides her time between the U.S. and the UAE.  Applicant's grandmothers are citizens of Iran and resident there.  
Applicant obtained an Iranian passport in 1998 and used it twice to travel to the UAE and Iran.  Applicant has not surrendered the Iranian passport, even though 
it expired in 2003. Applicant did not mitigate the foreign preference or the foreign influence security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG>  </P> 
 
<P>On February 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
under the personnel security Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The SOR recommended 
referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a signed and sworn statement, dated March 9, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  On August 16, 2004, Department Counsel submitted the 
Department's written case.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="03-13363.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to the Applicant.  He was given  the opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant did not file a response to the FORM within the scheduled due date of 
September 27, 2004.  The case was assigned to me on October 12, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 27 years old and was born in the United States to Iranian parents who were studying in the U.S.  Applicant has U.S. citizenship.  At the age of five 
(1982), he moved to Iran.  His parents later moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  In 1995 Applicant returned to the U.S. to attend college. He is single 
and works for a defense contractor.  Applicant obtained a renewal of his Iranian passport in 1998 and it expired in 2003.  Applicant used the Iranian passport to 
travel to Iran to visit his elderly grandparents, who are citizens of Iran and live there.  Applicant has not surrendered this passport to the appropriate issuing 
authority.  Applicant asserts he will not renew that passport, and is willing to relinquish it.  Applicant also possesses a U.S. passport. (Exhibits 3, 5, and 6)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's mother moved to the U.S. sometime after Applicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) in July 2001.  She travels back and forth to 
the UAE to visit her husband, whose business is located there.  He sells equipment.  Applicant's father may move to the U.S. someday.  Applicant speaks 
telephonically with his father weekly.  Applicant is unaware of his parents' intention regarding applying for U.S. citizenship.  His parents own a home in the 
U.S.   His brother is a college student in the U.S. with a student visa.  Applicant traveled to the UAE in 1999 and Iran in the spring of 2001.  (Exhibits 5 and 6)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Iran and the U.S. have strained diplomatic relations.  The U.S. State Department has issued a travel warning to U.S. citizens contemplating travel to Iran.  The 
U.S. Department of State identified Iran as "the most active state sponsor of international terrorism." Exhibits 7 and 8)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id</EM>. At 527.The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>Section 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1., 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>GUIDELINE C: Foreign Preference</STRONG>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A3 .1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The exercise of dual citizenship.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: E2.A3.1.3. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.4.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B: Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.2.l. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,. daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s,) 
involved and the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.l.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The memorandum dated August 16, 2000, signed by Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur L. Money (Money Memo), is additional guidance regarding "the 
application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport.  The memorandum requires the current possession or use of 
a foreign passport, and that fact may be a disqualifying condition. (Exhibit 9)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering Guideline C, the Government has clearly shown that Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran, and that he has</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> an expired Iranian passport.  
Applicant exercised dual citizenship by renewing the Iran passport and using it to travel to the UAE and Iran.  Even though the Iranian passport has expired, 
Applicant has not surrendered it to the Iranian government. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and DC 2 apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1 and 4 might apply.  Applicant obtained his Iranian citizenship because his parents are Iranian citizens.  However, at the age of 21, 
Applicant renewed that passport on his own initiative and used it to travel to the UAE and Iran, thereby exercising his dual citizenship and in effect reaffirming 
it.  That action is more than merely obtaining the status of Iranian citizenship through a person's parents' citizenship.  Consequently, MC 1 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At present, Applicant stated he would not renew the Iranian passport, but has not surrendered it even though it is expired, as the Money Memo requires.  His 
Iranian passport only expired last year.  Applicant is willing to renounce Iranian citizenship, although he has taken no overt actions to accomplish this expressed 
intent.  The promise of future actions are not sufficient to invoke the MC 4. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Money Memo applies to this situation because Applicant could renew the expired passport and has not surrendered it in accordance with the requirements 
of the Money Memo.  Applicant obtained an Iranian passport while a U.S. citizen, The Money Memo further states "consistent application of te guideline 
requires any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate 
agency of the United States Government."  Applicant submitted no evidence that he surrendered the Iranian passport, even though it expired, or that he had 
official U.S. government approval for the use of the Iranian passport.   Therefore, I conclude Guideline C against Applicant.  ISCR Case No. 01-24306, 
September 30, 2003.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Regarding Guideline B, the applicable</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> DC</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> is DC 1 (close relatives are citizens of a foreign country, or are resident in a foreign country). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant's parents 
are not citizens of the U.S.  His father spends little time in the U.S., and his mother resides here as a resident alien for only part of each year, and the other 
portion of each year she travels to the UAE to visit her husband.  Applicant's grandparents are citizens of and reside in Iran.  His brother is in the U.S. only on a 
student visa, and is a citizen of Iran.  These connections to Iran are close and continuous.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The MC that might apply is MC 1.  The burden is on Applicant to show his relatives are not agents of the Iranian government.  Applicant must also show his 
relatives are not in a position to be exploited by the Iranian government in such a way that Applicant could be forced to choose between the family members 
and his loyalty to the U.S.  Applicant has not met that burden.  His association with the U.S. is really only since 1995 when he returned to attend college.  His 
father is in business in the UAE and could be exploited by the Iranian government.  Applicant's grandparents live in Iran and could be exploited .  Applicant 
traveled to Iran to visit them.  He has affection for them that could place him in a position to choose between his grandparents and his loyalty to the U.S.  
Applicant has not shown his grandparents could not be exploited.  Therefore, I conclude Guideline B against Applicant. </SPAN></P>
