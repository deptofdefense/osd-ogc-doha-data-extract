<P>Applicant incurred over $21,000 in delinquent debt, for which she has no payment plan in place. She has been arrested and charged nine times with the misdemeanor crime of issuance of worthless 
checks. She intentionally falsified one answer on her security clearance application and has a pattern of conduct which reflects rules violation. She has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns 
raised under financial considerations, criminal conduct and personal conduct. Applicant's eligibility for a assignment to a sensitive position is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In August 2003 and again in October 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined 
to grant the application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On July 
10, 2006, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under 
</SPAN>Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</P> 
 
<P>On September 6, 2006 and October 3, 2006, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. She elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant with a complete copy on November 17, 2006. Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She submitted an undated response, which reflects a postmark of December 27, 2006. This case was assigned to me on 
January 11, 2007. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In her SOR response, Applicant admits to all the SOR allegations under Guideline F, Guideline J and Guideline E.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and 
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 39-year-old woman employed as a customer service representative in a position of public trust for a Department of Defense contractor. She has worked for her employer for almost six 
years. She is a high school graduate. She has three children, ages 19, 18, and 17.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> She and the father of her children never married. She receives sporadic support payments from him (the father of 
her children).<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's financial statement, dated March 16, 2005, reflects that her gross monthly income was $2032, and her net monthly income, including child support of $249.00, was $1,798.00. She 
itemized her monthly expenses as $760.00 for rent, $300.00 for groceries, $50.00 for clothing, $346.00 for utilities and telephone, $170.00 for car expenses, and $50.00 for medical for total monthly 
expenses of $1,676.00, leaving $122.00 a month for all other expenses, including repayment of her outstanding debts.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has incurred unpaid debts totaling $15,898.00. More than $11,000.00 of this debt is for medical expenses. In addition, eight creditors have obtained judgments against her, totaling 
$7,160.06.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> She states that two judgments (Allegations w and hh of the SOR) were paid in 2003 through garnishment, but she has not provided documentation to support her statement. She also 
states that the debt listed in Allegation uu is being paid down, since the father of her children obtained medical insurance. She disputes the debt identified in Allegation o, but has not provided any 
documentation showing that she formally disputed this debt. If her statements are true, she has resolved $2,178.25 of her debt, leaving unpaid debt of almost $21,000.00. She has not presented any 
evidence which shows how she intends to repay this debt or that she has established a payment plan for these debts.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In 1994, the police charged Applicant with the crime of issuance of worthless checks. She pled no contest to the charge. The court fined her $338.76, which she has not paid. In 2003, the police 
cited her for the crime of issuance of worthless checks on seven occasions. When she did not pay the fines, the police arrested, charged, and booked her for these crimes. On the July 2, 2003, the 
court found her guilty and fined her $242.00, which has not been paid. The record lacks evidence regarding the disposition of the remaining six charges and documentation of payment, although 
Applicant states that she has paid all the fines, but two. In 2004, the police again charged her with the crime of issuance of worthless checks on one occasion. The disposition of this charge is 
unknown as there is no evidence in the record. These criminal charges are Class A misdemeanor crimes. Wisconsin Statute Annotated &sect; 943.24 (1). Finally, the SOR alleges criminal conduct based 
on its allegation of falsification by her when she completed her SF 85P.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 3, 2003, Applicant completed a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85-P), which she re-executed on October 22, 2004. She answered <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"no" then wrote "unsure" to the following 
question:<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 20.  Your Police Record</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"In the last seven years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses. (leave out fines of less than $150)"</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her response to the SOR, she acknowledges her police record, and states that she does not keep a log of each charge for the last seven years. She provides no other explanation for her answer.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant answered "yes" to the following question about her finances, she only listed only one judgement, when she had eight judgments:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 22. Your Financial Record - a</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"In the last 7 years, have you, or a company over which you exercised some control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or had legal judgment rendered against 
you for debt? If you answered "yes," provide date of initial action and other information requested below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her response, she admits having judgments, but states that she did not keep a record or log of each judgment.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "no" to the following question on her SF 85P:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 22. Your Financial Record - b</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her response to the SOR, she admitted to the allegation, then stated that she did not keep a record or log of each debt she had incurred.<A HREF="06-08410.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Finally, the SOR alleges that Applicant was charged with Operating After Suspension and Failure to Pay in February 2000. The record contains no other evidence regarding this allegation, which 
Applicant admits.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations, 
Guideline J - Criminal Conduct, and Guideline E - Personal Conduct - as to allegations 3.c and 3.d.. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case. Applicant has had difficulty meeting her financial obligations since 1993. Currently, she has more than 50 delinquent debts with an 
approximate unpaid balance of $21,000.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Applicant's delinquent debts remain outstanding. Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not 
recent</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was isolated</EM>) because she more than delinquent debts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a 
death, divorce, or separation)</EM>) does not apply because Applicant has not explained how she incurred all these debts, although it does appear that about $11,000.00 of her unpaid debts are for 
medical bills. She has not provided any information explaining the circumstances which caused her to incur these medical bills.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) does not apply. 
Applicant has not met with or retained the services of a consumer credit counseling nor has she developed any repayment plans for her outstanding debts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is not applicable. While Applicant states that three debts have been paid and she 
disagrees with a fourth debt, she has not made any effort to repay more than 90% of her delinquent debts. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concern. Guideline 
F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Based on the Applicant's admissions, the government has established its case under Guideline J as to allegations 2.a through 2.i. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.2. 
(<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) applies. Applicant has been charged with issuing worthless checks, a Class A misdemeanor, on nine different occasions between 1994 and 2004, 
with 7 charges in 2003. On at least one of the charges, the court found her guilty. In addition, Applicant falsified answer to Questions 22b on her security clearance application, <EM>see</EM> discussion <EM>infra</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>I have consider the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions and conclude that none apply. Applicant's conduct is recent, not isolated, and the result of her decisions. She has provided no evidence 
of successful rehabilitation or acquittal. She has not mitigated the government's concerns. Guideline J is found against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a trustworthiness concern because it asks the central question of whether a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to 
properly safeguard classified and/or sensitive information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when 
applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a trustworthiness concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, Applicant answered "no" then wrote "unsure" in the space for additional information for Question 20 on her public trust application. Her answer indicates that she did not understand 
what specific information the question asked her to provide. Her lack of understanding is not sufficient to establish that she intentional falsified her answer to this question. The government has not 
established its case as to allegation 3.a., which is found in favor of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>When she completed the SF 85P, she answered Question 22a in the affirmative. She, however, only listed one judgment when there were five judgments. She acknowledged these judgments in her 
response, stating that she did not keep a list or log of all the judgments. Given the extensive and varied unpaid debts she has, it is highly probable that she did not have immediate recall on her 
outstanding judgments. I find that she did not deliberately falsify her answer to this question. Allegation 3.b. is found in favor of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>However, regarding allegation 3.c. in the SOR, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies. Applicant admits that she did not acknowledge that she had delinquent debts more than 180 
days over due. Given the numerous debts she has and the length of time many of these debts are overdue, she knew that she had delinquent debts. I find her failure to answer "yes" to this question 
was deliberate.</P> 
 
<P>As to allegation 3.d. of the SOR, Applicant admits the conduct alleged. Based on her admission, PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rules violation, including violation of any written or 
recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM>) applies. Applicant failed to pay the fine imposed, just as she has failed to pay other court fines and her debts. Her conduct 
demonstrates a long pattern of failure to pay legal fines and debts owed.</P> 
 
<P>I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply under personal conduct. Applicant has failed to mitigate the personal conduct concern. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.<STRONG> </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the objective 
of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I have 
considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a long history of non-payment of debt. In conjunction with her failure to pay debt, she has a criminal record for writing bad checks, which is more evidence of her failure to properly 
manage her finances and to pay her bills. She has not been forthright about her finances, despite knowing about her long delinquent debts. Based on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
