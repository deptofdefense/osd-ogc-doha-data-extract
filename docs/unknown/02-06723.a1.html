  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  The ability of an appealing party to formulate an interpretation of the record evidence different from that adopted by the Administrative Judge is insufficient to demonstrate the Judge committed error.  The Judge is responsible for weighing the record evidence,  both favorable and unfavorable.  Absent a showing that the Judge did so in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, the Board will not disturb  the Judge's weighing of the evidence.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline B are sustainable.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 25, 2002 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative 
Judge Martin H. Mogul issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated June 4, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they: (1) are arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has made assertions in his appeal brief that go beyond the record below and constitute new evidence.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on 
appeal.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  The Board will limit its consideration of Applicant's brief to those arguments that are not 
based on new evidence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law</SPAN>.  On appeal Applicant asserts: (a) contrary to 
the conclusion of the Administrative Judge, Applicant does not think he has close contact with his parents, who live in the People's Republic of China; (b) there 
is no chance that a foreign power can use his parents and relatives to make him do things harmful to the United States; and (c) he considers the United States his 
homeland, he has lived in this country for eighteen years and he has a clear record that proves his reliability and trustworthiness.  The Board construes these 
arguments as an assertion that the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge made a finding that Applicant traveled to the People's Republic of China on five occasions between 1994 and 2000 to visit his 
parents.  The Judge also found that Applicant contacted his parents by telephone approximately two times a month.  The Judge concluded based on these facts 
that Applicant's contacts with his parents were more than casual or infrequent.  Notwithstanding Applicant's assertions to the contrary on appeal, the Board 
concludes that there is adequate support in the record for the Administrative Judge's conclusion that Applicant's contacts with his parents were of sufficient 
magnitude to be of unmitigated security concern.</P> 
 
<P>By asserting that none of his relatives in the People's Republic of China could be used by a foreign government to make him to harmful things to the United 
States, Applicant is merely drawing an alternate set of conclusions from the record evidence that differ from the conclusions reached by  the Administrative 
Judge.  The ability to formulate a different interpretation of the record evidence from that adopted by the Administrative Judge is insufficient to demonstrate 
that the Judge committed error.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-15383 (July 29, 2003) at pp. 3-4.  The Board concludes, after a review of the totality of the record, that 
the Administrative Judge's ultimate conclusion that Applicant's relationship with his relatives living in the People's Republic of China poses an unacceptable 
risk of foreign influence is sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant points to his eighteen years of residence in the United States, his pronounced support for this country and his clean record as evidence that his 
relationship with his relatives in the People's Republic of China does not pose a potential threat to the security of this country.  The favorable evidence cited by 
Applicant is evidence that the Administrative Judge was required to consider.  The Judge is responsible for weighing the evidence of record, both favorable and 
unfavorable before making his ultimate security clearance determination.  Absent a showing that the Judge did so in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law, the Board will not disturb the Judge's weighing of the evidence.  In this case, Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's assessment of the 
relative strength and weakness of the favorable and unfavorable evidence is not sufficient to persuade the Board that the Judge acted in a manner that is 
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  Accordingly, the Judge's adverse conclusions are sustainable.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision. </P>
