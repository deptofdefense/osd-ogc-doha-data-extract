<P>	Applicant's answers to two questions on her personnel security application were false.  She 
admitted the falsifications, but supplied credible evidence to demonstrate that the falsifications were

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.  On June 25, 2003, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-25150.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and 
Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-25150.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis 
for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 12, 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an 
administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on October 16, 2003.  On November 19, 2003, 
I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding 
on December 1, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal 
Conduct.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all three allegations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is 38 years old, married, and the mother of four children, ages 15, 14, 13, and 11.  
She is employed as a mail clerk for a government contractor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	As a teenager, Applicant used marijuana, PCP, and alcohol.  In 1987 when she was 
approximately 22 years old, she began using crack cocaine.  She used Social Security payments from 
her son's deceased father to support her drug habit.  Between 1992 and 1995, Applicant used crack 
cocaine several times a day.  During this time, she was also using alcohol two or three times a week.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In November of 1995, when she was pregnant with a child she later gave up for adoption, 
Applicant sought medical treatment and voluntarily enrolled in a substance abuse program.  The day 
she entered the program, she tested positive for drug use.  She has not used illegal drugs or alcohol 
since November 1995.  She does not intend to use drugs or alcohol in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	From November 1995 to December 1996, Applicant was enrolled in an outpatient drug and 
alcohol treatment program that required her attendance and active participation three times a week.  
She participated in group, family, and one-on-one counseling.  After a year of active participation,  
and with the support of her family, Applicant successfully completed the program and was awarded 
a certificate of completion in December 1996.  Since that time, she has acquired a responsible job, 
married, and focused her attention on raising her four children, three of whom are now in their early 
teen years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's husband appeared as a character witness on her behalf.  He described her courage 
in overcoming her addictions, her commitment as a wife and mother to family life, and her good 
character.  Applicant submitted seven letters from coworkers and friends attesting to her strong work 
ethic, her determination to succeed and to be of service to others, and her good character.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	On January 17, 2002, Applicant completed, signed and certified a security clearance 
application (SF-86).  Question 27 on the SF-86 reads as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	<STRONG>Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Illegal Use of Drugs</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any 
controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics 
(opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, 
methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant answered "no" to Question 27.  In her testimony, Applicant admitted that her last 
use of crack cocaine was in November 1995, on the day she entered the substance abuse program, 
six years and two months before she answered Question 27.  She denied deliberately falsifying her 
answer.  In January 2002, in determining the number of years since her last drug use, she counted 
as follows: 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and concluded that more than seven years 
had passed since her last use of illegal drugs.  (Tr. 27.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Question 30 on the SF-86 reads as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	<STRONG>Your Use of Alcohol</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages (such a liquor, beer, wine) resulted 
in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?  Do 
not repeat information reported in module [19] on form SF86 (Your Medical Record).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant answered "no" to Question 30.  In her testimony, Applicant admitted she had been 
enrolled in a year-long drug and alcohol treatment program from November 1995 until December 
1996.  The drug and alcohol treatment program ended in December 1996, five years and two months 
before Applicant answered Question 30.  Applicant testified that she had not had any alcohol to drink 
since entering the program in November 1995.  She denied deliberately falsifying her answer.  In 
January 2002, in determining the number of years since her participation in the drug and alcohol 
treatment program, she counted as follows: 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, and 
concluded that more than seven years had passed since her participation in the alcohol-related 
treatment program.  (Tr. 37.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	On March 21, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a special investigator of the Investigations 
Service of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  In the presence of the OPM 
special investigator, Applicant completed and signed an affidavit.  In her affidavit  Applicant stated: 
"I answered the question[s 27 and 30] dishonestly (on the form) because I did not think the drug use 
and treatment was within the seven-year period."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In her testimony, Applicant attributed her failure to accurately count the years since her last 
use of illegal drugs and her participation in the substance abuse program to mistake and not to 
intentional falsification or dishonesty.  She said she thought the use of the word "dishonestly" in her 
affidavit had been suggested by the special investigator.  The special investigator did not appear as 
a witness.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 
527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well 
as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. 
Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security 
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors 
listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely 
an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal 
or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being 
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a 
nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed 
in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. 
ay 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the 
burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden 
of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant demonstrated disqualifying conduct under Guideline 
E (Personal Conduct) when she failed to disclose </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in response to Question 27 on her SF-86 that she 
had used crack cocaine and had tested positive for its use on November 14, 1995, which was less 
than seven years from the time she completed her SF-86 in January 2002 (&para; 1.a(1) and &para; 1.a(2)) and 
that she had failed to disclose alcohol-related treatment within seven years from the time she 
completed her SF-86 in January 2002. (&para; 1.b.)  DOHA alleged Applicant's omissions were 
intentional falsifications of her SF-86.  Applicant attributed the "no" answers to Questions 27 and 
30 to an honest mistake in calculation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, such as falsification, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  When an applicant 
deliberately provides false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an 
investigator or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness 
determination, this raises a security concern and may be disqualifying.  E2.A5.1.2.3.  The security 
concern resulting from falsification can be mitigated if it was an isolated incident, was not recent, 
and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.  E2.A5.1.3.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant denied deliberately providing false information on her SF-86.  When questioned 
by the OPM investigator, she admitted she had given negative answers to questions 27 and 30 
because she thought seven years had passed since she had used illegal drugs and had completed the 
drug and alcohol rehabilitation program.  She answered the investigator's questions fully and 
truthfully.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	We begin by examining whether Applicant's "no" answers to Questions 27 and 30 on her SF-86 constitute deliberate falsification of her security clearance application.  The record clearly 
indicates that Applicant completed and signed a security clearance application on January 17, 2002 
on which Questions 27 and 30 were answered "no."  All other questions were answered truthfully.  
Applicant's explanation, that her two "no" answers were the result of an honest mistake in counting 
back seven years, is credible.  I did not observe in her demeanor any attempt to deceive or to be 
untruthful.  The record does not reflect attempts by Applicant to conceal her past.  The character 
testimony presented by Applicant's husband and the seven letters from friends and colleagues 
admitted into evidence as her Exhibits A through G attested to her honorable character.  A friend 
who grew up with Applicant and has known her for 26 years wrote this about her:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	[Applicant] is an inspiration to those persons who have faced challenging diversities in life.  
She has worked diligently in putting her life in order, and displays confidence in her abilities, 
and in her achievements.  She is truly an enterprising person, and sets high standards for 
herself both personally and professionally.  Once those standards are in place, [Applicant] 
goes forth in making her dreams come true for both her and her family.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA's Appeal Board states that an 
administrative judge, in deciding an Applicant's security worthiness, "must consider the record as 
a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the 
unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>."  I have considered the evidence as a whole and I have evaluated 
Applicant's conduct under the whole person concept of the Directive.  I do not find Applicant's "no" 
answers to Questions 27 and 30 on her SF-86 to be deliberate falsifications under Guideline E of the 
Directive.  Applicant's explanation that the "no" answers were honest mistakes in calculating the 
passage of time is credible.  I conclude that she has successfully overcome the Government's case 
opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the allegations in the SOR are concluded 
for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
