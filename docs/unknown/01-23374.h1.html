<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 11, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings 
and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated October 14, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing 
record. In his Answer, Applicant admits to the SOR allegations (subparagraphs 1.d).  He denies 1.a. through 1.c.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 15, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to 
the parties on February 2, 2004, and the hearing was held on March 5, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 6) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, 
offered two documentary exhibits  (Exhibits A and B) and offered his own testimony. After the hearing, the record was left open, and Applicant offered an 
additional documentary exhibit (Exhibit C),  which was not objected to by Department Counsel. </SPAN>The transcript (TR) was received on<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> March 23, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony of Applicant at the hearing, and 
the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 43 year old employee of a defense contractor <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that seeks a security clearance on his behalf</SPAN>.<STRONG> </STRONG>He is married and has two children. He has a Bachelors 
degree in information technology.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial difficulties. He owes approximately $6,600 to a credit card company for a debt which was charged off about five years ago. 
Applicant has made no payment on this debt. He testified that he attempted to work out an agreement with this creditor to pay a reduced sum to settle this debt, 
and to pay it out in a multiple payment plan, but the company indicated to him that it wanted Applicant to pay the full amount owed in one lump sum. Applicant 
does not intend to make any payments on this debt, but planned to wait until it falls off his credit report (Tr at 46-48, 50).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On his credit report, Applicant was alleged to owe one company $44 for a past due account. Applicant</SPAN> testified that he was not familiar with this creditor or this 
debt, and when he disputed this bill with a credit reporting service, it was deleted from his credit report (TR at 31, 32, Exhibit 2). Therefore, I conclude that this 
debt is not due and owing.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant owed $4,896 to a mortgage company for a past due account. This was for a condominium, on which  Applicant had a mortgage of $94,130 ( TR at<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
41-43)</SPAN>.  Ultimately this property was foreclosed and the mortgage company took possession of the property. Applicant testified that he has had no contact from 
the creditor once the home was foreclosed, and the credit reports do not show that Applicant owes anything to this creditor (Exhibit 1, Exhibit 2).   Based on the 
creditor's failure to take any action against Applicant, and the lack of negative information about this debt in any credit report, I must conclude that this debt is 
not due and owing.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant had several reasons for his financial difficulties. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These include: 1) the loss of his wife's income because of a disability while she was pregnant; 2) the 
inability of Applicant to sell his condominium without taking a substantial loss, and the non-rental payment for several months by his condominium tenants; 
and, 3) Applicant's reduced income because he changed jobs within his company in order to try to have more security. All of these contributed to his financial 
problems.</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Finally, Applicant testified that in 2003, he purchased an undeveloped parcel of land for his retirement. The total amount of the land was $39,900, and he paid 
approximately $10,000 down (TR at 48-50).  <STRONG>      </STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully 
considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising 
or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn . . .).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness and his current unwillingness to 
make payment on the delinquent outstanding debt, despite his ability to resolve this debt. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3.E2.A6.1.2.3. (A history of not meeting financial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), because of his failure to pay for the 
outstanding debt and his stated intention not to make any payments on this debt.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3, which involves debts that result from circumstances beyond the person's control, I find that it is applicable 
to this case. Applicant's indebtedness was partially due to circumstances beyond his control, specifically, the loss of his wife's income because of her disability 
while pregnant, the inability of Applicant to sell his condominium for a reasonable price and the non-rental payment by his tenants, and Applicant's reduced 
income because he changed jobs within his company in order to try to have more security, all contributed to his financial problems. However, based on his 
ability to pay approximately $10,000 to purchase retirement property in 2003, I conclude Applicant has had the means to resolve this $6,600 debt, and the 
circumstances that contributed to his past indebtedness cannot mitigate his current situation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appears to have made a good-faith effort to resolve most of his debts. However,  because of his remaining indebtedness, and his unwillingness to 
resolve this debt, Applicant has failed to mitigate his financial difficulties.  Until he can establish a record of financial responsibility, security concerns will 
continue to exist under Guideline F.  I resolve Guideline F against Applicant, and I conclude Applicant has not established, at this time, that it is "clearly 
consistent with the national interest" that he should be granted the privilege of a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
