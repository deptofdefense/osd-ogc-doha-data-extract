<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated January 10, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross  issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated November 4, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Board can consider new evidence presented by Applicant on appeal; and (2) whether 
Applicant can be granted an interim security clearance so that he can prove he is trustworthy.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative 
Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board can consider new evidence presented by Applicant on appeal</SPAN>.  Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings of fact 
about his history of financial difficulties.  However, Applicant asserts: (a) his financial situation has improved; (b) he has made arrangements to pay off some of 
his past due debts; (c) the family support office has recalculated the amount of his monthly payments; and (d) he is trying to make arrangements to start 
repaying a student loan.  Applicant's assertions constitute new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.29.</P> 
 
<P>During the proceedings below, Applicant had the opportunity to present evidence on his own behalf, and he took advantage of that opportunity to present 
testimonial and documentary evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider in his case.  Nothing in Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or general 
principles of federal administrative law gives the parties a right to supplement the record evidence continuously.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (February 
13, 2001) at pp. 3-4 (the right to present evidence in DOHA proceedings must be exercised within provisions of the Directive and the practical need for 
administrative finality in these proceedings)(citing <EM>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</EM>, 435 U.S. 519, 554-555 
(1978)).</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant can be granted an interim security clearance so that he can prove he is trustworthy</SPAN>.  Applicant also asks that he be granted an interim 
security clearance so that he can have the time to pay his debts and prove he is trustworthy.  Applicant asks for relief which cannot be granted.  Under the 
Directive, there is no authority to grant a conditional or probationary security clearance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-24318 (May 23, 2003) at p. 3; ISCR Case 
No. 01-07629 (April 5, 2002) at p. 3.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> Nothing in Applicant's appeal brief raises any claim of error with respect to the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance 
questionnaire in July 2002.  Because there is no presumption of error below, the Judge's unchallenged finding and conclusion about that falsification stand.
