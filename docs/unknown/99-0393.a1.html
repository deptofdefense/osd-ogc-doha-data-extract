<P>Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola issued a decision, dated October 19, 1999 in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  for the reasons set forth below, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive) dated January 2,
1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated June 11, 1999 to Applicant.  The SOR was base on
Criterion G (Alcohol Consumption) and Criterion F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant requested a hearing which was held on September
22, 1999.  On October 19, 1999, the Administrative Judge issued his decision which included formal findings for Applicant under Criterion
F<A HREF="99-0393.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> but formal findings against Applicant under Criterion G.</P>

<P>The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's decision below noted that Applicant was "an admitted alcoholic."   The Administrative Judge found that
Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess and to the point of intoxication from 1978 to 1989 and again from 1997 to January 3, 1999. 
During Applicant's periods of excessive alcoholic consumption he engaged in a violent altercation and had three documented arrests for
driving under the influence. The Administrative Judge concluded that given Applicant's history and his relatively short recent history of
abstinence it was premature to grant Applicant a clearance.  </P>

<P>Applicant does not challenge any specific finding of fact or conclusion of law in the Administrative Judge's decision below.  Rather,
Applicant states: a) that alcoholism is a disease and that he doesn't believe he should be punished for being born with an illness, b) that he is
very well educated about the disease, c) that he attends several meetings a week, d) that he takes full responsibility for his actions, e) that he
associates with sober people dedicated to working the twelve steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, f) that he knows that a clearance is a privilege,
g) that he has been abstinent for several months, and h) that he has several letters of recommendation in the record.  The Board construes
these arguments taken together as an assertion that the Administrative Judge's decision below was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law. 
For the reasons that follow the Board concludes that Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Administrative Judge's decision was
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P>

<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information. 
<EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Security clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather predictive judgments
about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S.
518, 528-29 (1988).</P>

<P>Alcohol abuse provides a rational basis for the government to question an applicant's security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g. Cole v. Young</EM>, 351 U.S.
536, 550 n. 13 (1956); <EM>Croft v. Department of Air Force</EM>, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 (1989).  It was entirely proper for the Administrative
Judge to consider and rely on Applicant's lengthy history of excessive alcohol consumption and alcohol- related incidents as a rational basis
for the Administrative Judge's doubts about Applicant's security eligibility.  Applicant's recent history of abstinence (found by the
Administrative Judge to be nine months although there is testimony suggesting it was shorter than that) is simply too short to overcome
Applicant's over-all history of alcohol abuse.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's description of Applicant as "an admitted alcoholic" was an unfortunate choice of words because a reasonable
person could infer the Judge was impermissibly basing his decision, in part, on Applicant's status rather than Applicant's history of alcohol
abuse.  It would have been wrong for the Judge to base his adverse decision on Applicant's status as "an admitted alcoholic."  A reading of the
Judge's decision in its entirety persuades the Board that the Judge relied on Applicant's overall history of alcohol abuse, not Applicant's status
as an alcoholic, to make his adverse security clearance decision.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's October 19,
1999 decision.</P>
