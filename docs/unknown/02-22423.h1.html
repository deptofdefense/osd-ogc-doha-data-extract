<P>Applicant has mitigated alcohol abuse that occurred many years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem.  However, he has failed to mitigate his use 
of marijuana over a 22 year period, including after submitting his security clearance application (SF 86).  Moreover, Applicant has failed to mitigate his 
falsifications concerning his drug use not only on his SF 86 but to DSS investigators on two occasions.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 15, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-22423.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-22423.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR details security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline G (Alcohol 
Consumption), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  The SOR states that DOHA was unable to find that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant him access to classified information and recommends that his case be submitted to an Administrative Judge.</P> 
<P>On October 31, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision on the record in lieu of a hearing.  On December 2, 2003, Applicant requested a 
hearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 26, 2004 and the hearing was held on February 11, 2004.  
During the hearing, six Government exhibits (Govt Ex), seven Applicant exhibits (Ap Ex), and the testimony of four Applicant witnesses, including Applicant, 
were received.  The transcript (Tr) was received on February 24, 2004.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Having thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's admissions to all the allegations,<A HREF="02-22423.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 40-year-old test driver of military vehicles employed by a defense contractor.  His employer rates him as a skilled and valued employee.  
Applicant is seeking a security clearance.</P> 
<P>From 1981 until 1995, Applicant used marijuana as often as twice per month.  From 1995 until July 2000, he used marijuana no more than once or twice per 
year (SOR &para; 1.a, 4.a). </P> 
<P>From September 1982 until September 1985, Applicant served on active duty with the United States Army.  During his military service, he held a security 
clearance.  On one occasion, Applicant was caught with alcoholic beverages in his barracks room.  He was required to attend an alcohol and drug education 
class (SOR &para; 2.c). </P> 
<P>From September 1982 and March 1990, Applicant consumed alcohol on a daily basis.  On some occasions, he drank to the point he passed out (SOR &para; 2.b).</P> 
<P>From 1983 until 1984, Applicant used hashish as often as twice per month (SOR &para; 1.b, 4.a).  Between 1988 and 1990, Applicant used cocaine on at least two 
occasions (SOR &para; 1.c, 4.a).</P> 
<P>On March 30, 1990, Applicant was involved in an automobile accident.  He was charged with Speeding, Negligent Driving, and Driving Under the Influence 
(DUI), after being administered a breathalyzer.  On September 19, 1990, Applicant plead guilty to Negligent Driving, was convicted of that offense, fined, and 
placed on probation for two years (SOR &para; 2.a, 4.b). </P> 
<P>Since his driving conviction, Applicant has substantially reduced his consumption of alcohol.  Between March 1990 and March 2002, he drank to the point of 
intoxication approximately once per year (SOR &para; 2.d).</P> 
<P>In May 1998, funds were removed from Applicant's delivery truck.  Applicant was required to reimburse his employer $600.00  (SOR &para; 3.d).  </P> 
<P>In October 1998, Applicant adulterated his urine sample on a random drug test with a substance containing pyridine, a drug masking agent.  As a result of the 
adulterated urine sample, Applicant was involuntarily terminated by his employer (SOR &para; 3.c).     </P> 
<P>On February 14, 2001, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86).  In response to question 27,<A HREF="02-22423.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant answered, "no," and deliberately 
failed to report his use of marijuana (SOR &para; 3.a, 4.c).</P> 
<P>On March 18, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Defense Security Service (DSS).  Applicant provided a sworn statement in which he 
deliberately falsified material facts by denying he had taken any illegal drugs, to include marijuana, within the past seven years (SOR &para; 3.b, 4.c). </P> 
<P>On June 10, 2002, Applicant provided a sworn statement to a DSS investigator.  Applicant admitted he lied to a DSS investigator on March 18, 2002, by 
denying any illegal drug use within the past seven years (SOR &para; 3.b, 4.c).  He admitted using marijuana at a friend's birthday party in July 2000.  Applicant 
further stated, "I do not intend to use any illegal drug in the future."</P> 
<P>In July 2003, Applicant used marijuana at the birthday party for the same friend at whose birthday party he had used marijuana in July 2000. </P> 
<P>In January 2004, Applicant voluntarily submitted to an evaluation by an outpatient substance abuse treatment service.  He underwent tests for drugs and alcohol 
that were negative.  Applicant was enrolled in a 12 hour alcohol and drug education program.   </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<P>Department Counsel is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  Directive 
E3.1.14.  The applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.  Directive E3.1.15.</P> 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of national security.  Directive E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H: Drug Involvement</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline H is that improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline H include E2.A8.1.2.1, any drug abuse (Disqualifying Condition 1).  
Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A8.1.3.1, the drug involvement was not recent.  They also include E2.A8.1.3.3, a demonstrated 
intent not to abuse any drugs in the future (Mitigating Condition 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline G is that excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control 
impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  Conditions that could  raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying under Guideline G include E2.A7.1.2.1, alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, 
child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use (Disqualifying Condition 1).  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include 
E2.A7.1.3.2, the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem (Mitigating Condition 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: Personal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline E is conduct involving questionable judgment,  untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Conditions that could  raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline E include E2.A5.1.2.2 (Disqualifying Condition 2).   Disqualifying Condition 2 addresses the deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used 
to conduct investigations, determine employment, qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities.  Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline E also include E2.A5.1.2.3 (Disqualifying 
Condition 3).  Disqualifying Condition 3 covers deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an 
investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness 
determination. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern under Guideline J is a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  Conditions 
that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying under Guideline J include E2.A10.1.2.1, allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless 
of whether the person was formally charged (Disqualifying Condition 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include E2.A10.1.3.1, the criminal behavior was not recent (Mitigating Condition 1).  They also include 
E2.A10.1.3.2, the crime was an isolated incident (Mitigating Condition 2), and E2.A10.1.3.6, there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (Mitigating 
Condition 6).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H: Drug Involvement</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admitted drug use, including the use of marijuana over a 22 year period and as recently as last year, raises Disqualifying Condition 1.  Although 
Applicant insists he will not continue his use of marijuana, the record does not support a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drug in the future.  After having 
used marijuana the year before he submitted his SF 86 in this case, Applicant told a DSS investigator he had no intention of doing so again.  A year later, 
however, Applicant used marijuana again.  His actions not only do not demonstrate an intent not to abuse any drug in the future but suggest just the opposite.  
Therefore, I find against Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 1.      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G: Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's DUI and admitted history of alcohol abuse are the type of alcohol-related incident away from work addressed by Disqualifying Condition 1.  
However, the DUI occurred over 14 years ago and the evidence of record indicates Applicant has substantially reduced his consumption of alcohol since that 
offense.  Because the drinking problem occurred so many years ago and there is no indication of any recent problem, in accordance with Mitigating Condition 
2, I find in favor of Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: Personal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's employer required him to reimburse $600.00 for funds that were stolen from his delivery truck in May 1998, the record fails to establish 
he intentionally or negligently failed to safeguard the funds.  Therefore, I find in favor of Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 3.d.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant's admitted deliberate omission of his drug abuse from the SF 86 supports Disqualifying Condition 2 (SOR &para; 3.a).  His denial of such use to 
a DSS investigator in March 2002 supports Disqualifying Condition 3 (SOR &para; 3.b).  Moreover, he continued to lie to a DSS investigator in June 2002, when he 
denied responsibility for the adulterating agent in his urine sample in October 1998 (SOR &para; 3.c).  Tr at 34-35.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asks to be excused for these recent and repeated failures but the record provides no basis for doing so.  Unfortunately, he did not admit his lies 
promptly and before being confronted with the facts.  The extent of Applicant's lies with respect to his pending security clearance application raise serious 
security concerns that he has failed to mitigate.  Therefore, I find against Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J: Criminal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's only alcohol-related offense was not recent, occurring more than 14 years ago. However, it is not an isolated incident of his criminal behavior.  His 
recent false statements to investigators and on his SF 86 in connection with his pending application for a security clearance constitute violations of 18 U.S.C. 
1001.  Although his recent use of marijuana may be limited, it also constitutes a violation of both federal and state law.  Applicant's admissions of these acts 
supports Disqualifying Condition 1.  Given the recent nature of his falsification offenses, the record does not afford clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  
Therefore, I find against Applicant with regard to SOR &para; 4. </SPAN></P>
