<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns were raised regarding a 42-year-old Iranian-born naturalized U.S. citizen who was sent to the U.S. when he was 17 years old by his father

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 20, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written answer, dated December 5, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was 
assigned to me on February 23, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day, and the hearing was held before me on March 23, 2004.  During the course 
of the hearing, three Government exhibits, 14 Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of four Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on March 31, 2004.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been revealed.  He had previously 
held an interim clearance.</SPAN></P>

under the Shah, retired during the revolution in 1979 rather than serve the new theocratic republic.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  As a precaution to avoid prosecution from the new regime 
because of his father's position in the former government, in late 1978 or early 1979, when he was 17-years-old, Applicant was sent by his family to the U.S. 
where he joined his older half-brother--a son of their common mother--who had, 10 years earlier, come to the U.S. for his own college education.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Upon his 
arrival in the U.S., Applicant resided with his half-brother and enrolled in high school.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He graduated from a U.S. high school, attended a U.S. community

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to support himself while attending college, Applicant held a variety of positions, including dishwasher, cook, and manager for several restaurants, and 
worked up to 60 hours per week.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant met his future wife--a U.S.-born citizen--during this period while they were employed by the same restaurant.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  
They married in 1986, and now have three children.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his wife own and reside in a house with an appraised value of $410,000.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  They have a

and Iran.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's relationship with his father was somewhat distant, due primarily to his father's lengthy military career and the fact that his father took a second 
wife.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  After his immigration to the U.S., Applicant had "contact" with his father about one time every five years.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  The exact nature of the contact was not

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to both adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_63_"><SUP> (63)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal 
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his 
immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, his brother and sister--are not citizens or residents of 
the United States or may be subject to duress.  The concern also carried over to Applicant's mother because of her citizenship status as a non-citizen permanent 
resident of the U.S.  These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could 
result in the compromise of classified information.  In support of its contentions, the government has cited the fact Applicant's mother is a citizen of Iran, and 
his brother and sister are citizens of, and reside in, Iran.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is uncontroverted that Applicant's mother is a citizen of Iran residing in the U.S., and his brother and sister are citizens and residents of Iran.  Those simple 
facts, standing alone, might be sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  
However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_64_"><SUP> (64)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The citizenship and resident status of Applicant's brother and sister, as well as the citizenship status of his mother, when considered in light of the nature of the 
government in Iran--a totalitarian theocratic government whose interests are inimical to the United States and which is known to conduct intelligence 
operations and economic espionage against the U.S.--activates Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, 
or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) and DC E2.A2.1.2.2. 
(<EM>sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse influence or duress exists</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>), as well as 
C E2.A2.1.3.3. (<EM>contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>).  In this instance, after an examination of the evidence, I 
determine that the relationship between Applicant and his brother cannot be considered anything closer than casual and infrequent, if that.  Applicant has not 
seen his brother in 25 years, nor been in contact with him more frequently than once every two years, with the most recent contact having taken place either last 
year or the year before.  Their relationship over 25 years ago was strained when the family split up and there is nothing in evidence to indicate it has, in any 
way, improved since then.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only person seemingly coming within the ambit of security concern is Applicant's sister.  That relationship, while continuing solely via telephone 
communications once or twice a year, remains emotionally, but not physically, close.  They have not seen each other for 25 years, and even before that period 
the relationship, as with the one with his brother, and for the same reasons, was strained.  Applicant sends her a modest stipend to augment her living expenses, 
but nothing more.  As far as the potential for influence is concerned, it should be noted that Applicant has declared he would cease sending her support if 
threatened in any way because his family in the U.S. is more important to him than his sister.  And, in fact, when asked for reimbursement for medical expenses 
for his sister, Applicant refused to provide it.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Equally meaningful is the historical perspective.  Since his arrival in the U.S. 25 years ago, and especially since he has been employed by a defense contractor 
since 1997, there have been no instances of Iranian government efforts to capitalize on his sister's Iranian residence and citizenship or Applicant's employment 
or security clearance status.  When asked what he would do if Iran threatened his sister unless he furnished sensitive, or even something innocuous such as a 
telephone book or newspapers, Applicant declared he would not risk his own family or his country, referring to his family in the U.S. or the U.S. government, in 
favor of his sister, and would immediately report the situation to the authorities.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_65_"><SUP> (65)</SUP></A>  He added that even if she were tortured, while he loves her, he would not 
put his family in jeopardy because he loves his family a lot more than his sister.<A HREF="02-23755.h1.html#N_66_"><SUP> (66)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The best predictor of whether an applicant's relatives are in a position to be exploited in the future by a government which has no interest in complying with 
human rights and liberties, or even with the accepted rules and norms of international law, is the government's past conduct.  Considering all of the above, 
including the Iran's past conduct, as well as the citizenship and residency status of Applicant's sister, I do not consider her to constitute an unacceptable security 
risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the citizenship and residency status of Applicant's mother, I do not consider her to constitute an unacceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also applicable, in this instance, is MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (<EM>foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security 
responsibilities</EM>).  As noted above, neither Applicant nor his wife has any financial interests in Iran whereas their entire holdings are in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case under Guideline 
B.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
