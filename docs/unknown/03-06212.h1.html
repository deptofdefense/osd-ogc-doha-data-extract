<P>This 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor has an ongoing history of 23 delinquent debts, beginning in about 2000, and totaling approximately $15,000. 
He has made no substantive efforts to resolve any of the debts and has not demonstrated financial rehabilitation.  Mitigation has not been established.  
Clearance is denied.    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On October 18, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge on the 
written record, i.e., without a hearing.  Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 19,  2005.  The Form instructed Applicant that 
any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days of its receipt by Applicant.  Any response was due by June 16, 2005, but no submission to the 
FORM has been received.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on July 7, 2005. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. The SOR contains 23  allegations, 1.a. - 1.w., under Guideline F (Financial). Applicant admits all 
23 allegations.  His explanations focus on matters other than the facts and circumstances of the debts, themselves.  All admitted allegations are accepted and 
made Findings of Fact. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>After considering the totality of  the evidence of record in the FORM, I make the following FINDINGS OF FACT as to each SOR allegation, based on the 
contents of the FORM, including Applicant's sworn statement and his response to the SOR.  No response to the FORM was submitted.</P> 
 
<P>As alleged in the SOR, under:</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P><EM>Guideline F (Financial)</EM></P> 
 
<P>As of the issuance of the SOR, Applicant owed the approximate amounts states on the following debts that were past due, delinquent, charged off,  referred for 
collection, or reduced to judgment:</P> 
 
<P>1.a. - Bank A - $1,902; </P> 
 
<P>1.b. - Medical Debt B - $176.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.c. - Law Firm C  - $45.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.d. - Credit Union D - $410.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.e. - Credit Union E - $346.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.f. - Company F - $52.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.g. - Law Firm G - $52.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.h. - Law Firm H - $43.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.I -  Company I - $1,374.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.j. - Company J - $2,039.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.k. - Credit Union K - $93.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.l. - Credit Union L - $78.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.m. - Collection Agency M - $43.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.n. - Credit Union N - $884.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.o. - Credit Union O - $195.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.p. - Credit Union P - $811.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.q. - Credit Union Q - $1,478.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.r. - Credit Union - $195.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.s. - Credit Union S - $144.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.t. - Collection Agency T - $664.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.u. - Credit Union U - $1,890.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.v. - Company V - $343.00;</P> 
 
<P>1.w. - Collection Agency E - $1,460.00;</P> 
 
<P>These delinquent debts go back as far as the year 2000. Applicant has been aware of the Government's concerns since at least December 2002, when he gave 
his sworn statement to an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). Applicant admits all 23 delinquent debts, which exceed $15,000.00. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden 
(either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 45 years old.  His financial conduct, as cited in the SOR and FORM, raises serious question about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness 
under four separate guidelines of DoD Directive 5220.6.  I find all of the allegations to be supported by the Government's evidence. After carefully considering 
all of Applicant's explanations, I  find the Applicant has not demonstrated financial rehabilitation as to the concerns expressed under Guideline F.   </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><EM>Financial Considerations</EM></STRONG><EM></EM> -  Applicant admitted the accuracy of all of the 23 delinquent debts, which is also established by the overall record evidence.<A HREF="03-06212.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  None 
of the debts have been satisfied or otherwise resolved.  On this basis, I conclude that all of the 23 delinquent debts cited in the SOR remain outstanding.</P> 
 
<P>This matter was submitted to me on the written record, which ends as to substantive matters with Applicant's response to the SOR.  Applicant did not respond 
to the FORM, which definitively stated the Government's concerns as to Applicant's financial situation.     </P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered Applicant's explanations.  As I understand his claims, he has been a single parent since 1991, he has been cutting his budget, 
considering bankruptcy, making phone calls and contacting creditors (Item 7, which is dated October 25, 2003).  There is no evidence that Applicant carried 
through with his efforts or that any resolution of the cited debts has occurred, including even the smallest dollar amounts. </P> 
 
<P>I have also carefully considered his representation as to his military and other service to this country since at least 1980.  While this could certainly be taken into 
consideration if Applicant had made some movement toward resolving his debts, his failure to make any substantive improvements in his situation over many 
years, particularly since receiving the SOR, is compelling.  He has made promises as to future action that have not been carried out more than two years later.  
Promises can be treated as evidence but, in the absence of evidence of substantial performance, such promises are minimal and do not even come close to 
mitigating the evidence of the 23 long term delinquent debts cited in the SOR.  </P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions - (1) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and (3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts are applicable.  However, none of 
the parallel Mitigating Conditions have been established by the record.  </P> 
 
<P>A year must pass after a final decision before  Applicant can request reconsideration of his request for a DoD security  clearance.  During this period, Applicant 
will have the opportunity to address the issues stated above.  As of now, however, he has not met his burden of establishing that he possesses the good 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets.</P>
