<P>Applicant mitigated the security concerns by demonstrating that his family members living in Jordan were not agents of a foreign government or so situated as 
to provide a point of influence on Applicant. Clearance granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 18 December 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or 
revocation of his clearance because of foreign influence, foreign preference, and personal conduct.<A HREF="02-39878.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 29 January 2004 and 
requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 8 October 2004 and I convened a hearing on 14 January 2005. DOHA received the transcript 24 January 
2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">     At the hearing (Tr. 23-29) I excluded GE 5 under paragraph E3.1.22 of the Directive, effectively precluding the government from establishing its case on 
subparagraph 1.f. and 3.a. Accordingly, I enter findings for the Applicant on those two allegations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations under Guideline B, but denied the allegations under Guidelines C and E; accordingly I incorporate those admission as  
findings of fact. He is a 39-year-old technical staffer for by a defense contractor, so employed since January 1994. He seeks to retain the clearance he has held 
since approximately April 1990.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the Jordan in February 1965, and immigrated to the U.S. in August 1982. In so doing, he avoided two-years mandatory military service 
required of all Jordanians age 18 and older. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 1988. He got his first U.S. passport the same month; he renewed his 
U.S. passport in March 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in August 1982, he did so using a Jordanian passport issued in July 1982. That passport expired in July 1985. He did 
not use it to travel before becoming a U.S. citizen, or renew it when it expired. He did not travel out of the U.S. until becoming a citizen, and has used only his 
U.S. passport to travel.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has two brothers who are naturalized citizens and residents of the U.S.  He has five siblings (two brothers/three sisters) who are citizens and residents 
of Lebanon. None work for the government. Two of his sisters are housewives. His other sister and two brothers are employed in the private sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother is a Jordanian citizen who is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. and resides in the U.S. most of the year. However, she typically travels 
to Jordan 3-4 months per year to visit her children and grandchildren there. When she does so, Applicant and his two brothers living in the U.S. give her money 
to handle her expenses in Jordan, including rent. Applicant's contribution is about $100.00 per month.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since coming to the U.S. in 1982, Applicant has traveled to Jordan four times. He traveled there in June 1992 to visit family and become engaged. He returned 
to Jordan in July 1993 to marry and visit family. He returned in August 1995 to visit family. He and his wife traveled to Jordan in December 2000 to adopt an 
infant who had been abandoned at birth.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant traveled to Jordan in 1992, 1993, 1995, he registered with the Jordanian equivalent of the selective service system. Doing so permitted him to 
leave Jordan without satisfying the mandatory military service requirement, and postponed that service while out of the country until age 37,<A HREF="02-39878.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> at which time it 
expires entirely. Applicant is not willing to serve in the Jordanian military and keeping his registration up to date permits him to avoid that service. He is 
willing to renounce his Jordanian citizenship, but the process is complicated and would require him to satisfy the military service requirement before 
renouncing his citizenship. Applicant is willing to bear arms for the U.S., even against Jordan, and has registered with the selective service system as required 
by U.S. law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999, have two children, a daughter born in the U.S. and their adopted son, who has derivative 
U.S. citizenship. They have heavily invested in the American way of life (AE B). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character references, both at and outside work, consider him a reliable and trustworthy person. He has an excellent work record and his employer 
recommends him for a clearance. He has adequately safeguarded company proprietary information. (AE A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with a mixed human rights record, but is not invasively involved in monitoring its citizens. Jordan maintains close relations 
with the U.S. Jordan is not known to be a collector of intelligence or economic information against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-39878.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B by demonstrating that Applicant's five siblings are citizens and residents of Jordan, as 
is his mother part of the year.<A HREF="02-39878.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> His travel to Jordan to visit family, and his support for his mother when she visits there, demonstrate that his contacts are more 
than casual, but otherwise lack independent security significance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> However, Applicant has met the relevant mitigating condition under foreign influence. Neither his mother nor his siblings are agents are of a foreign 
government, and none of them are so  situated as to provide a point of influence on Applicant, thus satisfying Mitigating Condition (MC) 1.<A HREF="02-39878.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> In particular, 
Jordan has a constitutional monarchy with a close relationship to the U.S. It does not collect U.S. economic or intelligence information. I resolve Guideline B 
for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government did not establish a Guideline C case. Applicant's dual citizenship is based solely on his birth in Jordan. He has not exercised his Jordanian 
citizenship since becoming a U.S. citizen. He has complied with Jordanian law by registering for military service, but as a means of obtaining the exemption 
from military service available to Jordanian citizens. Under these circumstances I do not consider his action an exercise of dual citizenship. Such registration 
does not constitute military service or a willingness to bear arms for Jordan. Indeed, Applicant has disavowed any willingness to bear arms for Jordan and has 
expressed his willingness to renounce his Jordanian citizenship, which, ironically, he can only do if he completes his military service obligation. I resolve 
Guideline C for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government did not establish a Guideline E case, as indicated in my procedural ruling above. I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
