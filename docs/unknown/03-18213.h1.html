<P>Applicant is a library tape manager for a defense contractor.  He was required to pay child support for two children but made only a few of the required 
payments.  He contests his paternity of one of the children but he has made no effort to resolve the paternity.  Applicant did not pay his federal and state taxes 
on time one year, but has since paid his state taxes for the year in question and has made arrangements to pay his federal taxes.  He falsified his security 
clearance application concerning his delinquent child support.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 23, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 27, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 8, 2004.  He denied all the allegations in the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  
The request for a hearing was received by DOHA on September 13, 2004, and Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on December 8, 
2004.  The case was assigned to me on December 9, 2004, and a notice of hearing was issued on January 5, 2005.  The hearing was held on February 10, 2005. 
Eight government exhibits, eight Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of the Applicant and two Applicant witnesses were received during the hearing.  The 
transcript was received on February 22, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 38 year old tape library manager for a defense contractor.  He had a security clearance while serving on active military duty.  He submitted a 
security clearance application to upgrade his clearance in 2003. After leaving active duty in 1990, Applicant worked for a series of telecommunication 
companies and was promoted steadily within those companies.  Unfortunately for Applicant, these companies closed making him unemployed and seeking a 
new position.  Applicant had periods of unemployment between jobs placing a strain on his finances.  Even after finding employment, he usually was being 
paid less than the job he lost.  His finances suffered during these times and Applicant did not pay all of his bills.  His last period of unemployment, before 
finding his present position with the defense contractor, lasted approximately two years.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been married three times and has four children.  He had two children from his first marriage but he is contesting his paternity of one of the 
children.  He was ordered to pay child support for the children by the divorce decree.  Applicant had twins from the second marriage and he is required to pay 
child support for those children.  Applicant is separated from his third wife.  There are no children from this marriage.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges four significant debts of about $59, 800 for Applicant.  Debt 1.a in the SOR was a bill for his third wife's  medical care provided by a local 
hospital.  Applicant and his wife thought the bill was paid by insurance.  As soon as they were informed the bill had not been paid by the insurance company, 
Applicant paid the bill.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.b in the SOR is a cell phone bill incurred by his third wife and charged off as a bad debt.  After he learned of the bill, Applicant contacted the telephone 
company.  The phone company was unable to provide information since the bill is old and in the company archives.  He is making arrangements with the phone 
company to pay the bill.  However, he has no documentary information to support his payment plan for this debt.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.c in the SOR is the largest of Applicant's bill and is for past due child support payments totaling  $58,118.  The child support of approximately $320 per 
month is for the two children from Applicant's first marriage.  Applicant filed for and was granted a divorce from his first wife in State A.  He was required to 
pay child support to state B for both children as a result of the divorce decree.  When his first wife would not let Applicant exercise his visitation rights, 
Applicant stopped payment of the child support for both children.  The children are in State B and the child support payments ordered by the court in State A 
are being enforced by the child services agency in State B and debt 1.c in the SOR is a debt to the child support agency in State B.  Applicant has made very few 
of the required child support payments in the approximately 15 years the child support payments have been in effect.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's first wife eventually permitted him to exercise his visitation rights and see the children.  In fact, child # 1, whose paternity he acknowledges, came 
to live with Applicant for approximately a year.  He contests his paternity of child # 2 and his requirement to pay support for that child.  Applicant has not paid 
the required child support for either of the children because he does not want it to appear he is acknowledging any paternity for child # 2.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  A blood test is 
required to disprove paternity but Applicant has made little effort to secure such testing.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant was advised by his mother and his financial counselor to set 
aside the child support payment for child # 1.  Applicant started to do that, but when he became unemployed, he used the funds to pay other bills and stopped 
setting aside funds.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant has twins by his second wife.  He does not contest the paternity of the twins and is current on his child support payments for 
those children.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.d in the SOR is for a credit card past due over 120 days.  Applicant's third wife took out the card in Applicant's name.  Applicant contacted the credit 
card company, was released from the debt, and the debt was removed from his credit report.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, Applicant's monthly expenses exceeded his monthly income.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  A subsequent monthly income and expense statement shows Applicant has sufficient 
monthly income to meet his monthly expenses.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant stated that at the end of the month, he usually has limited financial resources available.  This was 
attributed to his paying larger than normal payments on his bills.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not file or pay his federal and state income taxes on time for tax year 2001.  Before the time to file the taxes, Applicant contacted the Internal 
Revenue Service and was informed that if he has been receiving a refund in the past there is no rush to file a return on time.  For years in the past, Applicant and 
his wife had received refunds on their taxes.  Applicant and his wife waited until after the required filing time to file both their federal and state tax returns for 
2001.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The federal and state criminal statutes<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> pertaining to filing tax returns requires a willful failure to file returns on time.  Applicant and his wife paid their 
federal and state taxes on time in the tax years both before and after 2001. When the taxes for 2001 were finally calculated, Applicant and his wife owed both 
federal and state taxes rather than due a refund.  The state taxes for 2001 have been paid.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Arrangements are being made to pay the federal taxes for 2001.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When Applicant submitted his security clearance application, he answered "NO" to question 39 asking if, in the last 7 years, he has ever been delinquent over 
180 days on any debts.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  At the time, Applicant was past due over 180 days on the debts discussed above listed in the SOR as debts 1.a to 1.d.  Applicant stated 
that at the time he completed the form, he did not know of debts 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d.  He did know that he owed some child support as listed in debt 1.c and that it 
was past due over 180 days.  He acknowledge to security investigators he owed some child support but that he was working to have the debt resolved.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  
Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person 
concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a

<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-18213.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Conditions:  A security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financial irresponsibility 
may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of 
life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P> 
<P>Guideline J  - Criminal Conduct:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P> 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:  A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty<EM>, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigated security concerns, pertaining to the 
adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegation in the 
SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Applicant's delinquent debts bring the matter within Financial Considerations Disqualifying 
Conditions Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.2 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations); </EM>and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  
Applicant has sufficiently explained three of the four allegations of debt in the SOR as either paid in full or incurred by his wife and not him.  However, the 
child support debt, which is the overwhelming dollar value of his debts, is still outstanding.  I conclude the aforementioned Financial Consideration 
Disqualifying Conditions have been established as to debt 1.c of the SOR.</P> 
<P>The Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions that apply here are Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment . . . </EM>)); and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  While Applicant and his wife lost good paying jobs not through their fault, there were sufficient financial resources to pay 
recurring expenses.  Applicant was advised to set aside funds for his child support payments.  He initially did but used the funds for other purposes.  He has 
made few child support payments since the requirement was imposed over 15 years ago.  He is in arrears for almost the entire amount.  While Applicant states 
he is contesting the paternity of one of the children, he has made little if any effort to challenge paternity and get relief from the payments.  He acknowledges he 
owes for one of the children but he has not even made those payments.  I conclude the loss of employments that was beyond the control of Applicant did not 
hinder his making child support payments.  He has made no effort to make the child support payments.  I conclude Applicant was able to make child support 
payments and did not make a good-faith effort to do so.  He has not mitigated the security concerns under Guideline F for allegation 1.c.</P> 
<P>The government has not established its case under Guideline J.  The Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions that may apply to Applicant's case  are 
Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>); and Directive &para; E1.A10.1.2.2 
(<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses).</EM>  Applicant did not file his 2001federal and state income taxes on time.  Applicant checked with the federal 
tax officials and believed he need not file on time since he expected a refund as he received in past years.  He was confused by the advise from the Internal 
Revenue Service between the requirement to file tax returns on time with the assessment of interest and fees only on taxes that are owed.  There was no 
allegation by the Internal Revenue Service or admission by Applicant of criminal conduct.  There is no indication of a willful failure to file tax returns 
especially since Applicant had previously filed tax returns on time before and after 2001.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Applicant's answer of "NO" to question 38 concerning debts past due over 180 days in the last 7 
years brings the matter under Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel 
security questionnaire</EM>).  Applicant admitted he knew his child support debts were past due over 180 days when he completed his security clearance application.</P> 
<P>The Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions that apply here are Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the 
individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily </EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct 
the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>). Applicant did not tell security investigators he owed child support payments until questioned by the 
agents.  He also told them he was taking steps to have the question of paternity for one of the children resolved.  He did not provide the information voluntarily 
or make a prompt good-faith effort to provide correct information before being confronted with the past due child support debt.  Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns under Guideline E.</P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P>
