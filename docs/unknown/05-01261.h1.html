<P>As a senior enlisted man in the U.S. Navy, Applicant without authorization removed to his personal residence classified materials pertaining to his ship's 
nuclear propulsion system. After being punished through a summary court martial, he was given a general discharge under honorable conditions. While his 
violation of standing procedures was negligent, it was also an isolated event. He has demonstrated a positive attitude toward his security responsibilities, and he 
is unlikely to commit such a violation in the future. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On June 22, 2005, DOHA issued an 
SOR to Applicant regarding facts in his background that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline K (security violations). Specifically, 
the SOR presented a single allegation Applicant had committed a security violation for which he  was prosecuted, then discharged from the U.S. Navy. (SOR &para; 
1.a). Applicant timely answered the SOR, admitted with explanation the allegation, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on September 14, 2005, and I convened a hearing on September 21, 2005.<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented four exhibits (GE 1 through 4), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf and submitted five exhibits admitted 
into the record as AE A - E. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on October 6, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 36 years old and employed by a defense contractor as an instrument test electrician. The contract to which he is assigned supports repair, 
maintenance, and overhaul of systems aboard U.S. Navy nuclear aircraft carriers and submarines. Applicant went to work for his current employer in December 
2002. He transferred to his current assignment in January 2004. Applicant's supervisor, a 30-year company employee, values his work and regards him as a 
reliable employee who is well qualified for his assigned duties. When he transferred to his current position, Applicant was granted an interim clearance, access 
which he exercised without incident until his clearance was revoked pending the outcome of this adjudication.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served in the Navy from February 1990 until November 2002. He left the service as an electrician's mate second class (EM 2; paygrade E-5), but had 
earlier attained the rank of EM1. Applicant was trained to work in the Navy's nuclear power program and served in the reactor departments aboard a cruiser and 
three aircraft carriers. Applicant's last shipboard assignment was to the pre-commissioning unit (PCU) for a new aircraft carrier. He transferred to that 
assignment from another aircraft carrier in October 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personnel in the PCU reactor department were required to pass certain basic proficiency examinations as part of the ship's overall qualifications to put the 
reactor plant into service. Around the time Applicant transferred to the PCU, a cheating scandal occurred in that the answers to one of the qualification exams 
were e-mailed to various electricians, machinist mates, and others in the reactor department. Applicant would have received the information, some of it 
classified, had the sender had his correct home e-mail address. In March 2001, Applicant was among several enlisted members taken to Captain's Mast, but he 
was found not guilty of participating in the cheating conspiracy.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the cheating scandal investigation, Applicant gave his command permission to confiscate and search his personal computer to see if he had received any 
of the aforementioned e-mails. An initial examination yielded nothing incriminating. However, after the Captain's Mast, his commanding officer wished to 
resolve discrepancies between what Applicant had said and what other accused had said about the misuse of classified information from the exams. Applicant 
agreed to a second, more expansive search of his belongings, including a search of his home. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2001, this second search produced several documents related to in-rate training and reactor qualifications Applicant had taken with him when he left 
his previous command. The materials discovered consisted of 93 pages of training materials, systems diagrams, qualification checklists and signature pages, and 
handwritten notes Applicant had collected during his nuclear power training and onboard qualification studies. About 15 pages of the materials in Applicant's 
home were classified, and Applicant was not authorized to have the materials in his possession outside his command. Other materials, although themselves not 
classified, were taken from a classified document or publication. The majority of the materials were marked as "Unclassified - Navy Nuclear Propulsion 
Information (U-NNPI)," and were also subject to restrictions in use and dissemination.<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Over the next year, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigated the details and impact of the unauthorized removal from of these documents. 
The Navy determined Applicant's actions did not result in any adverse impact on national security; however, based on the results of that investigation, 
Applicant was charged with violating Article 92 (Failure to Obey an Order or Regulation), Article 121 (Larceny and Wrongful Appropriation), and Article 134 
(General Article)  of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). To avoid trial on these charges at a special court-martial, Applicant agreed to plead guilty 
to a single violation of Article 92 at a summary court-martial. On August 19, 2002, he was reduced in rank to E-5, and restricted to the ship for 45 days. On 
September 9, 2002, his commanding officer recommended Applicant be administratively separated from the Navy and given a general discharge under 
honorable conditions. Applicant was so discharged on November 8, 2002, and he was required to repay a large portion of the monetary re-enlistment bonus he 
received when he signed up for another 5-year tour in February 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledges he was well-trained in proper safeguarding, storage, and handling procedures for classified information. He insists he was unaware the 
materials he took with him from his previous command contained classified materials, but he admits he did intend to take with him materials that would help 
him get a head start on his qualifications when he reported aboard the PCU. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Statements taken for the summary court martial from officers and senior enlisted who worked with Applicant at the PCU and at his previous command reflect a 
dedicated, responsible senior enlisted man who was willing to help junior shipmates in their studies to attain their shipboard qualifications. An officer for whom 
Applicant worked while the investigation was pending, noted Applicant's professionalism and honesty. He also recounted an incident where Applicant had 
reported a security violation after classified materials were mishandled.<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant was generally rated as the #1 or #2 petty officer in his previous and the PCU 
reactor department assignments. Aside from this incident, Applicant's Navy career was devoid of anything other than conscientious, reliable, and 
knowledgeable performance. He held the Enlisted Surface Warfare Specialist (ESWS) qualification, received his third Good Conduct Ribbon in January 2000, 
and was named the PCU Reactor Department Sailor of the Quarter for the first three months he was aboard that command. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To that end, the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Security clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guideline to be applied here is Guideline K 
(security violations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern addressed under Guideline K</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is that noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, 
willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Available information consisting of exhibits from both parties, as well as Applicant's own 
statements and admissions, supports the single allegation (SOR &para; 1.a) that Applicant, without authorization, removed to his residence classified information.  
Applicant was punished by the Navy under the UCMJ and his Navy career was ended prematurely because of his actions. On the facts presented herein, 
Guideline K disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. Specifically, Applicant's conduct was negligent in that he was a senior enlisted man with more than 10 
years experience in handling and safeguarding the information in question. I accept Applicant's claim he was unaware the materials he removed from his 
previous command included classified and other protected materials. However, the issue here is whether he exercised a sufficient degree of care when handling 
his working papers and training materials. He clearly did not and was properly held accountable for his actions through a summary court-martial and 
administrative separation with a general discharge.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have also reviewed the Guideline K mitigating conditions (MC) and conclude MC 2<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 4<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply here. Taking into account all of the available 
information about Applicant's Navy and civilian careers, MC 2 applies because this is the only instance of this sort of conduct by Applicant. As to MC 4, from 
January 2004 until June 2005, Applicant held without incident interim access to classified information in his civilian job until the SOR was issued. While 
temporarily assigned to another command as he awaited the outcome of the NCIS investigation in 2001 and 2002, Applicant reported a security violation. I 
have considered the vigor with which the Navy addressed Applicant's actions, the fact he has taken responsibility for his actions, the testimony of his supervisor 
regarding Applicant's reliability, and the positive statements from officers and senior enlisted personnel at Applicant's court-martial. Taken together with 
Applicant's candor about what happened and his apparent sincerity at hearing, I conclude Applicant has a deep appreciation for the gravity of his 
responsibilities should he be granted another security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. 
A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="05-01261.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> of Applicant's conduct in the context of all of the other information before me shows that, while Applicant's security 
violation was negligent and a clear violation of his security responsibilities and as a senior enlisted man, he is not at risk to repeat this conduct. The punishment 
already inflicted on him, his subsequent demonstrations of adherence to security procedures, his overall on-the-job performance in military and civilian 
classified environments, and the clearly isolated nature of this event all serve to satisfactorily resolve any doubts the government may have about his suitability 
to hold a clearance. On balance, I conclude Guideline K for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
