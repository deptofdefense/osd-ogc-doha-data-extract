<P>Applicant was arrested four years ago and charged with aggravated battery, false imprisonment, and shooting into a building. The charges stemmed from a 
single domestic dispute with his wife. Through a plea agreement, he completed court-ordered domestic violence awareness and anger management training. In 
turn, the weapons and imprisonment charges were dismissed and adjudication was withheld as to the battery charge. He has had no other arrests, domestic 
problems, or other adverse conduct. An allegation of deliberate falsification of his security clearance application is unsubstantiated by the record. His criminal 
conduct is not recent, was an isolated event, and is mitigated through clear evidence of rehabilitation. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance.  On May 19, 2004, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and 
Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely answered the SOR (Answer), admitted the allegations of criminal conduct, but denied the allegations of 
adverse personal conduct; to wit, that he deliberately falsified his answers to two questions in his security clearance application (SF 86). Applicant also 
requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on September 1, 2004, and I convened a hearing October 7, 2004.<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented four exhibits (GE 1 through 4), which were admitted without objection. Applicant proffered his testimony and that of his wife in support of his case. 
DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on October 19, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 49 years old and employed as a production manager by a defense contractor for whom he has worked for over 27 years. He has been married for 
more than 20 years, and the couple has two teenage children, one of whom is in college.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife have had a generally happy and stable marriage. She is a school teacher, and he is active in the community, enjoys do-it-yourself 
projects, and golfs in his spare time. Save for the event at the center of this case, Applicant has not engaged in any adverse or questionable behavior.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Late the night of April 9, 2000, Applicant and his wife were driving home from a party. They got into an argument about the fact Applicant's wife had been 
smoking in their car, something that Applicant could not tolerate. Their argument continued after they arrived home and escalated into a physical confrontation. 
Applicant grabbed, shoved, and hit his wife. As she hid in their bathroom, he produced a .22 caliber pistol and threatened to kill his wife with it. After grabbing 
and shoving her  again, Applicant fired a shot away from his wife into a bathroom wall to frighten and intimidate her.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife then fled the house and drove around their neighborhood into the early morning hours looking in vain for a police officer. She eventually came 
home and the couple spent the rest of the night in separate rooms. The next morning, more words were exchanged. Applicant again threatened to kill his wife, 
but left the house shortly thereafter. His wife then went to a police station and filed a criminal complaint against her husband. He turned himself in later that day 
and was jailed for two days. After being released, he and his wife separated for about three months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was initially charged with the felonies of aggravated assault, domestic battery, shooting into a building or vehicle, and false imprisonment. Through a 
plea agreement entered into on August 2, 2000, Applicant pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of battery; however, adjudication was withheld pending 
completion of 12 months probation and a court-ordered 26 week domestic violence / anger management class. The remaining charges were entered as <EM>nolle 
prosequi</EM>. Applicant was also ordered to permanently forfeit his firearm. He completed the terms of his sentence without incident. Applicant and his wife have 
long since resolved their difficulties in this regard.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted an SF 86 on April 25, 2001. In response to question 21</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and question 22,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant omitted his arrest the previous year. However, in 
response to question 26,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant listed an arrest for a "domestic dispute; no adjudication." His understanding, based on advice of his criminal defense 
attorney when Applicant was completing the SF 86, was that one result of the plea agreement was that no felony or firearms charges were actually entered. This 
understanding is wrong, in that it appears from GE 3 that the charges were made but later amended or dropped as part of the plea agreement. Applicant is an 
intelligent man with a sound educational background and a wealth of experience in his field, but he has no formal legal training.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E 
(personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant 
possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with 
the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline J is that a person who is willing to disregard the law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to disregard rules 
and regulations governing the protection of classified information.<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In some cases, the criminal activity may consist of a single serious crime. The government 
has established a case for disqualification by presenting sufficient evidence to support the allegation in SOR &para;1.a, that Applicant was arrested and charged with 
the felony offenses of aggravated battery and domestic violence, false imprisonment, and firing into a dwelling. On these facts, Guideline J disqualifying 
condition (DC) 1<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant's conduct is the only such instance in his background. The record shows this as an anomaly in the life of a solid citizen whose personal 
and professional backgrounds are more fairly characterized as stable, reliable, and productive. Further, this conduct occurred nearly five years ago. Applicant 
turned himself in to the police at the time, taking full responsibility for his conduct, and he successfully completed the terms of his sentence. Applicant also 
appears to have better insight into how to manage his anger as a result of the court-ordered training. In light of the foregoing, Guideline J mitigating condition 
(MC) 1,<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> MC 2,<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 6<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply, and I conclude this guideline in favor of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">n applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government's concern stems from Applicant's alleged falsification of his SF 86. The government has established that Applicant did not 
correctly answer SF 86 questions 21 and 22. The record shows he was charged with offenses that are clearly contemplated by both questions and that he should 
have disclosed them. However, for his omissions to be disqualifying under Guideline E, his answers must have been made with an intent to deceive or mislead 
the government about information relevant and material to the government's need to accurately assess Applicant's suitability for clearance.<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record here does not support a conclusion that Applicant acted with intent to deceive the government when he filled out his SF 86. First, he disclosed in 
response to question 26 that he had been arrested for a domestic dispute. Second, Applicant's testimony about what his former attorney had told him of the 
effect of the plea agreement, combined with the court records<A HREF="03-10272.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> of the disposition of the charges against him support Applicant's claim he believed he had not 
been charged with a felony or a firearms offense. The fact he was wrong is irrelevant to whether he intended to mislead the government on this point. As a 
layman with no formal training in the law, it is reasonable that he may not have fully appreciated the legal significance of his SF 86 answers. At any rate, the 
evidence as a whole on this point tends to support his claim he did not intentionally withhold information from the government. As no Guideline E 
disqualifying conditions can be applied here, I conclude this guideline for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the available evidence, and I have applied the appropriate disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Further, I have tried to make a 
fair and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. This record initially raises reasonable doubts about 
Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government 
entrusts its interests. However, the record also supports a conclusion he has mitigated those doubts and has overcome the government's case.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
