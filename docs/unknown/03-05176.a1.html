  Given the record evidence in this case, it was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application was not mitigated by his subsequent disclosure of his history of marijuana use.  The federal government need not wait until a person commits  a security violation before it can decide to deny or revoke access to classified information.  Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application provides a rational  basis for the Judge's unfavorable decision.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated November 4, 2003, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct).  Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr. issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated May 17, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application was 
not mitigated; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because there is no evidence 
that Applicant ever committed a security violation.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding Applicant's falsification of a security clearance application was not mitigated</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found 
that Applicant falsified a security clearance application in September 2001 by denying any use of illegal drugs, even though he had used marijuana from 1970 to August 
2001 (including use of marijuana after he had been granted a security clearance).  On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge's finding of falsification.  However, 
Applicant contends the Judge should have concluded his falsification was mitigated because he disclosed his marijuana use in an interview with a federal agency.</P> 
 
<P>As noted earlier in this decision, there is no presumption of error below and the appealing party has the burden of demonstrating such error.  The Administrative Judge 
specifically considered the facts and circumstances of Applicant's disclosure of his marijuana use to a federal agency and concluded that they did not mitigate Applicant's  
falsification of the security clearance application.  Considering Applicant's appeal argument in light of the record evidence in this case, the Board concludes Applicant has 
not demonstrated the Judge's reasoning is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because there is no evidence that Applicant ever 
committed a security violation</SPAN>.  Applicant also argues that he has not committed any security violations, and that shows he can be trusted to handle classified information 
properly.  This argument fails to demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 
U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  The federal government need not wait until a person commits a security violation before it can decide to deny or revoke access to classified 
information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  The government can make an unfavorable security 
clearance decision on other grounds that reflect adversely on an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Falsification of a security clearance application 
raises serious questions about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and provides a rational basis for an unfavorable security clearance decision.  <EM>See, 
e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-12329 (December 18, 2003) at p. 4 (discussing security significance of falsification).  Accordingly, Applicant's falsification of a security 
clearance application provides a rational and sufficient basis for the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision, even in the absence of any evidence 
that Applicant has ever committed a security violation.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision.</P>
