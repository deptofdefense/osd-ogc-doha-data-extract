<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant with history of sexually assaulting his minor stepdaughter was charged in two indictments in 1999 with multiple counts of sexual assault, and a single 
count of aggravated sexual assault against a minor.  He pleaded guilty and was granted deferred adjudication and  ten (10) years of supervised probation that 
included testing, avoidance of his children without the permission of the court or his spouse, and fines.  While he has made good progress with his court-referred treatment counselor, he leaves too many recurrence doubts to make safe predictions he can be entrusted to avert any recurrent sexual misbehavior with 
his stepdaughter. More seasoning of Applicant's  commitments to avoid any future sexual misbehavior is required before he be safely entrusted to access 
classified information.   Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 31, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked</SPAN>.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on July 5, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on August 1, 2002, and was 
initially scheduled for hearing on August 21, 2002, before being rescheduled for September 11, 2002.  A hearing was convened on September 11, 2002, for the 
purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, 
the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on six witnesses (including himself) and four exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the 
proceedings was received on September 19, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the hearing</SPAN>, Applicant requested the record be kept open to permit him  to supplement the record with a CV from his sex offender therapist 
(therapist) and additional testing materials used and relied on by Applicant's therapist in evaluating Applicant.  Department Counsel having no objections, and 
for good cause shown, Applicant was afforded seven days after the hearing to supplement the record.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Applicant's September 18 post-hearing submissions</STRONG></P> 
<P>Within the time permitted, Applicant provided a copy of his therapist's CV.  Along with the CV (item 1), Applicant also furnished copies of (2) an IPT journal 
article, assessing violent recidivism in sexual offenders, (3) a key reference to studies on violence prediction and risk analysis, (4) an article entitled "Static  99: 
Improving Actuarial Risk Assessments for Sex Offenders 1999-02," and (5) an articled entitled "Approaches to Offender Risk Assessment: Static v. Dynamic."  
Each of these submissions, save for the therapist's CV, is objected to by Department Counsel for lack of relevancy and absence of availability of the authors for 
cross-examination or voir dire.  Applicant counters that each of these submissions cover actuarial testing data that was used and relied on by Applicant's 
therapist at hearing and are relevant to weighing the therapist's evaluations, opinions, and risk assessments of Applicant as a probationer. </P> 
<P>Because these materials (grouped 2-5 above) were covered in the therapist's admitted evaluation of Applicant (ex. C), they are not subject to automatic 
exclusion by reason of the unavailability of the authors.  Applicant is correct on this score.  <EM>Daubert v. Merrill Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </EM>113 Sup. Ct. 2786, 
2795 (1993) creates gate-keeping responsibilities for the courts that require pre-admission assessments of the proffered materials for scientific validation and  
likelihood of the materials assisting the trier.  The admitted therapist's evaluation did include testing of Applicant on static risk factors, which Applicant scored 
a zero.  Because the therapist accorded considerable weight to this static risk score to predict low actuarial probability of Applicant's being arrested on a sexual 
or violent offense in the future, the materials would have some relevance to the therapist's admitted evaluations of Applicant.  Their weight does not promise to 
be very high, however, in view of the very limited predicate of the Static 99 test: convictions.  Security clearance determinations covering both criminal and 
sexual behavior are not limited to convictions, but encompass proven conduct, irrespective of whether there has been a conviction, or even a charge.  <EM>Cf. 
</EM>DISCR OSD No. 99-0382 (May 3, 2000).   For this reason, the materials that include extensive coverage of the predictive benefits of static testing are of very 
limited use to appraising Applicant's recidivism risks under a clearly consistent with the national interest barometer.  </P> 
<P>Under the more flexible admission standards of this administrative proceeding, which doesn't include subpoena authority, Applicant's proffered items 1through 
5 are admitted as exhibits E through I.  Note is made that Applicant was not tested by his therapist for dynamic (or changeable) risk assessment, which by itself 
would make any consideration of dynamic risk assessment of little probative value.  Further diminishing any relevancy of dynamic risk assessment studies 
(represented by item 5) is the reported absence of any known incorporation of dynamic risk factors into sexual recidivism risk scales.   </P> 
<P><STRONG>Applicant's September 20, 2002 submissions</STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant requested post-hearing admission of a second set of materials by a second proffer made on September 20, 2002.  While they are technically outside 
the seven day period afforded Applicant to supplement the record, they are admitted for good cause.  Applicant correctly claims it was not made clear in the 
record as to whether a calendar period was to be used for computing the seven day period.  Were weekends excluded, Applicant's submissions would have been 
timely, and the materials are accepted herein as timely.</P> 
<P>Applicant's second set of items proffered for admission (items 6 through 8) are objected to by Department Counsel for similar reasons tendered in connection 
with Applicant's first set of items: relevance, foundation and lack of scientific validation.  Specifically, Applicant seeks the submission of (item 6) a report of 
penile plethysmograph assessment of Applicant, (item 7) a MnSOST-R score recording sheet of Applicant, and (item 8) a scoring explanation for Static-99 
testing of Applicant.  Because items 7 and 8 were scored by Applicant's therapist and included in his risk assessment of Applicant (ex. C) they survive <EM>Daubert 
</EM>gate screening and may be admitted (exs. K and L) for the appropriate weight they deserve.</P> 
<P>Admission of item 6, however, is a bit more complicated.  Item 6 covers a report of penile plethysmograph assessment, which Applicant's therapist never 
scored.  Part of Department Counsel's objection to exhibit C at hearing was predicated on the acknowledged absence of interviewing and scoring of the test and 
the absence of the therapist from the hearing where he could be cross-examined on his findings and impressions (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 49-52).  Exhibit C was admitted 
over Department Counsel's objections for the weight it deserved, subject to specific striking of any references to successful polygraph results (<EM>see </EM>R.T.,at 49-51).  Like the polygraph testing Applicant's therapist utilized in evaluating Applicant's deferred adjudication claims, penile plethysmograph testing may be a 
helpful tool in making probation assessments for the supervising court.  It may not be appraised in the same way, however, in making evidentiary findings in 
either a court or administrative hearing governed by court-circumscribed rules of evidence.  Because Applicant does not establish either the relevancy of the 
plethysmograph test to assessing his recidivist risks or the scientific validity of the test in his post-hearing submissions, this item must be excluded.  Any 
probative value the test might have to appraising the evaluation of Applicant's therapist (considering both the materials and the arguments pro and con by the 
parties) is concluded  to be outweighed by the danger of prejudice and confusion.  <EM>See</EM> <EM>United States v. Powers, </EM>59 F.3d 1460, 1471-72 (4<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1995), <EM>cert. 
denied, </EM>116 Sup. Ct. 784 (1996).  Applicant's requested admission of item 6 (ex. J) is, accordingly, denied.</P>

</P> 
<P>Applicant is an engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a continuance of the security clearance he has held since 1989 (<EM>see</EM> ex. A; R.T., at 17, 56).</P> 
<P><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is alleged to have been indicted in March 1999 and charged with aggravated assault of a child under 14 on or about July 15, 1997 and three counts of 
sexual assault of a child under 17 on or about July 15, 1997, for which he pleaded guilty, was granted deferred adjudication for 10 years, beginning in August 
1999, and was placed on probation on conditions that he must register with the State as a sexual offender on a quarterly basis, report to the Community 
Supervision and Corrections department monthly, take yearly polygraph exams, a drug/alcohol evaluation, and bi-monthly drug tests, consume no alcoholic 
beverages,  possess no guns, have no contact with any  minor absent presence of his wife, provide a DNA sample and receive "Sex Offender Treatment" on a 
weekly basis for three years, in addition to paying a $500.00 fine and court costs.</P> 
<P>Additionally, Applicant was indicted in March 1999 for identical sexual assault charges arising out of sexual assault of a minor on or about October 8, 1998, to 
which he pleaded guilty, was granted deferred adjudication for 10 years, beginning in August 1999, and placed on the same probation terms as he was placed in 
connection with his guilty plea to charges arising out of his July 15, 1997 sexual offenses.</P> 
<P>For his response, Applicant admitted the allegations while denying the security concerns associated with the conduct under both Guideline J (criminal conduct) 
and Guideline D (sexual behavior).</P> 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a highly educated mechanical engineer for his defense contractor, where he has held numerous assignments over the course of his twelve plus years 
with the company.  He has a wife and three children: a daughter (B) aged 11, born to Applicant and his wife (C), and two stepchildren, one (A) a stepdaughter 
aged 18 and a stepson aged 16 (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 17, 55-56).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between July 1997 and October 1998, Applicant engaged in sexual activity with his stepdaughter, who was only 14 years of age when Applicant first initiated 
the activity.  His actions consisted of touching and fondling A in her private areas, but did not include sexual intercourse.  Altogether, Applicant's sexual 
assaults on his minor stepdaughter occurred approximately six times over a fifteen month period spanning July 1997 and October 1998.  At A's urging, 
Applicant ceased his sexual abuse of her: His last encounter with her was in September 1998.  When she advised him she wanted to stop, Applicant accepted 
her entreats, acknowledged his responsibility and promised to get her counseling and  help.  However, neither A nor Applicant informed C at the time of their 
sexual activities.  Still hoping to put the activities behind him, he made the choice not to report his  activities with A to either his wife or his company's FSO 
(<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 63-64, 83-84).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Instead of seeking counseling, A reported Applicant's sexual advances to friends at school, who, in turn, reported their conversation with A to school 
counselors (<EM>see</EM> exs. 1 and 3).  A's school counselors, in turn, contacted the local child protective services, who proceeded to invite Applicant and his spouse to 
a meeting to discuss the reports (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1; R.T., at 25).  A meeting between child protective service representatives, Applicant and C was conducted in January 
1999.   When first told of A's reports, C expressed surprise and discounted the reports (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 25-26, 79, 83).   Once Applicant acknowledged them to be 
true, C accepted them.  Armed with Applicant's admissions, child protective services turned the information over to police.  The reports and admissions 
resulted in separate indictments being returned against Applicant in March 1999: the first covering the initial 1997 assault (charged as aggravated sexual assault 
on a minor) and the second covering Applicant's last reported activity in October 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not immediately report his activities with A to his company FSO.  Only after  he was charged by police with sexual offenses against A (in January 
1999) did he report the charges to his FSO (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  When questioned about details of the criminal charges by his FSO, he claimed to have no idea what "the 
basis of the complaint was all about" (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  His claims he withheld details of the charged activities on advice of counsel are credible and accepted.  Since 
pleading guilty to the charges in August 1999, he has informed both his direct supervisor and most of his coworkers of the charges and his guilty pleas.  
Applicant's full disclosure assurances are corroborated and are accepted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant pleaded guilty in August 1999 to each of the indictment charges covering his sexual assaults of his stepdaughter.  The court receiving his guilty pleas 
deferred adjudication and placed him under supervised probation for a period of ten (10) years beginning in August 1999, subject to numerous conditions: 
registration with the State as a sexual offender on a quarterly basis, report to the community supervision and corrections department monthly, submission to 
annual polygram and drug/alcohol evaluation, bi-monthly drug testing, avoidance of alcoholic beverages and possession of firearms, avoidance of contact with 
any minor without his wife being present, providing a DNA sample when requested, weekly acceptance of sex offender treatment for three years, and payment 
of court-ordered fines and court costs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was, in turn, referred by the court to S (a forensic therapist specializing in the assessment and treatment of adult sex offenders) in August 1999.  S is a 
state certified sex offender therapist who is a licensed master social worker and advanced clinical practitioner, with considerable experience in treating sex 
offenders (<EM>see</EM> ex. E).  As a part of his treatment plan for applicant, S asked for and received a sexual history from Applicant.  Additionally, Applicant submitted 
to a clinical polygraph examination to verify his truthfulness to S.  S's interpreted results of the polygraph examination are inadmissible in these administrative 
proceedings and are stricken from S's report.  Applicant was then administered two tests to assess his recidivist risks.  Both tests (according to S's report) 
revealed low recidivist risks (<EM>see</EM> exs. C, K and L).  Because these tests relied on conviction data and not admitted or proven criminal/sexual misconduct, they 
are considerably lacking in materiality to security clearance issues and must be severely discounted.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">S also administered a penile plethysmograph to Applicant (as a part of his treatment program).  S never scored Applicant's plethysmograph checklist, however, 
and as a result, any favorable opinions tendered by S on this test are necessarily excluded from probative consideration.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By all accounts, Applicant successfully completed his three-year treatment program with S.  S found no indication in either his treatment or testing for arousal 
with adolescent females that would suggest anything more than a low risk of recurrent sexual abuse to any other sex or age group of minors (ex. C), while 
cautioning that any sexual re-offending would most likely be limited to an adolescent female closely related to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's probation conditions include restrictions on Applicant's living with or even visiting any of his children without either court approval or permission 
of his wife.  A is now  18 years of age and  residing with her natural father.  Until otherwise indicated by the supervising court, Applicant is ineligible to return 
to his family until his probation is lifted, a process that still has over six years to run its course (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 66).  During the balance of his probation, Applicant 
will continue to be subject to annual polygraph tests, quarterly registration as a sex offender, annual drug and alcohol evaluations, avoidance of alcohol and 
firearm possession, and each of the other court-imposed conditions during his probation, which he has complied with to date without any problems (<EM>see </EM>R.T., at 
38-39, 65-66).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When around his natural daughter B (now 11), Applicant is careful to avert any recurrence of his problems with A.  Because he made sexual advances on his 
stepdaughter before, he wants to  be very sure he has no inclination to treat H in any similar fashion (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 67-68).  As with A, Applicant never visits or 
sees B without his wife's being in their presence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife continue, as they have from the beginning of Applicant's acceptance of A's sexual assault charges, participated in marriage counseling.  
They have a speaking relationship with each other and the children.  Applicant continues to work on reconciliation with his wife and the children over the 
incidents with A (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 44-45).  Applicant and his wife (C) share the hope that someday Applicant will be able to return to their home.  C assures she 
would report any probation violation by Applicant; to date, however, she has had no cause to (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 80).  She  trusts Applicant to adhere to his probation 
rules and avoid placing any of the children in any more pain or jeopardy.  S joins with Applicant's supervisor and coworkers in corroborating Applicant's  deep 
remorse for his assaults of A.  Applicant remains his family's primary means of support, even while living apart from his family.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by his direct supervisor and many of his coworkers who are aware of his sexual transgressions with his stepdaughter.  They recount 
Applicant as truthful and possessed of a good reputation in the community.  Neither Applicant's direct supervisor nor close associates with knowledge of 
Applicant's sexual activities with A perceive him to pose such a security risk.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering DOHA 
cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance 
should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the 
Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P>

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Concern: </EM>Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant comes to these proceedings with a meritorious professional record and no criminal history before his March 1999 indictments for sexual assault 
(including aggravated assault) of his stepdaughter over a fifteen month period spanning July 1997 and October 1998.   Applicant's charges and ensuing deferred 
adjudication and accompanying ten year probation raise security concerns about his judgment and reliability under Guideline J (criminal conduct) and Guideline 
D (sexual behavior).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>That a highly educated and regarded engineer devoted to his wife and children could also abuse his young stepdaughter carries both psychological and ethical 
dilemmas in determining Applicant's clearance suitability.  On one side is  a dedicated engineering professional who has held a security clearance for most of 
the 13 years he has spent with his current employer without the slightest hint of compromise, laxity or permitted threat of blackmail.  In juxtaposition to this 
professionally accomplished and devoted family head is a father who sexually abused his minor stepdaughter with whom he is involved  in perhaps the most 
sacred and endearing trust relationship of all: The one that envelops a father and his daughter or stepdaughter (as here).</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Department Counsel claims that Applicant's praiseworthy civilian record cannot overcome fundamental questions of doubt over Applicant's trustworthiness in 
the face of his repeated breaches of trust with A.  Department Counsel's claims  have merit.  Both the courts and our Appeal Board have historically drawn 
broad lines of nexus to an applicant's non-official conduct and his executing his official duties in reliable and trustworthy fashion.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Cf</SPAN>. DISCR OSD No. 90-1803 (March 31, 1992); DISCR OSD No. 87-2107 (October 30, 1991); <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">accord</SPAN>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Stanek</SPAN> v. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Department of Transp.</SPAN>, 805 F.2d 1572, 1577 (Fed.

<P>Applicant's conduct (sufficiently proven in this case despite deferred adjudication) raises sufficient moral and trust questions about his overall character to be 
security significant.  The parental-child bond fixes firm responsibilities on the parent to care and protect his children.  Public policy has never countenanced a 
parent's divesting his responsibilities or relinquishing his care.  Children look to their parents for physical and emotional sustenance.  Applicant's actions 
betrayed the presumed trust placed in him to protect his children, both his own and those for whom he assumed parental responsibility.  Even an appreciative 
Government cannot look away from his serious breaches in respect and tribute to his many civilian contributions to the nation's defense effort.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant's covered activities invite consideration of various disqualifying conditions under both the criminal conduct and sexual behavior  guidelines of the 
Directive. His sexual breaches involved aggravated and sexual assault, felonious conduct covered by both DC 1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct, 
regardless of charges) and DC 2 (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) of the criminal conduct guidelines.  His actions are also covered by DC 1 
(sexual behavior of a criminal nature) and DC 3 (sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress) of the sexual 
behavior guidelines.  Considering the length of time of the covered activities and the still relatively recency of the conduct (within 5 years), DC 4 (sexual 
behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment) warrants some bearing on the risk assessment associated with Applicant's 
activities as well.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>While Applicant provides few extenuating circumstances to weigh in his favor, he does bring a developing record of mitigation.  His exemplary civilian record, 
his efforts in accepting court-referred treatment with S, his expressed remorse, and his efforts to come to grips with his transgressions and begin the long, 
difficult  process of reconciliation with his wife and children, provide positive evidence of mitigation and are encouraging.  Helpful to his rehabilitation, too, are 
his shown openness and candor with his company supervisor and coworkers.  Whether Applicant is presently entitled to the Government's full trust and 
confidence is less than clear on the record presented.  The low risk assessment by his court-referred treatment counselor is of very limited value because of the 
still active debate on the relative value of actuarial testing over clinical diagnostic assessments by qualified mental health providers.  S's findings are further 
undercut by the very limited information data that was used by S in administering the static and MnSOST-R screening tests.  Both appear to rely on charges and 
convictions that rule out consideration of probative conduct that doesn't reach the courts.   So, while Applicant has successfully completed his court-ordered 
treatment program and made a positive low risk impression on his court-referred treatment counselor, Applicant continues to face almost seven years of 
probation under conditions that preclude him from seeing his children outside the presence of his wife. </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Because of the seriousness of his sexual transgressions and the lengthy probation he faces, Applicant continues to arouse troubling doubts about his ability to 
avert future sexual misconduct.  While his treatment counselor suggests little likelihood of recurrent sexual exploitation of A, he does so sans any visible 
diagnostic qualifications (such as what a board-certified psychiatrist or licensed clinical psychologist would be expected to possess).  Absent any clinical 
diagnostic evaluations to augment the very limited actuarial testing results produced by S, insufficient data exists in the record to make safe predictive estimates 
about Applicant's ability to withstand urges to engage in recurrent sexual misbehavior.  </P> 
<P>Even with a low-risk re-offense assessment from S and Applicant's own assurances, it is difficult to credit Applicant with<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>significant mitigation efforts in the 
face of incomplete input furnished by his counselor.  Neither MC 1 (lack of recency), MC 2 (isolated incident) nor MC 6 (clear evidence of rehabilitation) of the 
criminal conduct mitigation guidelines are available to Applicant on the strength of the information Applicant has provided in mitigation.  Nor may Applicant at 
this time take advantage of any of the mitigation conditions covered by the sexual behavior guideline.  Applicant's conduct not only occurred during his 
adulthood, but it is still relatively recent and subject to court-imposed probation.  The only  mitigating conditions falling under the sexual behavior guideline 
that Applicant may rightly take advantage of are MC 3 (no other evidence of questionable judgment) and  MC 4 (behavior no longer serves as a basis of 
coercion ,exploitation, or duress).</P> 
<P>Overall, Applicant fails to dispel all doubts about his risks of recurrent sexual breaches.  Significant risks still remain about Applicant's recurrence likelihood.  
Weighing the seriousness of the sexual misbehavior against Applicant's imputed duties of trust (gauged both on and off the job), no fair conclusion can be 
reached in Applicant's favor that he has sufficiently recovered from his sexual transgressions (resulting in profound breaches of trust to his stepdaughter) to 
warrant continued entrusting him with access to classified information.  That Applicant presents no cognizable blackmail threat and continues to be held in high 
regard by his supervisor and coworkers are not enough to overcome the collective trust fallout emanating from his abuse of his stepdaughter  and still in-effect 
probation.  More time in rehabilitation in needed by Applicant to make the convincing case of mitigation by showing of successful rehabilitation.  Therefore, 
sub-paragraphs 1.a and !.b of Guideline J and sub-paragraph 1.a of Guideline D are concluded unfavorable to Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>
