<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 23, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 17, 2001, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was 
transferred to the undersigned on November 14, 2001.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 4, 2001.  The hearing was held on January 10, 2001, at 
which the Government presented two exhibits.  The Applicant presented seventeen exhibits.  The Applicant called five witnesses to testify on his behalf.  The 
Applicant also testified on his own behalf.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing exhibit consisting of items 1 and 2.  The official transcript (Tr.) was 
received on January 18, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the live testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 46 years of age, and has a 
Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense 
industry.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born and raised in Germany.  In June 1984, shortly after his first son was born in Germany, the Applicant and his wife, also a German 
national, moved to the United States.  The Applicant immediately took steps to be able to apply for his United States citizenship.  He became a permanent 
resident in April 1988.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Answer to SOR).  He became a citizen of the United States in 1995.  (Tr. p. 64).  The Applicant stated that he severed 
all ties with Germany when he became a United States citizen.  (Tr. p. 65).  The Applicant's youngest son was born in the United States, and is a United States 
citizen. (Tr. p. 77).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's wife and eldest child testified that they are currently in the process of becoming United States citizens.  (Tr. pp. 126 and 115).  The Applicant 
also provided immigration documentation supporting this fact.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Exhibits G, H and I).  His eldest son will be graduating from high school soon, 
and wants to attend a University in the United States.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Exhibit J).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's father, mother and brother are citizens of Germany, and reside there.  His father suffered a stroke in May 2001, and since then has lived in a 
rehabilitation center.  He is immobilized and unable to speak.  He is a retired civil engineer.  His mother is a homemaker.  The Applicant's brother is a research 
engineer for a plastic manufacturing company.  There is no evidence that any of the of the Applicant's family members work for the German government.  The 
Applicant has never served in the German military nor has anyone in his family. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law were German citizens, and resided there.  His mother-in-law has since passed away.  His father-in-law has 
since remarried and still lives in Germany.  The Applicant does not know his father-in-law's wife very well.  Before they retired, his father-in-law was an 
independent sales person with a packaging material company and his mother -in-law was a homemaker.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has traveled to Germany for work related purposes, as well as to visit his family.  On these occasions, he has either attended business conferences 
and/or visited his parents and/or brother.  The Applicant states that he is probably considered the "black sheep" of the family because he has moved to the 
United States.  (Tr. p. 102).  He is not close to his mother, father or brother.  The Applicant has other relatives, such as an uncle and some cousins in Germany, 
but their contact is solely limited to an occasional Christmas or Birthday card.  (Tr. p. 97).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant explained that during his childhood his family made frequent moves within Germany.  He attended several different elementary schools and high 
schools.  He really never established any long running friendships.  (Tr. p. 105).  The Applicant states that he has no friends, and no social or business contacts 
in Germany.  (Tr. p. 85).  The Applicant has established a life for himself and his family in the United States.  He states that he has 100 percent loyalty to the 
United States.  (Tr. p. 85).     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For about twenty years, the Applicant has maintained a life insurance policy and a checking account with an investment portfolio in Germany.   This life 
insurance policy is presently worth at least $80,000.00 euro, worth approximately $68,000.00 in the United States.  By letter dated January 4, 2002, the 
Applicant requested that the life insurance policy be cancelled.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Exhibit D).  A subsequent letter from the life insurance company dated 
January 14, 2002, indicates that the termination of the life insurance policy will become effective February 1, 2002.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).  
With respect to the Applicant's checking account, by letter dated January 4, 2002, the Applicant requested that when the money transfer is received from 
insurance company, the bank will close out the Applicant's account and transfer the closing balance to his bank account in the United States.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's 
Exhibit E).  By a subsequent letter dated January 11, 2002, the bank indicated that the Applicant's stocks were sold that day, and on January 16, 2002, the 
proceeds would be transferred into his bank account in the United States.  (<EM>See</EM>, Applicant's Post-Hearing Exhibit 1).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant owns no property in Germany.  He believes that his mother and her brother own an apartment building, consisting of one office building and four 
housing units.  Although he estimates that the building is worth between approximately $500,000 and $1,000,000 the Applicant does not know for sure what 
the apartment building is worth, or whether he stands to inherit anything.  (Tr. pp. 102-104).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two professional associates testified and provided written statements that collectively indicate the Applicant is a competent, dedicated hard working engineer, 
who demonstrates many professional management skills.  He is considered a person of high integrity, character and loyalty.  He is honest and trustworthy.  (<EM>See</EM>, 
Tr. pp. 23-29, Tr. pp. 40-45, and Applicant's Exhibits A, and B).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A friend and neighbor of the Applicant, with whom he volunteers for community related activities, testified and provided a written statement indicating that the 
Applicant is loyal and trustworthy and has a strong work ethic and a charitable nature.  (Tr. pp. 51-55, and Applicant's Exhibit C).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associates(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with 
respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates that he could possibly be subject to foreign influence may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful 
to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security 
rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record, in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the 
transcript, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign 
contacts have a direct and potentially negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  However, the Applicant has mitigated the concerns.  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has been a citizen of the United States for seven years, since 1995.  He has lived and worked in the United States since 1984, and has assimilated 
into the American lifestyle.  His wife and son are in the process of becoming United States citizens.  They have no desire to return to Germany.  He has no 
foreign contacts, including friends or social associates.  He has no foreign business contacts or any association with the German government.  He is not close 
with his immediate or extended family members, who reside in Germany, and they have no Governmental connections; and as such, I find they exert no foreign 
influence over him.  The Applicant has now resolved his foreign financial interest; and thereby, has also mitigated that allegation.  In conclusion the Applicant 
has no current substantial foreign contacts, or emotional and family ties, in Germany.  The Applicant has demonstrated an unequivocal preference for the 
United States.  Accordingly, Guideline B is found for the Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his foreign influence.  The Applicant has met the mitigating 
conditions of Guideline B and of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of 
persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P>
