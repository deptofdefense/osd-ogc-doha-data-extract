<P>This 55-year-old systems analyst filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on two occasions, in 1996 and 2004.  The first bankruptcy resulted from the breakup of his 
second marriage, which ended in divorce.  The second bankruptcy resulted from his unemployment for a year prior to the bankruptcy.  He has a history of filing, 
but not paying, his state and federal income taxes.  He systematically failed to have enough state and federal taxes withheld from his paychecks.  State tax liens 
have been levied against him in the past and he has had payment plans with the Internal Revenue Service to pay delinquent federal taxes.  He mistakenly 
believed that both his state and federal delinquent taxes were discharged in either bankruptcy.  Applicant has failed to successfully mitigate the security concern 
stemming from his history of not meeting financial obligations.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

on December 21, 2004 and denied all of the allegations.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant denied all of the allegations contained in the SOR.  I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 55 years old and has worked for a defense contractor as a systems analyst since October 2004.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has held security clearances in the past.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He attended the Naval Academy and graduated in 1972.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He served in the Navy from 1968 to 1981 and in the U.S. Navy Reserves from 1981 to 1993.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  In 
1993, he retired from the U.S. Navy Reserves; consequently, he then stopped receiving a monthly salary of $550.  His retirement pay from the U.S. Navy will 
not begin until 2010.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was married twice; both of his marriages ended in divorce.  He divorced his second wife in 1988.  He was ordered to execute an Interspousal Transfer 
Deed.  For no consideration, he transferred his interest in marital real property to his ex-wife.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Also, he was also ordered to pay his second ex-wife $300 per 
month in spousal support, which continues to the present time.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  He was ordered to pay $1,000 per month in child support for his two minor children.  From 
1998 to 2000, the payment was reduced to $500.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  His second ex-wife received almost half of his pay after the divorce.  The expenses from their divorce led to 
his financial downward spiral.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

following:  $4,000 in a lump sum for the purchase of his son's car; $2,000 to $3,000 for a trip and hotel expenses for his family for a week in the summer of 
2000; $3,000 for computer and music equipment for his youngest son; $3,000 for office space for his new career as a salesman.  The rest of the "funds were

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive.  Specifically, these are:  (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the

probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts.  An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards.  The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Based on all the evidence as 
a whole, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 
(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>), apply in this case.  Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt over the past few years.  His delinquent debts 
caused him to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7 twice.  Applicant has a history of financial difficulties with both the state tax authority as well as the IRS; he did 
not have enough state or federal taxes withheld from his paychecks because he needed the money to pay his other financial obligations.  Thus, he incurred 
almost $30,000 in debt related directly to the nonpayment of state and federal taxes.  Moreover, there are three state tax liens filed against him and they appear 
on his latest credit report.<A HREF="03-12155.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He has had payment plans with the IRS  but when he was unemployed for a year in 2003-2004, he ceased payment of those monies 
and he has not followed up regarding any future payments.  Even when he received a financial windfall for approximately $57,000, he did not use any of that 
money to pay his delinquent taxes.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) and find that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>) 
applies in this case.  Based on the record evidence, because of Applicant's financial support to his family after his second divorce and due to Applicant's 
unemployment for one year prior to his second bankruptcy, his accumulation of debts was largely beyond his control.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Moreover, FC MC A6.E2.1.3.1 (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>) does not apply because the existing tax debts remain unpaid.  FC MC A6.E2.1.3.2 (<EM>it was an 
isolated incident</EM>) is not applicable in mitigation because Applicant's two bankruptcies do not qualify as an "isolated incident."  FC MC A6.E2.1.3.6 (<EM>the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay over creditors or otherwise resolve debts) </EM>does not apply because he has not established a good-faith effort to 
repay his overdue taxes.  Once applicant had those delinquent tax debts paid off and behind him, he should be on his way to financial solvency.  His failure to 
take any action to resolve his tax debts fails to substantially mitigate the security concerns.  The evidence does not suggest Applicant's financial problems are 
under control.  Some of his debts have been resolved either through bankruptcy or being paid off and he has mitigated the financial concerns; these debts are 
found in his favor:  &para;&para; 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.p, 1.q, and 1.t.  Thus, other debts have not been paid and the financial concerns for these debts have 
not been mitigated.  These debts are found against him:  &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t.  Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the evidence in this case.  I also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests.  I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns caused by his financial 
considerations.</SPAN></P>
