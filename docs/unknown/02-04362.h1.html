<P>Applicant, a 55-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, has immediate family members who are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  He worked for the Taiwan 
Government for six months while possessing a U.S. security clearance.  He failed to notify his security officer of his move to Taiwan and harbors deep concerns 
for the future of Taiwan.  Applicant failed to sufficiently mitigate foreign preference and foreign influence personnel security concerns, or to demonstrate it is in 
the national interest to grant him a clearance.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor, applied for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), the federal agency 
tasked with determining an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information, declined to grant Applicant a clearance.  In accordance with the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-04362.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-04362.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 19 December 2002 detailing why a clearance was 
not granted and recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the 
SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant failed to meet the foreign preference (Guideline C), foreign influence (Guideline B), and outside activities (Guideline L) 
personnel security guidelines. </P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 11 January 2003, admitting each of the security concerns alleged.  The case was assigned to me on 21 January 2003.  
A hearing was originally scheduled on 19 February 2003.  Due to severe weather, the hearing had to be delayed.  On 20 March 2003, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of two exhibits.  
Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted no exhibits.  A transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on 26 March 2003.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who is employed by a defense contractor as a lead member of the engineering staff.  Ex. 1 at 1, 2.  He

<P>In 1992, the Taiwan representative in the U.S. contacted Applicant about working for a high-tech program in the Taiwan Government.  The contact was 
initiated by one of Applicant's undergraduate professors, who was serving as a director of a Taiwan Government agency, and a former member of the defense 
contractor's staff, who had taken a position as the deputy director of the high-tech program.  Tr. 34, 45.  Applicant went to the office of the Taiwan 
Representative in New York once to discuss the offer.  <EM>Id. </EM> Applicant traveled to Taiwan while considering the offer.  Tr. 41.  Applicant did not report these 
contacts or foreign travel to his facility security officer in the three to four months between the initial contact and Applicant's resignation.  Tr. 37-38.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.  Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 2.  <EM>See </EM>Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. May 9, 
2001).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's 
security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government establishes a prima facie case by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See </EM>Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is in no sense a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline C that Applicant worked at the Taiwan -------- ------------- Office for six months in 1993 and was invited to lecture 
on electrical switching at the -------------------------, Taiwan.</P> 
<P>Under Guideline C, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an individual who acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A3 .1.1.  Performing or attempting to perform duties, or 
otherwise acting, so as to serve the interests of another government in preference to the interests of the United States is a condition that raises security concerns 
and may be disqualifying.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.9.  None of the mitigating conditions listed under Guideline C are relevant or applicable to Applicant's case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence, through Applicant's admissions and the record, that Applicant performed duties and services to help a 
foreign government.  He only returned to the U.S. because he did not think the program was capable of becoming a "full blown" viable industry.  Tr. 52.  
Applicant also expressed an abiding concern for the future of Taiwan.  Applicant has not sufficiently mitigated the security concerns or demonstrated that it is 
in the national interest to grant him a clearance.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's parents, sister, and mother are citizens of and reside in Taiwan; his sister-in-law is a U.S. citizen who resides in 
Taiwan; he has contact with the Director of the scientific program who resides in Taiwan; Applicant worked for the scientific program; and he was invited to 
lecture a scientific technology group of the Taiwan Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or 
obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in 
the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security 
determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following applicable conditions raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.2.l. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Associates who are connected with any foreign government.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.2.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Failing to report, where required, associations with foreign nationals.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.2.4.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following conditions may be applicable in mitigation of those security concerns: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A determination that the immediate family members and associates in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.l.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence the disqualifying conditions alleged in the SOR.  Applicant has family members who are citizens of and 
reside in Taiwan.  He worked for an agency of the Taiwan government.  Furthermore, although he possessed a U.S. security clearance at the time, Applicant 
failed to notify his security officer of his contacts with representatives of a foreign government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The strength of this foreign influence is evident in his decision to accept the position in Taiwan.  Although he mentions wanting to spend some time with his 
mother, Applicant's decision to work for the Taiwan Government agency seems to be a result of cultural obligation.  "And in the Orient when, you know-when 
the college professor or a teacher asks his student to help, it's extremely difficult to refuse."  Tr. 13.  He further professes great concern for the future of Taiwan 
because of the threat of communism.  Tr. 78.  Under the circumstances, Applicant has not sufficiently mitigated the foreign influence security concerns nor 
demonstrated that it is in the national interest to grant him a clearance.  Finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline L-Outside Activities</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's outside employment with the Taiwan Government agency and his speaking engagement with the scientific technology 
group were conflicts of interest that posed security risks.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline L, involvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of security concern if it poses a conflict with an individual's security 
responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A12.1.1.  </SPAN>Any service, whether 
compensated, volunteer, or employment with<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the following pose an applicable security concern and may be disqualifying:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A foreign country.  Directive &para; E2.A12.1.2.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Any foreign national.  </SPAN>Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A12.1.2.2.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These security concerns could be mitigated by the individual terminating the offending employment.  </SPAN>Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A12.1.3.2.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant negotiated a job with the Taiwan Government agency, and worked for it for six months, 
while possessing a U.S. security clearance and without notifying his security officer.  However, the employment has been terminated and there is little 
likelihood of recurrence.  Finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P>Conclusions as to each of the allegations in the SOR as required by Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 3, &para; 7 and the Directive &para; E3.1.25, are as follows:</P>
