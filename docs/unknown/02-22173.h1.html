<P>Applicant accumulated unmanageable debt as a result of her husband's failed business, their subsequent divorce, and his discharging his share of the marital 
debt in bankruptcy shortly after their divorce was final. Applicant paid as much of the debt as she could and discharged the remainder in bankruptcy in 2003. 
She also smoked marijuana on two or three occasions during a weekend in July 2001. She used marijuana on a beach with strangers and recently acquired 
friends. Applicant possessed a security clearance when she used marijuana. Her use of marijuana was detected by a randomly administered urinalysis by her 
employer. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On September 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the 
administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guidelines H, for drug involvement and F, for financial considerations. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was sworn to on October 3, 2003, and requested a hearing.  Applicant denied the allegation contained in 
subparagraph 1a, and admitted all  remaining allegations, making a correction to the month of the alleged marijuana use in subparagraph 1b. Applicant 
explained at the hearing that she denied subparagraph 1a because it contained an incorrect month and was confusing about how many times she was alleged to 
have used marijuana. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to another administrative judge on October 29, 2003, and reassigned to me on November 21, 2003 because of caseload concerns.  A 
notice of hearing was issuedon December 2, 2003, scheduling the hearing for December 16, 2003.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government 
submitted eleven documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-11 and admitted into the record without an objection.  
The Applicant testified at the hearing and submitted three exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-3, and admitted into the record without an 
objection. Applicant also called one witness to testify on her behalf. The transcript was received by DOHA on December 29, 2003.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admission to the allegations contained in subparagraphs 1b &amp; c and 2a of the SOR are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of 
the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 47 years old, divorced, and the mother of an 18-year-old daughter who is a student and lives with her. Applicant was first married in June 1974 
when she was 17 years old. That marriage ended in divorce in January 1976. She remarried in December 1984 and that marriage ended in divorce in March 
2002. She has a bachelor of arts degree in journalism with a minor in Soviet political history. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant has worked for government contractors since approximately 1983. She has held several different positions, including photographer and hazardous 
waste handler. She is presently employed as a hazardous waste operator. She has possessed a security clearance since 1986, at the top secret level from 1986 to 
1997 and at the secret level since that time. There is no evidence that any action has ever been taken to revoke or downgrade her clearance for other than 
administrative reasons or that any complaints or allegations have ever been made against her alleging mishandling of classified material. She also possesses a 
commercial driver's license (CDL). Applicant has no criminal history, with the exception of being made a ward of court for possessing marijuana when she was 
either 13 or 14 years old. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's husband began a business in 1990 that consisted of retail stores selling comics, cards, and collectibles. The business was very successful at first and 
allowed him to open four stores. In either 1994 or 1995, weather and weather related damage to two of the stores, occurring before and continuing through the 
Christmas season, had a severe negative impact on the financial condition of the business. A subsequent downturn in the local economy continued the business 
on an increasing down slide. He acquired a small business administration loan and incurred other debts in failing efforts to make payroll and revive the 
business. Included in the debts he incurred were three credit cards he opened in Applicant's name, without her knowledge, and used to acquire inventory 
through the internet.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's marriage apparently began to fail somewhere around 2000, causing her to separate from her husband in January 2001, and ended with the parties 
obtaining a divorce in March 2002. While her marriage was failing, she also experienced the death of a close aunt in March 2000, her grandmother in June 
2000, and her father in October 2000. She felt "emotionally vulnerable" as a result of these events, and traveled to another state to stay at a vacation 
condominium she and her husband owned in April 2001. During that stay she befriended some new acquaintances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant returned to the condominium in July 2001<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> for the purpose of moving personal effects from there and listing the condominium for sale in 
contemplation of a divorce. While at the vacation location she went surfing, and afterwards sat on the beach with the people she had befriended in April and 
some other persons she did not know. Someone passed around a marijuana cigarette and she used it on one or two occasions. According to GE 2, this conduct 
occurred both on Saturday and Sunday and totaled either three or four times during which she used marijuana. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant returned to work the week following her use of marijuana and was directed to submit to a random urinalysis on July 21, 2003. She tested positive for 
the presence of THC and was suspended from work for ten days. She was also directed to obtain a substance abuse evaluation, which she did on August 2, 
2001. The evidence obtained during that evaluation did not support a diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence. She was recommended to attend a 
drug/alcohol information class, which she completed on August 11, 2001. She was also subjected to six unannounced random urinalysis tests over the following 
12 months, to be followed by two unannounced random tests in the next two years. She is still subject to that testing and has tested negative on all urinalysis 
tests administered since July 2001. The counselor suggested that Applicant disclose her marijuana use to her family, which she did, including her then 15-year-old daughter.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's divorce decree provided that she and her husband were to split all marital indebtedness evenly, including those debts acquired by her husband in the 
pursuit of his business. The marital residence was sold and the proceeds were used to satisfy debts that were secured by liens that had been placed against the 
residence. Applicant used her portion of the proceeds received from the sale of the vacation condominium to satisfy additional debts. She also reached an 
agreement with the three credit card companies on the accounts that had been opened by her husband without her knowledge in the pursuit of his business 
venture and satisfied those creditors. Meanwhile, her husband filed for and received a discharge in bankruptcy, leaving her totally responsible for all the marital 
debts. He also, more or less simultaneously, moved to a foreign country, and she believed he had no intention of returning to the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant consulted an attorney and was advised to file for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. She did so on March 4, 2003, listing $142,000.00 in debt that was 
attributed to business debt of her ex-husband.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant was granted a discharge in the bankruptcy on August 28, 2003. Applicant's recent credit report (AE 
2) and testimony discloses she is presently financially solvent, secure, and that her income satisfactorily exceeds her monthly living expenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guidelines H, 
pertaining to drug involvement, and F, pertaining to financial considerations, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-22173.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H, illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not. 
If they do not respect the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Appellant used marijuana on at least two days in July 2001 while sitting on a beach with strangers and recently acquired new acquaintances. When she used the 
marijuana she worked for a defense contractor and possessed a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse</EM>; and 5:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> . . . . Recent drug 
involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance,  . . . , will almost invariably result in an unfavorable determination </EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is no evidence that Applicant has abused any controlled substance, with the exception of a brief period when she was either 13 or 14 years old, other than 
on the one weekend in July 2001. She received a favorable drug evaluation, successfully completed the recommended drug information class, has expressed an 
intention to never again abuse drugs, and has not been reported as failing any of the random urinalysis tests that were directed. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 2: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event</EM>; 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>; and 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Satisfactory completion of a 
prescribed drug treatment program . . . without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional </EM>apply in this case. Less 
than three years has passed since Applicant's use of marijuana, and she still remains subject to random urinalysis tests as a direct result of that use. Accordingly, 
I do not find MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was not recent </EM>applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM>Applicant, at least implicitly, attributes her use of marijuana to the "emotionally vulnerable"  state she found herself in as a result of the break up of her 
marriage and the deaths of three close relatives. Whatever the cause, her marijuana use on a public beach with strangers and others displayed a serious lack of 
judgment. She knowingly placed herself in a situation where she could have been coerced or exploited based on the risk her indiscretion. Such use of a 
controlled substance, itself displaying a lack of inhibition, also posed the risk of an involuntary disclosure of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Despite the applicability of the several mitigating conditions noted above, I find Applicant's gross disregard of the multiple prohibitions placed upon her use of 
a controlled substance by the criminal law, her employment, possession of a CDL, and possession of a security clearance make it inconsistent with the national 
interest to continue her access to classified information. Guideline H is decided against Applicant.      </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an 
individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving 
responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial problems resulted from her husband's failed business and his filing for bankruptcy shortly after they obtained a divorce. She relatively 
quickly satisfied her personal obligations and those her husband had acquired in her name without her knowledge. She discharged her responsibility for his bad 
business debt in bankruptcy. Applicant is now financially stable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on all the evidence presented in this case, I find that Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>: and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability 
or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply in this case.  I also find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>: and DC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM> apply in this case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has mitigated this security concern.  Guideline F is decided for 
Applicant.  </SPAN></P>
