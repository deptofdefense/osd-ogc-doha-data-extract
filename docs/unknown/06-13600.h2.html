</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On June 30, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="06-13600.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of 
Defense Directive,<A HREF="06-13600.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 20, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me October 11, 2006.  On December 4, 2006, I 
convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government offered two exhibits for admission 
to the record.  The Government's exhibits were identified as Exhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2 and were admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant testified on her own behalf and called no other 
witnesses.  She offered two exhibits for admission to the record.  Applicant's exhibits were identified as Ex. A and Ex. B and were admitted into evidence without objection. On December 12, 2006, 
DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the three allegations.  Her admissions are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 49 years old and never married.  She is currently living with her mother. She  has not previously held a security clearance.  She is a high school graduate and has completed two years of 
study at the college level. (Ex. 1; Tr. 61.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was employed as a lead laborer at construction sites by a government contractor until she suffered a stroke on the job in June 2005.  She has not worked since her stroke and has been 
under a physician's care for high blood pressure and peripheral artery disease in her left leg.  Her physician has advised her to restrict her activity and to rest. ( Tr. 32-33, 38-39, 52-56; 58-59, 64-65.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant receives $185 per month from social services, $135 per month in federal food stamps, and Medicaid.   She pays her mother $100 per month in rent.  Her co-pay for her medications is 
approximately $3.00 per prescription. (Tr. 48-50, 61.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's employer has certified her work requires a security clearance and, provided Applicant received a security clearance, she would be subject to rehire.  Applicant has not communicated 
with her employer regarding her job and her security clearance application since October 2005. (Tr.67, 71.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Applicant had financial delinquencies dating back several years before she suffered the stroke and was unable to work.  She owes a credit card company approximately $987 on a debt placed for 
collection.  (SOR &para; 1.a.)  Applicant acknowledged the debt and stated she had not made any payments on the account for about five or six years.  She also acknowledged she had not made any 
arrangements with the creditor to pay or settle the debt.  (Tr. 42-44.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledged a judgment in the approximate amount of $8,248 that was entered against her in January 2002. (SOR &para; 1.b.)  She stated the judgment resulted from a repossessed 
automobile, and she estimated her last payment on the judgment occurred before 2001. She also stated she had taken no recent action to pay the judgment.  (Tr. 43.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also acknowledged a lien filed against her in July 2002 for approximately $2,194.  She stated the lien was placed against her for failure to pay her state taxes. (SOR &para; 1.c.)   In 2000 and 
2001, Applicant's wages were garnished for a period to pay the lien, and she presented evidence showing a line item on certain pay stubs which she identified as garnished payments on the lien 
totaling $128.94.  She stated she had made no other payments on the lien independent of the garnishments in 2000 and 2001. (Ex. B; Tr. 46-48.)    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nothing in the record indicated Applicant had pursued credit counseling in an effort to resolve her current financial difficulties and to prevent them from recurring in the future. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  
The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security 
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of 
Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being 
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions 
listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, is that individuals who are financially overextended and unable or unwilling to pay their just debts may try to generate 
funds by engaging in illegal acts.  Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, and her financial history suggests an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts, conditions 
which raise security concerns under subparagraphs E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.  DOHA's Appeal Board has concluded that "[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal 
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified information."  ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4  (App. Bd. June 8, 
2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledged approximately $11,400 in unpaid long-standing debts, and she had no plan for paying her creditors.  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established, through Applicant's admissions and the record evidence, a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that Applicant is financially overextended.  Applicant provided no persuasive evidence 
to rebut the financial concerns specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying conditions under &para;&para; E2.A6.1.2.1. and E2.A6.1.2.3. of Guideline F.<A HREF="06-13600.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are several conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Applicant acknowledged three debts that dated back to at least 2002, 
demonstrating that her financial delinquencies are not isolated incidents. These debts remain unsatisfied.  Thus, neither mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.1. nor mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.2. 
applies.<A HREF="06-13600.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If the conditions that resulted in the financial delinquency were largely beyond the person's control-such as loss of employment, a business downturn, an unexpected medical emergency, or a death, 
divorce, or separation-then mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. might apply. The record shows that Applicant suffered a debilitating stoke in July 2005 and has been unemployed and unable to pay 
her debts since that time.  While Applicant's serious health situation is regrettable, the record evidence suggests her financial delinquencies occurred long before her stroke and were within her 
control to pay or settle before July 2005. Applicant's current disability does not explain her past financial difficulties and her inability or unwillingness to meet her financial obligations before July 
2005.  Thus, I conclude mitigating condition E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There was no evidence in the record that Applicant sought counseling for her financial problems.  Nothing in the evidentiary record suggests she has developed and implemented a practical plan for 
resolving debts and avoiding further indebtedness.  Thus, mitigating conditions E2.A6.1.3.4. and E2.A6.1.3.6. do not apply,<A HREF="06-13600.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and the Guideline F allegations in the SOR  are concluded against the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past 
transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.  
Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so, I 
conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in 
Department of Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended.</SPAN></P>
