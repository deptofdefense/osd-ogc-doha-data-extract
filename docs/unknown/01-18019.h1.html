<P>The Applicant was born in Greece and is a dual citizen of the US and Greece. The Applicant's two elderly sisters are citizens of and living in Greece.  His 
sisters are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 5, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-18019.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On November 
2, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 14, 2002, the Applicant received a complete copy of the "File of Relevant Material" (FORM) dated December 19, 2001, and was given the 
opportunity to file objections and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation.  The Applicant responded to the FORM on February 8, 2002.  I was 
assigned the case on February 19, 2002, on which date the record in this case closed.  The Department Counsel presented six exhibits (Items). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges foreign preference (Guideline C) and foreign influence (Guideline B). The Applicant admits some of the allegations and denies the remainder.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 67 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since June 1988, and is seeking a security clearance.  The Applicant was born in Greece.  In 
ay 1977, the Applicant moved to the US and in July 1981, he became a naturalized US citizen.  The Applicant has a US passport and does not have a Greek 
passport.  Since 1981, all of his travel has been on his US passport.  The Applicant believes he holds dual US and Greek citizenship.  He married an American 
citizen and lives in the US. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has two sisters--aged 65 and 68--who are Greek citizens, residing in Greece.  His sisters do not work for the Greek government, have never 
worked for the Greek government, served in the Greek military, nor are they agents of a foreign power.  Between 1993 and 2000, the Applicant traveled yearly 
to Greece to visit his family, staying three or four days per visit. His last visited to Greece was in 2000. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1956, the Applicant graduated from a Greek maritime academy.  From 1957 through 1960, he served in the Greek navy.  Thereafter, he served 18 years with 
the Greek merchant marine, working for Greek commercial companies.  He receives approximately $100.00 per week pension (Item 6, p 2) for his prior service, 
which is deposited into one of his sister's bank account in Greece.  The pension is for his merchant marine service and is not for service with the Greek 
government. (Item 4)  The Applicant's pension represents less than two per cent of his current annual income. (Item 4)  When his parents died, he and his two 
sisters inherited a $65,000.00 house in Greece.  His share of the house is less than three per cent of his net assets. (Item 4)  He does not vote in Greece and has 
never held political officer there.  He has not maintained his foreign citizenship to protect foreign property or financial interests. He has not exercised any 
attribute of his Greek citizenship since emigrating to the US. (Item 4) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Preference (Guideline C)</STRONG>The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, 
then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  1.  The exercise of dual citizenship.  E2.A3.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  E2.A3.1.3.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Influence (Guideline B)</STRONG> The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. 
E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.  E2.A2.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States.  E2.A2.1.3.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, 
mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge 
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  Under Guideline C, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when the person acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the US.  Security concerns over the Applicant's 
possible foreign preference arise from his dual US Greek citizenship. The Applicant believes Greece may consider him a Greek citizen because he was born 
there.  Although foreign law may impose dual citizenship on the Applicant, the Applicant has no control over this.  But greater significance, the Applicant has 
not exercised his Greek citizenship since becoming a US citizen.  Mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="01-18019.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant receives approximately $100.00 per week from a merchant marine pension, which is not a benefit provided by a foreign government.  The 
pension is similar to a retirement from a company which is a reimbursement for his prior employment.  The pension is deposited into his sister's bank account 
in Greece.  Accepting a merchant marine pension is not the same as accepting retirement from a foreign country.  Therefore, disqualifying condition (DC) 4<A HREF="01-18019.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
does not apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, together with his two sisters, inherited their parent's home worth $65,000.00.  His portion of the home represents less than 3% of his net assets.  
Receiving an inheritance--even if it is located in a foreign country--does not show the individual has acted in a way to show a preference for the foreign 
country.  The Applicant does not maintain his foreign citizenship to protect this foreign property or any foreign financial interest.  Owning foreign property 
could raise a concern under Guideline B, Foreign Preference, DC 8,<A HREF="01-18019.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> but mere inheritance does not show a concern under Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  Had 
his partial ownership of the house been alleged under Guideline B, mitigating condition (MC) 5<A HREF="01-18019.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> would apply because his interest is minimal, being less than 
3% of the value of his net assets. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline B, (Foreign Influence).  Under Guideline B, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when the person has immediate family and other persons to whom he is bound by affection are not citizens of the United States, reside in a 
foreign country, or may be subject to duress.  The Applicant's sisters are citizens of and residing in Greece.  Thus, disqualifying condition, E2.A2.1.2.1.<A HREF="01-18019.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden is on the Applicant to demonstrate that these foreign nationals are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power.  The Applicant's two 
sisters--aged 65 and 68--are Greek citizens, residing in Greece.  His sisters do not work for the Greek government, have never worked for the Greek 
government, have never served in the Greek military, nor are they agents of a foreign power.  His ties to his sister present an acceptable security risk.  The 
security concerns engendered by the foreign citizenship of his sisters are mitigated and MC 1<A HREF="01-18019.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. His sisters are not in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.  I find for the Applicant as to 
SOR subparagraph 2.a.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
