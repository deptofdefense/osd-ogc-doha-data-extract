<P>Twenty-five year old Applicant's falsification, omission, and concealment in June 1999, made under certification, on a Security Clearance Application, 
regarding past illegal use of drugs or drug activity, in light of his eventual admission that he had experimented with marijuana during 1995-96, as well as his 
denial of more recent marijuana abuse despite testing positive for marijuana in September 1998, characterized by Applicant as a false positive, constitute 
violations of Federal law, Title 18, United States Code, &sect; 1001, a felony, and raise grave questions and doubts as to his security eligibility and suitability.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 26, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20,1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed 
reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated December 21, 2001, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record, in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on April 2, 2002.  A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM)<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.  He did so on May 13, 2002, when he submitted three letters of reference.  The case was assigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on 
ay 30, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted both of the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.); and criminal conduct 
under Guideline J (subparagraph 2.a.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 25 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and is seeking to obtain a SECRET security clearance.  He was previously granted an interim 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was a substance abuser whose substance of choice was marijuana.  He commenced experimenting with marijuana at some point during his freshman 
year in college, in about 1995, and continued doing so, on approximately 10 to 15 occasions during 1995-96.<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He offered no explanation as to his motivation 
for doing so.  Despite evidence to the contrary, discussed further below, he claimed his most recent substance abuse occurred during that same 1995-96 time-period.  In February 2000, he vowed to abstain from any future illegal drug activity and to do everything in his power to avoid exposure to drug use.<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  However, 
there is substantial evidence to rebut Applicant's contention that he has abstained since 1996.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the period of his marijuana "experimentation," Applicant never manufactured, purchased, transported, or sold the substance,<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and there is no evidence to 
rebut his contentions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1998, Applicant was administered a pre-employment drug test by an employer which had recently hired him on a part-time basis.  He flunked the 
test.<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The examination registered positive for THC (marijuana).  Although he denied having used marijuana prior to the test, and claimed the result was a false 
positive, he chose not to have a re-test performed on the original specimen sample because (1) it would have been too costly to do so,<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and (2) the sample could 
have been tainted and a re-test would be "inconsequential."<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant did admit having been "exposed" to marijuana at that time during social occasions.<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  As 
a direct result of the positive drug test, Applicant was involuntarily terminated by the employer.<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 10, 1999, Applicant completed his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86),<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and in response to an inquiry pertaining to ever ("since the 
age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter") having used a variety of illegal substances, including marijuana,<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Applicant responded "no."  He certified 
that his response was true, complete, and accurate.  It was false.  He had lied, falsified, omitted, and concealed the relevant portion of his true history of 
substance abuse, as described above.  Six months later, in late January 2000, Applicant eventually admitted to an interviewing Defense Security Service (DSS) 
investigator that he had omitted and concealed the truth, and falsified the response.  He attributed his response to a variety of vague justifications:<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<UL> 
  <LI><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he had "regretfully neglected" to disclose the information;</SPAN></LI> 
</UL>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2001, Applicant modified his explanations and also acknowledged deliberately choosing not to admit his marijuana use because he feared his 
claim regarding the false test result would not be believed.  He also expressed regret over not being fully candid in his response to the question.  He  now 
acknowledges his professional career and health can be jeopardized by substance abuse.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed by another Government contractor since about May or June 1999, and was administered a drug test at that time, which he 
passed.<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  His performance has been characterized as outstanding and he has been recognized with several awards and a promotion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>[Personal Conduct - Guideline E]: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>[Criminal Conduct - Guideline J]: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  Because of this special relationship the Government must be able 
to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, 
by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions 
entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline E, the Government has established its case.  Examination of Applicant's actions reveals a pattern of conduct involving questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability.  Initially, he admittedly violated the law, in 1995-96, by abusing an illegal substance.  In September 1998, when 
confronted with the positive results of a drug test, Applicant denied using marijuana at the time.  Subsequently, in June 1999, when required to be truthful 
during the completion of an SF 86, he intentionally lied, and offered a variety of justifications for his action,  and attributed the "false positive" result to a lack 
of accuracy and efficiency in the testing process.<A HREF="01-04395.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> As recently as December 2001, Applicant contended the test was a false positive resulting not from his 
substance abuse but because he had been "exposed" to marijuana during social occasions.  His position lacks credibility.  Also, it is interesting to note when he 
was offered the opportunity to have a re-test of the original specimen, he declined.  In this instance, I have no evidence of unintentional or careless oversight, 
but rather calculated and deliberate omissions of information which Applicant chose not to reveal simply because he felt it necessary to protect his interests.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's ensuing forthrightness regarding his early history of substance abuse, only upon being interviewed by a DSS investigator</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, in late January and early 
February 2000, does not lessen or minimize, much less erase or nullify, the impact of his falsification, omission, and deception.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Applicant's overall questionable 
personal conduct in this regard clearly falls within Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A5.1.2.2., DC E2.A5.1.2.4., and DC E2.A5.1.2.5.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Likewise, while his eventual partial frankness does not qualify as a "prompt, good-faith effort" to correct his falsifications before being confronted with the 
facts under</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A5.1.3.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, it does reveal a positive step to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure, under MC E2.A5.1.3.5.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate, meaningful security clearance 
determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security.  The nature of 
Applicant's actions and activities therefore pose a serious potential risk to the nation's security precautions which go to the very heart of the nation's security 
system.  An applicant's responsibilities associated with the granting of a security clearance are considerable in terms of protecting the national security and in 
maintaining appropriate personal conduct.  Along with the responsibilities is accountability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this instance, while Applicant may be highly regarded by his 
current employer, he is also now accountable for those past actions and activities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I do not take this position lightly, but based on the law, as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, and my 
application of the pertinent factors and conditions under the Adjudicative Process, I believe Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's 
case.  The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the 
SOR are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline J, the Government has established its case.  Statements made by an applicant for access to classified information encompass matters 
within the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense, and are provided under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001. Applicant's explanations for failing to 
accurately relate his correct history of substance abuse simply will not justify or exonerate such actions.  I conclude, therefore, Applicant's felonious conduct 
--misrepresentation, falsification, omission, and concealment (deception) of his substance abuse history, was material and made in a knowing and willful 
manner in contravention of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.  That criminal conduct clearly falls within Criminal Conduct DC E2.A10.1.2.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">None 
of the Mitigating Conditions apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While a person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past, without a clear indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or rehabilitation, 
I am unable to determine with reasonable certainty the probability such conduct will not recur in the future.  Without more, I simply do not believe the period of 
time from the most recent acknowledged falsification--which occurred in June 1999--to the closing of the record, is sufficient to persuade me recurrence of 
such criminal conduct is unlikely.  Consequently, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government`s case.  Accordingly, allegation 2.a. 
of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
