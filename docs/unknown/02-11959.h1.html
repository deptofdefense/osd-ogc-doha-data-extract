<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant has been arrested 12 times between 1970 and 2000. His criminal conduct includes but is not limited to assault, disorderly conduct, and drug 
possession. He also intentionally falsified two security questionnaires in 1984 and 2001 by deliberately omitting information about his arrests and about past

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On November 14, 2002 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR informed Applicant 
that DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security 
clearance.<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges facts which raise security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On January 13, 2003, Applicant through counsel answered the SOR (Answer), wherein he admitted all but two of the allegations and requested a hearing. The 
case was assigned to me on April 18, 2003. On June 2, 2003, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting this case to be heard on July 9, 2003. On July 1, 2003, 
for personal medical reasons, I rescheduled the hearing to July 16, 2003. All parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on July 24, 
2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He seeks a clearance in connection with his duties as an aircraft maintenance worker on his 
company' contract with the U.S. Air Force. He was married for 26 years, but divorced his wife in September of 2000. The couple raised a daughter, now 30-years-old.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I find that Applicant has not been credible at several points during his background investigation and at hearing. In his testimony at hearing, he contradicted his 
earlier sworn, written statements regarding his August 1995 and November 2001 arrests. He was also extremely evasive when questioned about the court-ordered counseling he received after his arrest in August 1995. Further, his allegations of police and investigator misconduct strain credulity. He asserts without 
any substantiation that the police reports of his arrests have been concocted, and that a DSS investigator somehow fabricated one of his written statements about 
past drug use. I do not accept Applicant's position that he has been wronged by law enforcement and investigative agents at virtually every turn when he has 
been involved in some adverse conduct. Likewise, I found his testimony regarding his omissions from his two security questionnaires of arrest and drug 
information to be contradictory and wholly without merit.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been arrested for various acts of criminal conduct 12 times since 1970. In May 1970, when he was 19-years-old, he was charged with assault. 
(SOR &para; 1.a). There is little information available about this arrest or the disposition thereof, but Applicant acknowledged at hearing that he was at a high school 
basketball game when a fight occurred. He was later called to the school and identified as one of the participants in the fight.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On May 18, 1977, Applicant and his wife got into an argument while they were driving together on a road near their house. A police officer attempted to pull 
Applicant over by following Applicant's car and turning on his emergency lights and siren. Applicant failed to stop because "[a]t the time, [he] didn't feel like 
it."<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant decided to drive all the way home with the police officer in pursuit. When Applicant arrived home, he got out of his car and started to walk into 
the house ignoring the police officer's orders to stop. The officer drew his weapon, stopped Applicant and handcuffed him, and placed him in the back seat of 
the police cruiser. Applicant claims the officer struck him with a nightstick while apprehending him. In retaliation, Applicant kicked the officer in the back of 
the head when the officer got into the driver's seat. Applicant was charged with assault and battery, but the charge was later </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle prosequi</EM>. (SOR &para; 1.b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On July 30, 1979, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault. He had an argument with the wife of the maintenance man for the trailer park where 
Applicant lived at the time. She used a racial slur to which Applicant replied with his own profanity. As he was leaving to go home, the maintenance man 
chased after Applicant and threatened him with a garden hoe. Applicant retrieved a loaded shotgun from his trailer and threatened to use it in self defense. Both 
men were charged with assault, but all charges were </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle prosequi</EM>. (SOR &para; 1.c).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On November 27, 1982, Applicant was riding in a car with his brother and another person, when the car was stopped by police. A search of the vehicle revealed 
a small quantity of marijuana in the front seat where Applicant and his brother were seated. The two men were charged with misdemeanor possession of 
marijuana. Applicant pled guilty to avoid the inconvenience of having to return to that jurisdiction for trial. He was placed on probation and ordered to pay a 
small fine. (SOR &para; 1.d).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On June 28, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and disobeying a police officer. Applicant claims that he and his friends had 
done nothing wrong, but that  the police had arbitrarily singled them out for no good reason. He was eventually found not guilty of these charges. (SOR &para; 1.e).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On August 20, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery. He was in an automobile accident either while on his way to a family 
gathering or while he was helping his wife move into an apartment.<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He was thrown from his car, and a woman at the scene tried to render aid to Applicant. 
She was apparently trying to keep him from getting up off the ground when Applicant pushed the woman away, got up and went to make a phone call. 
Applicant explains his actions as due in part to having received heart medication the day before, and consuming a small quantity of alcohol the day of the 
accident. At any rate, when he returned to the scene after his phone call, he was arrested and charged with assault. The charge was eventually placed on the stet 
docket, a procedure in Applicant's jurisdiction which suspends prosecution of minor offenses for a year. Prosecution may be resumed up to a year later if the 
accused is arrested for any subsequent crime.<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He was also ordered to perform community service and attend anger management counseling. (SOR &para; 1.f).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On August 28, 1997, Applicant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and sentenced to probation before judgement a year later after he 
completed of an alcohol safety and awareness program. The evidence related to this arrest is unclear about when he was initially arrested for this offense. 
However, Applicant asserts it was the evening of this arrest when he was arrested and charged with obstructing and hindering a police officer. (SOR &para; 1.g). 
Applicant testified that his parents came to get him from jail the evening of April 12, 1997 after he was arrested for DUI. Without explaining why police pulled 
them over, Applicant claimed he and his parents were the innocent victims of excessive force by the police. Further, he claims he and his parents won 
$30,000.00 through a civil suit against the police, but he has offered no other information to support his claim.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On June 23, 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and reckless endangerment after assaulting his wife and threatening his adult daughter with 
a handgun at their home. Also in the home was Applicant's seven-year-old granddaughter. Applicant's daughter, then about 23-years-old, was taking a nap and 
was awakened by a disturbance between Applicant and his wife. She left the house to call police. When the police arrived, Applicant refused to leave until he 
had finished eating dinner. The charges were </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle prosequi</EM> in April 1998 when Applicant's wife decided not to testify against her husband. (SOR &para; 1.h). 
Applicant's wife testified in his behalf, and asserted she does not remember that Applicant pushed her or that there was any altercation that led to her husband's 
arrest. Her testimony can best be described as inconclusive, and, having observed this witness's demeanor, particularly her body language,<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> I conclude that she 
was not a willing witness for Applicant. She stopped short of providing outright false statements, choosing instead to respond that she did not remember certain 
aspects of this event. I have assigned only minimal weight to her testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On September 16, 1998, Applicant was charged with assault. After he was arrested for this charge on October 26, 1998, the case was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle prosequi</EM>. (SOR &para; 
1.i).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On October 19, 1999, Applicant was involved in an auto accident wherein his car was rear-ended by another while Applicant was stopped at a traffic light. 
Applicant got out of his car and threatened the other driver. He also pushed the other driver. Applicant was arrested five days later and charged with assault. 
The charge was later </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle prosequi</EM>. (SOR &para; 1.j).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In November, 2000, Applicant and his now ex-wife were living apart due to Applicant's attendance at a physical rehabilitation center in another city. Applicant 
suspected his wife of having an extra-marital affair. He began to call his ex-wife and her friend at odd hours of the night to threaten them with bodily harm. He 
also went to his ex-wife's apartment before dawn and banged  on her door in a threatening manner. He was arrested and charged with telephone misuse and 
stalking, both misdemeanors. The charges were placed on the stet docket. (SOR &para; 1.k). Applicant's ex-wife testified as to these events and attempted to refute 
the contents of the police report admitted as GE 6. For the same reasons I outlined regarding her testimony about SOR &para; 1.h, above, I am unable to accord this 
evidence more than minimal weight.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant first received a security clearance in 1984. When he applied for that clearance, he submitted a DD Form 48 (DD-48). He intentionally falsified that 
form when he omitted information about his 1982 arrest and conviction for marijuana possession. He also deliberately falsified the same form when he denied 
ever using illegal drugs; however, he used marijuana at least twice between 1973 and 1974. (SOR &para; 2.c and &para; 2.d).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant more recently executed a Standard Form 86 (SF-86) on July 23, 2001. Despite the uncontroverted fact of the aforementioned arrests, Applicant chose 
only to list his November 2000 arrest for stalking. He was obliged by SF-86 question 26 to list any arrests within the preceding seven years, but deliberately 
chose to omit them. (SOR &para; 2.b). From the same questionnaire, Applicant deliberately omitted his arrests for drug and alcohol offenses as required by the plain 
language of question 24 to list any such arrests regardless of when they occurred. (SOR &para; 2.a). Applicant testified alternately that he either rushed through the 
questions or that he thought he only had to list those charges of which he was convicted.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in 
ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
Government.<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </STRONG>Under this</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG> </STRONG>guideline, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, 
or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Of note in this case is 
the government's concerns about Applicant's honesty</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">. The government has  proven its case, as alleged in SOR paragraph 2, that Applicant deliberately omitted 
relevant information from his DD-48 and SF-86 by deliberately omitting relevant and material information about drug and alcohol arrests and other arrests. 
Applicant is an intelligent person with enough education and personal experience to understand the plain meaning of each question put to him in both 
questionnaires. Even were I to accept (which I do not) his explanation that he thought he only had to disclose those offenses for which he was convicted, he was 
still obligated to disclose (which he did not) his convictions for marijuana possession in 1984 and his conviction for DUI in 1999. However, the only reasonable 
conclusion to be drawn from these facts is that the Applicant deliberately falsified both questionnaires, was granted access to classified information based in 
part on the first questionnaire, and has continued to engage in the same mendacious behavior even at his hearing. Guideline E disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN> 
applies with full effect to undermine this Applicant's suitability for continued access.</P> 
 
<P>By contrast, there is no basis whatsoever in this record for application of any Guideline E mitigating condition. Applicant has shown a complete disdain for the 
government's interests and has chosen to perpetuate his earlier falsifications through his second SF-86 and in his testimony at hearing. Such conduct reflects a 
tendency toward dishonesty and only serves to reinforce the government's concerns engendered by his extensive history of aggressive, criminal conduct. I 
conclude Guideline E against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG> <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="02-11959.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> This 
Applicant has been arrested 12 times in the past 30 years. He has repeatedly demonstrated an inability to handle conflict in a peaceful, mature way as evidenced 
by multiple acts of assault or threatening behavior against his own family as well as against complete strangers. He has likewise exhibited such a disregard for 
authority as to result in physical violence against a police officer. Applicant claims to have learned from his past conduct and asserts he is not at risk to engage 
in criminal conduct in the future. However, he is now over 50-years-old yet has been arrested as recently as three years ago. Given his extensive arrest record, 
the dearth of evidence of rehabilitation despite two periods of anger management counseling, and his failure to accept responsibility for his actions even at this 
late stage, there is no basis for application of any of the Guideline J disqualifying conditions. I am further persuaded that his criminal conduct renders him 
unsuitable for clearance by his insistence that police and investigators have falsified the police reports and one of the written statements in the record.  He has 
failed to substantiate his claims, which have the effect of convincing me that he still does not accept responsibility for his actions. I conclude Guideline J 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence in this case, and I have applied the aforementioned disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each 
applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. Despite two letters of support from a co-worker and his half-sister, I conclude Applicant is completely devoid of the requisite character, integrity and sound judgment of one in whom the government might repose its trust. 
The record evidence as a whole in this case presents an unacceptable risk to the government's compelling interest in ensuring its classified information is 
properly safeguarded. I conclude that Applicant's access to classified information should not be continued. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
