<P>Applicant's alcohol-related conduct in 1991 raises security concerns that are mitigated by the absence of alcohol-related behavior since then. Though Appellant 
was charged with alcohol-related behavior in November 2000, those charges were dismissed at the police station because Applicant's blood tested below the 
legal limit on two occasions. While Applicant omitted information regarding the November 2000 charge(s) from his security clearance application (SCA) in 
August 2002, the omission was unintentional. Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, amended April 4, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answer is undated but is notarized. Applicant elected to have his case decided on a written record. The Government provided Applicant a copy of 
the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 2, 2004. Applicant received the FORM on April 6, 2004 with instructions to respond within 30 days. His 
response to the FORM was received on or about June 22, 2004 because the postage stamp shows June 21, 2004 as the date his response was mailed. The case 
was assigned to me on July 14, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The SOR alleges alcohol consumption and personal conduct. Applicant admitted all the factual allegations. Applicant is 40 years old and employed as a 
software engineer by a defense contractor. He seeks a secret clearance. </P> 
 
<P>On July 14, 1991 (Applicant's 27th birthday), Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol (DWI). He had been 
drinking four or five beers over a seven hour period. He took a wrong turn and was stopped by the police. He failed a breath test and was transported to the 
police station. This alcohol-related offense was his first and the presiding judge ordered him to complete alcohol classes/counseling in lieu of potentially 
receiving a criminal record. After his successful completion of two months of counseling, the DWI charge was dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>On November 19, 2000, Applicant (age 36) had been drinking two or three drinks over a three hour period. He was tired and swerved his car while driving 
home because the road was under repair and not illuminated adequately. The police arrested and charged him with driving while under the influence of alcohol 
(DUI), and transported him to the police station. After passing two alcohol tests, the charges were dismissed. Though the SOR alleges that Applicant was 
charged with two DUI offenses on November 19, 2000, the language used in Applicant's sworn statement (Item 8) raises a reasonable inference he was charged 
with only one offense. Other than the state (Item 10) and federal records (Item 9), there is no evidence demonstrating Applicant was charged with two offenses.</P> 
 
<P>On October 23, 2002 (Item 8), Applicant furnished a sworn statement to the government describing his overall alcohol use in the last seven years and when he 
was stopped by the police. He mentioned he drank to the point of intoxication four times a year but always had a ride home so he would not drive. He never 
sought treatment nor has anyone ever suggested he seek counseling.<A HREF="03-00535.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Finally, he never had any embarrassing moments with friends nor embarrassing incidents 
involving his alcohol use. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant does not think he represents a problem under the alcohol guideline because the alcohol-related incidents do not represent a pattern and the most 
recent alcohol-related incident occurred over four years ago. Three reasons Applicant stopped most of his alcohol use are: (1) he tries to avoid drinking if he has 
to drive; (2) getting older and seeing no need to waste money on alcohol; and, (3) some of his medicines react adversely with alcohol. </P> 
 
<P>On August 24, 2002, about two months before the date of his sworn statement, Applicant signed an SCA. In response to question 24 of the SCA, Applicant 
answered "yes," indicating he had been charged or convicted of an offense related to alcohol and drugs, and he disclosed the 1991 offense. However, he did not 
disclose the 2000 DUI offense because he just copied the information from the 1994 SCA (Item 7) to the current SCA. Applicant also mistakenly believed the 
charges had been wiped out when they were dismissed at the police station. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Character Evidence</STRONG>. From 1989 to 1999, Applicant worked as a software engineer for one employer. He was hired by his current employer in 2000 because of 
a personal need for advancement in his field. Applicant has participated on the boards of several charitable organizations in the metropolitan area. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy conditions which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations. These 
conditions must be considered in every case according to the pertinent guideline; however, the conditions are in no way <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">automatically</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">determinative</SPAN> of the 
decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the conditions exhaust the entire realm of human experience or that the conditions apply equally in every 
case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of the 
facts in this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (DC):</P> 
 
<P>1.Alcohol-related incidents away from work;</P> 
 
<P>2. Habitual or binge drinking to the point of impaired judgment.</P> 
 
<P>Mitigating Conditions (MC):</P> 
 
<P>1. The alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern;</P> 
 
<P>2. The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem;</P> 
 
<P>3. Positive changes in a behavior supportive of sobriety.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (DC):</P> 
 
<P>2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire used to determine security 
clearance eligibility;</P> 
 
<P>Mitigating Conditions (MC):</P> 
 
<P>1. The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to the determination of judgment, trustworthiness or reliability;</P> 
 
<P>2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily;</P> 
 
<P>3. The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 16 of 
Enclosure 2 of the Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and, (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of a security clearance under 
this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, 
careful consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information 
in the future. The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case under the alcohol consumption and personal conduct guidelines that establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Then, the burden shifts to applicant to refute, explain, mitigate, or extenuate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to demonstrate he qualifies for a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to questionable judgment in both social and occupational functioning. It is important for security clearance holders to 
avoid alcohol abuse because of the increased risk of security violations related to excessive alcohol use. Since there is an alcohol-related incident in 1991 and 
one in 2000, DC 1 is relied on by the government to demonstrate a pattern of alcohol-related conduct away from work that disqualifies Applicant from security 
clearance access. In the 1991 DWI, Applicant had been drinking four or five beers. The alcohol impaired his behavior when he took a wrong turn and failed a 
breath test designed to determine if there was more than the legal limit of alcohol in his blood. While the 1991 DWI conviction suggests excessive consumption 
of alcohol, there is no evidence in the record to indicate the two-month counseling in 1991 was for alcohol abuse. On the contrary, most states have first 
offender sentence structures that essentially give the offender a second chance (to keep his record clean) by removing his first offense from his criminal record 
if he completes alcohol education classes/counseling in lieu of potentially exposing himself to punishment and a permanent criminal record. The 1991 
conviction was removed from Applicant's record in February 1992 following his successful completion of the required alcohol classes/counseling. </P> 
 
<P>More than nine years later in November 2000, Applicant's drinking was partially the cause of the alcohol-related charges, however, Applicant's vison was also 
hampered by a road with poor lighting and under repair. His release and dismissal of the DUI charge(s) after twice passing blood tests in November 2000 
distinguishes this case from the 1991 DWI conviction in that Applicant's alcohol level in November 2000 was insufficient to support a charge for DUI. 
Apparently, there were no other signs persuading the arresting officer to charge Applicant with a DUI or any other driving offense.<A HREF="03-00535.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Furthermore, there are no 
police reports or meaningful court records to establish either of the supposed DUI charges in November 2000. Finally, Applicant's sworn statement (Item 8) 
does not establish he was under the influence of alcohol. While he had been drinking, he was also tired and driving on a road under repair and under deficient 
lighting conditions. </P> 
 
<P>DC 5 refers to the habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impairment. Drinking two or three beers two or three times a month does not 
constitute habitual or binge consumption under the circumstances of this case. Getting intoxicated four times a year may however represent disqualifying 
evidence under DC 5. Assuming that the words/phrases "impairment," "intoxication" and "under the influence" are interpreted generally as reaching a mental 
status that increases an applicant's chances of committing poor judgment, the last documented time Applicant drank to impairment was in 1991 when he was 
apprehended for DWI. Having weighed all the evidence in the record, there is insufficient evidence to disqualify Applicant's security access based on DC 5. He 
has decreased alcohol consumption and is vigilant about other people driving when he has been drinking. </P> 
 
<P>MC 1 of the alcohol guideline is applicable here as there is no indication of pattern of abuse. The 1991 DWI occurred 13 years ago. Significantly, the 2000 
DWI, while alcohol-related, was dismissed because Applicant tested under the legal limit. MC 2 weighs in Applicant's favor because the last alcohol-related 
incident occurred in 2000 when the arresting officer determined there was insufficient evidence to support a an alcohol-related charge. MC 3 also works for 
Applicant as he is drinking less because he does not want to experience another DWI or some similar alcohol-related traffic offense. It is good Applicant 
realizes the adverse effect of alcohol on his medication. Considering the evidence as a whole, along with the general factors of the whole person concept, I find 
for Applicant under Guideline G and the whole person concept.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG>. Conduct that demonstrates dishonesty and poor judgment could mean that a person may not be able to properly safeguard classified 
information. While Applicant failed to disclose the 1990 incident in his response to question 24 of the SCA, the surrounding circumstances indicate the 
omission was unintentional. Applicant's reasons of carelessness caused by haste and believing that the charging process had ended when the DWI charge was 
dismissed in 2000 are two compelling explanations for concluding the omission was unintentional. Applicant clearly used poor judgment in not taking the 
appropriate time to provide the information correctly. However, by observing the charges get dismissed after passing two blood tests at the police station in 
November 2000, his omission of the information from question 24 was a reasonable position for him to take under the circumstances, even though the belief 
was mistaken. Accordingly, the personal conduct allegation is not supported by the record.  </P> 
 
<P>Assuming Applicant's carelessness explanation is considered incongruent with his reasonable belief the charges were dropped,<A HREF="03-00535.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> the pertinent behavioral 
changes Applicant has made under factor 6 (whole person concept) justify the conclusion that Applicant will successfully resist this kind of conduct in the 
future. If he should consume an impairing amount of alcohol (which is only about four times a year) he will make sure someone else in driving. He has reduced 
alcohol intake because he understands the deleterious effect on his medications. Having weighed and balanced the entire record, including the favorable 
evidence of Applicant's participation in charitable causes, I find for Applicant under the personal conduct guideline and the whole person concept of the 
Directive.</P>
