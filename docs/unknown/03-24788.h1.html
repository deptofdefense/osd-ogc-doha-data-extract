<P>Applicant, a Republic of China (Taiwan) born, former dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States, has fulfilled the requirements of the Memorandum from the 
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence, dated August 16, 2000, (Money Memorandum) by returning his 
Taiwanese passport to the Taiwanese Government. Additionally, he has renounced his Taiwanese citizenship.  Applicant's wife and children are U. S. citizens. 
None of Applicant's family members, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, are in a position to be exploited by Taiwan in a way that could force Applicant 
to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated December 
30, 2004, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, or denied. The SOR was based on Foreign Preference (Guideline C) related to his exercise of 
dual citizenship with the United States and Taiwan and Foreign Influence (Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close 
family members.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response, dated January 25, 2005, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative 
Judge. On March 23, 2005, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge  to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice dated May 10, 2005, a 
hearing was held on May 25, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 11 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 11) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered four documentary 
exhibits (Exhibits A - D) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on June 10, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline C (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Preference</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) and Guideline B (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of 
the Directive. The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a. through 1.e., under Guideline C, and six allegations, 2.a. through 2.f., under Guideline B. Applicant 
admitted SOR allegations 1.b. through 1.e., and 2.a. through 2.f.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration 
of that evidence, I make the additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 46 years old and is employed as a Systems Engineer by a United States defense contractor, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">which seeks a security clearance on his behalf.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1959. He moved to the  United States in 1983, and became a United States citizen in 1989. He received a Master of Science 
Degree in Mechanical Engineering from a United States university. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is married and has two children. His wife was also born in Taiwan, but she became a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Their children were born in the United 
States and are United States </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizens. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another 
country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1992, Applicant accepted employment in Taiwan because a downturn in the United States economy caused him to lose his employment there. While he was 
there he was employed by a Taiwanese company, which was not associated with the Taiwanese Government. After he stopped employment with that company, 
he started his own computer company, which also was not affiliated with the Taiwanese Government. He is now only employed by a United States company.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant resided in Taiwan until 1999, longer than he had planned, because his brother became ill with Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC), a deadly form of 
cancer, from which he died and which also afflicted his mother and five out of seven of her siblings.  In 1997, Applicant was diagnosed himself with NPC.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite the fact that Applicant became a United States citizen in 1989, he renewed his Taiwanese passport on July 22, 1997. Applicant never used this passport 
as a means to enter or exit any country after he became a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He renewed his Taiwanese </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">passport so that he could receive</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> medical services in 
Taiwan for the NPC.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1999, Applicant returned to the United States and has resided here since. He has no plan to reside in Taiwan again. On June 5, 2002, Applicant sent to the 
Taiwan Consulate Office a letter in which he surrendered his Taiwanese passport (Exhibits 5,  A). He also renounced his Taiwanese citizenship on September 
25, 2002 (Exhibit 6). Applicant testified that he has no intention to ever renew his Taiwanese citizenship or renew his passport (Tr at 46).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be 
bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother and two sisters are citizens of Taiwan, but have permanent resident status in the United States. His mother resides with him, and his two 
sisters both expect to reside in this country permanently. His mother-in-law also is a citizen of Taiwan, with permanent resident status in the United States (Tr 
at 41-42).  Finally, his sister-in-law is a resident and citizen of the United States.  None of these family members belong to, participate in, or are active with any 
national government agency of Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Taiwan several times from 1999 to 2003. His trips were for business and family, including the funeral of his father. He also traveled to 
Hong Kong for pleasure, and he made one trip to the People's Republic of China in 2001 to go sight seeing (Tr at 43-46).  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. 
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or 
emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination 
required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In 
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include 
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to Guidelines C and B:</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's decision to renew his 
Taiwanese passport after becoming a United Stated citizen, and his living, working and receiving medical services in Taiwan raises serious Foreign Preference 
(Guideline C) concerns. Initially Disqualifying Condition DC (E2.A3.1.2.1.), the exercise of dual citizenship, and DC (E2.A3.1.2.2.), possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport, could be argued to apply. However, Applicant has subsequently surrendered his Taiwanese passport. Neither the Money Memorandum nor DC 
( E2.A3.1.2.2.) now applies in this case. Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A3.1.3.4.), an individual has expressed a willingness to renounce his dual citizenship, 
is applicable, as Applicant has actually renounced his Taiwanese citizenship. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. The evidence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, who are citizens and 
residents of Taiwan comes within DC (E2.A2.1.2.1.), an immediate family members, or persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, 
are citizens of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.  Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including the lack of 
government involvement of Applicant's family members in Taiwan, and Applicant's long and powerful attachment, with his wife and children, to the United 
States, I have determined that his family members in Taiwan do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and MC (E2.A2.1.3.1.), a determination that the 
immediate family members, in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States, applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all of the evidence of record on this issue, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR, 
and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would reject it, and would  report the incident to 
the proper authorities. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's evidence opposing his request for a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">     <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline C:  FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
