<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thirty-four-year-old Applicant had six alleged debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR). </SPAN>Her largest SOR debt was settled and paid, and two other SOR debts were paid in full.  Two SOR debts 
were duplications, and she is making payments on her remaining SOR debt of approximately $2,000.  She currently has no legally enforceable, delinquent debts.  Her debt problems resulted from

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR), does not cite or refer to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, but it 
does cite DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the 
Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case, the pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the same. 
Paragraph C8.2.1 of the Regulation provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor personnel. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 22, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On August 29, 2006, DOHA issued a SOR 
to her, pursuant to the Directive.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be 
submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, received at DOHA on October 19, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> On October 31, 2006, the case was 
assigned to me.  The hearing was held on December 1, 2006.  At the hearing I approved Applicant's request that I hold the record open so she could submit additional documentary evidence (R. 36). 
DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (R.) on December 18, 2006.  Department Counsel had no objection to my consideration of the evidence Applicant provided, and I admitted her 
additional evidence (Ex. Q) on January 11, 2007.    </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the six debts listed on the SOR, but also indicated she was refinancing her home so that she could 
pay her creditors.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 34 years old.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Since April 2001, she has been employed by a United States government contractor, and she is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She has no prior 
military service.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has a high school diploma.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </SPAN>She attended a university from 1991 to 1993, and business college from 1995 to 1998.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><EM>Id</EM>. Applicant was married on December 4, 1993, and has 
one son (born in 1998).<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000, Applicant's parents were sick, and not living together, and she had to take care of them (R. 21, 23).  Helping her parents resolve their issues caused her to fall behind in her payments (R. 
21, 23, 28).  Her father died in March 2005, and her mother died in July 2005 (Ex. L at 3).  She was separated from her husband twice, for 9-12 months each time (R. 30).  The separations had a 
negative effect on her financial situation (R. 30).  In July 2004, they returned to living together in the same household, and have remained together thereafter (R. 31).  She and her husband each have 
a credit card, and both intend to pay off their credit card balances (R. 31).    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She has owned her own home for 30 months (R. 20).  On November 9, 2006, she refinanced her home and received $9,000 in cash (R. 20).  Her monthly mortgage payments increased from $400 to 
$871 per month (R. 28).  Her new mortgage balance is $77,200 (R. 29). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's personal financial statement (PFS) prepared in 2005<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> indicated her net monthly income was $1,150; and her husband's net monthly income was $1,800 per month.  Their total net 
household income is $2,950 per month.  She listed monthly household expenses as follows: mortgage  ($400), groceries ($500), household debts ($493), clothing ($0), utilities ($0), car expenses 
($0), and insurance ($0), and miscellaneous ($400).  She did not list any specific debt payments or other liabilities.  </SPAN></P>

Her performance appraisal, dated January, 6, 2006, is a good overall rating.  However,  it indicates she needs improvement in the area of dependability involving matters such as unscheduled 
absences, and it comments about her utilization of excessive unscheduled leave (Ex. Q at 7-10).         </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative </SPAN>judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its 
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the 
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.f became delinquent between 1999 and October 2001.  They have been delinquent for at least 
five years.  Applicant established that two SOR debts were paid on November 28, 2006, and the debt in SOR &para; 1.b was settled and paid on January 2, 2007.  Two debts were a duplication of a third 
debt (SOR debts &para;&para; 1.a, 1.e and 1.f), and they were placed into a payment plan in September 2006.         </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failure to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.f, which then became delinquent and remained 
delinquent for several years. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating 
condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> I conclude FC 
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple delinquent SOR debts.  Payment of two SOR debts in November 2006 and one in January 2007, after she received the SOR is simply too 
recent to merit application of FC MC 1. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to all of her SOR debts because the debts became delinquent in 2000 and 2001 and were the result of her periodic leaves from work, as well as her support to her mother 
and father when they were ill. This change in family circumstances is a good example of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3, causing financial problems that may be "largely 
beyond the person's control."  Applicant, however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she waited until November 2006 and January 2007, to pay three SOR debts. </P> 
 
<P>She received financial counseling, and receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there are clear indications (especially since November 2006) that the problem is resolved and under control.  In 
regard to application of the statute of limitations, FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts over 
the last four years.<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  She does, however, receive some credit in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>, for the application of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations to her debts.  <EM>See</EM> S.C. Code. 
Ann. &sect; 15-3-530 (listing the statute of limitations for various debts); <EM>Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch</EM>, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005), (explaining the 
societal value of application of the statute of limitations for delinquent debts).<A HREF="06-13590.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>"Whole Person" Analysis</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is currently 
34 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 
<SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her inability to repay her debts resulted from her absence from work to care for her mother and father.  There is 
some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the complete absence of new delinquent, unpaid debt over the last four 
years.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant is current on her recent debts.  She has no delinquent debt.  There is some concern about the difficulty she and 
her husband will have paying their increased mortgage. However, greater awareness of financial responsibilities will result in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances. Moreover, 
stability in her employment, increases in her income through annual salary increases, and reduction in her debt load should establish a solid financial foundation for her future.  In sum, the

that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a 
legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. </SPAN></P>
