<P>Applicant has a history of financial irresponsibility.  He owes approximately $15,000.00 on  eight delinquent debts.  Although Applicant claims three of the 
debts were discharged in a previous bankruptcy and two of the debts were paid, he has provided no documents to support his assertions.  While many of these 
debts arose from circumstances beyond his control, he has taken no action towards resolving his delinquent debts.  He did not deliberately falsify his security 
clearance application but failed to mitigate the security concern arising from his financial difficulties. Clearance is denied.   </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On June 22, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 12, 2005.  He admitted the allegations under Guideline F, subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.h and denies 
Guideline F subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f and 1.g and all the allegations under Guideline E.  He elected to have a hearing.  This case was assigned to me on 
November 22, 2005.  On January 3, 2006, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing scheduling the hearing on January 25, 2006.  The hearing occurred as scheduled.  
At the hearing, the Government offered eight exhibits which were admitted and marked as Government Exhibits 1 through 8.  Applicant testified and submitted 
no exhibits. The record was held open until February 8, 2006.  No additional exhibits were submitted. DOHA received the transcript on February 6, 2006. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance at the SECRET level.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1993, Applicant encountered financial difficulties which resulted in a bankruptcy.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  His financial problems were caused, in part by a medical problem which 
prevented him from holding steady employment over a five to six year period.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> From 1987 to sometime in the early 1990s, he had three surgeries on his back 
which caused him to be out of work.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He was unemployed between October 1997 to November 1999.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>     <STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 23, 2003, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In response to question "37. Your Financial Record - Unpaid Judgments.  In the last 7 
years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?" he answered, "No."  He also answered, "No," to question "38. Your Financial 
Delinquencies - 180 Days. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 day(s) delinquent on any debt(s)?" and question "39.  Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 
Days.  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A credit report, dated September 30, 2003, revealed three unpaid judgments, two charged off accounts and two collection accounts.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The judgments included 
an April 2002 judgment in the amount of $2,129.00 which is alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f;  two August 1998 judgments both in the amount of $759.00 
which are alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c.  The two charged off accounts include SOR subparagraph 1.a,  charged off in May 1997, with an 
approximate balance $498.00 and  SOR subparagraph 1.d, charged off in December 1998, with an approximate balance $4,347.00.  The two collection accounts 
include SOR subparagraph 1.e, with an approximate balance $6,490.00, turned over for collection in January 2001, and SOR subparagraph 1.g, with an 
approximate balance $108.00, turned over for collection in September 2001.  A March 21, 2005, credit report listed another collection account which is alleged 
in SOR subparagraph 1.h, with an approximate balance $243.00, turned over for collection in January 2003.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 11, 2004, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to a Special Agent of the Defense Security.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He was not aware of the accounts alleged in 
SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.e and 1.f. He believed the accounts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d were included in his bankruptcy.  He states he paid the 
account alleged in subparagraph 1.g, but provided no supporting documentation reflecting payment.  He indicated he would contact his creditors to satisfy his 
debts.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 2004, Applicant answered a set of interrogatories pertaining to his delinquent debt.  Since his March 11, 2004 statement, he discovered the debt 
alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.d was for a car loan he co-signed for his ex-wife.  He is trying to remove this from his credit report.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He stated the debt alleged 
in SOR subparagraph 1.e was paid off but provided no documentation indicating payment.  He explained he did not list the delinquent debts on his credit report 
because he was either not aware of the debts or thought they were discharged in his bankruptcy.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As of the hearing, Applicant took no action towards disputing the accounts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a,<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and 1.f.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  He was given the opportunity to 
submit a copy of his bankruptcy paperwork as well as receipts or other similar documentation verifying the debts that he claimed were paid.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  No 
documentation was submitted after the hearing. Applicant made no attempts to contact any of the creditors alleged in the SOR.  He did not seek out any sort of 
credit counseling.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline F, pertaining to financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct, with their respective DCs and MCs, apply in this case. Additionally, 
each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the 
probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting such classified information.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> The decision to 
deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-06494.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of all the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations  could indicate that a person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under 
Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F- Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline F, the government has established its case.  Applicant encountered  financial difficulties approximately 12 years ago which resulted in 
a bankruptcy filing. Subsequent to the bankruptcy discharge, he continues to incur delinquent debts.  He has debts totaling over $15, 000.00 which have 
remained unpaid for several years. His actions indicate that he is either unable or unwilling to pay his accounts.  His overall attitude and actions towards his 
finances give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (A<EM> history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>)<EM>.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several conditions could mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial delinquencies.  Neither Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 
(FC  MC) E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>)<EM>; </EM>or FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>It was an isolated incident</EM>)<EM> </EM>applies.  Applicant has had a history of financial 
difficulties since the early 1990s.  He continues to struggle with his finances and has several outstanding debts.  His inability or unwillingness to pay his 
delinquent debts is recent.  As such neither of these mitigating conditions apply.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Appellant underwent several back surgeries which caused him to have a period of sporadic employment spanning five years. As such FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 
(<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>),<EM> </EM>applies to his situation.  Much of the debt was created due to his inability to pay his debts while he was 
unemployed.  However, he has been steadily employed since 1999.  His inaction towards resolving his delinquent debt once gainfully employed gives less 
weight to this mitigating condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control</EM>)<EM> </EM>does not apply since<EM> </EM>he never sought financial counseling. Since he has not taken any action towards resolving his financial problems, either by 
payment or by formally disputing the debts, it is unlikely his financial problems will be resolved in the near future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant claims he has paid  the debts alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.g, he has not provided any documentation verifying payment.  He 
claims most of the other debts alleged were included in his previous bankruptcy which he claims was completed in 1993 or 1994.  He had the opportunity to 
provide his bankruptcy paperwork and receipts after the hearing, but did not submit anything.  He has made no attempts to research the debts (SOR 
subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d) that he claims to have no knowledge. For these reasons, I cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 <EM>(The individual initiated a good-faith effort 
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) </EM>since he has not demonstrated that he has made a good-faith effort to resolve these debts.  He was first 
put on notice regarding these debts in March 2004.  He took no steps to resolve his delinquent debt even though he had over a year and eight months to work on 
resolving his financial situation prior to the hearing. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F.  Guideline F is decided against 
Applicant.    <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case, the record evidence fails to establish Applicant deliberately omitted or concealed information about his unpaid judgments and delinquent debts.  
Although his answers to question 37, 38  and 39 were incorrect, Applicant successfully rebutted the allegations that he deliberately provided a false answer.  I 
find credible his explanation that he either forgot about these debts or was under the mistaken belief that the debts were discharged in bankruptcy.  Applicant 
did list a wage garnishment in response to question 34 on his security clearance application.  The fact that he listed this wage garnishment undercuts the implicit 
assumption that he was trying to hide his derogatory financial history.  Guideline E is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, common 
sense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a 
careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, 
omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying 
sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests. I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the financial considerations. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of 
the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
