<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, a<STRONG> </STRONG>46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, has four convictions for alcohol-related driving offenses over a 17-year period, and has not mitigated 
the security concerns regarding Guideline G, alcohol consumption. His most recent conviction was in 2003. Although he believes alcohol has created some

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM>, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant because of security concerns arising under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated January 12, 2006, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR. He elected to have his case decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on February 2, 2006. Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM)<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions. Applicant received the FORM on February 16, 2006. Applicant  did not submit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 
2006.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption under Guideline G (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e) of the SOR.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Those admissions 
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a single,<STRONG> </STRONG>46-year-old senior project manager for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant has worked for this contractor since 1997. On November 26, 2003, 
he submitted his security clearance application.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began socially drinking in college at parties. In his late twenties he drank beer on a limited basis at parties.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Since 1987, he consumed alcohol, at 
times to excess, to the point of intoxication. Applicant's alcohol consumption continued until at least July 2003. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 15, 1987, the police arrested and charged Applicant with Driving Under the Influence (DUI). Applicant was found guilty. The court placed him on 
supervised probation for eight months with the county Alcohol Safety Action Program. The court assessed a fine of $100.00, and his license was suspended for 
60 days.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 3, 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with a DUI, First Offense. The court found him guilty, and placed him on six months probation. He paid a 
$300.00 fine, and his license was suspended for 60 days, and he was ordered to attend Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 13, 1999, the police arrested and charged Applicant with a DUI. He was found guilty, and sentenced to 10 days in jail (suspended), if he successfully 
completed 18 months of probation. His license was suspended for 180 days with the placement of an ignition interlock device on his vehicle.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 4, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with a DUI. The court found him guilty, ordered him to pay a fine of at least $250.00, and was placed 
under house arrest. He was placed on probation until September 2004. He could drive only with an ignition interlock system on his vehicle.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not been diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. He was evaluated by licensed counselors and has not attended any inpatient 
alcohol rehabilitation. He has not had any accidents associated with the DUI's. Applicant claims he has been abstinent since the last alcohol related driving 
charge and he plans to remain so in the future.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant manages east coast projects for his company with contracts valued in excess of $3.5 million. Applicant has access to many government and military 
facilities as part of his job. His company works in secure areas but never handles secure material. He is disappointed in himself because he may have put his job 
in jeopardy. Applicant does not drink at work and has never had any reprimands for such. He notes his drinking has not caused any difficulties at work or ability 
to perform his job. However, he does admit the drinking incidents reflect impaired judgment in operating a motor vehicle.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> His drinking pattern between 1987 
and 2003 indicates consumption of alcohol to the point of periodic impaired judgment. Binge drinking is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings blood-alcohol 
concentration to .08 gram percent or above. For the typical adult, this pattern corresponds to consuming 5 or more drinks (male), or 4 or more drinks (female), 
in about 2 hours.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Applicant's drinking meets the criteria for "binge drinking" according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's 
eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's 
eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2, Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Because the entire process is a 
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Process factors to consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Protecting national security is the paramount 
concern in reaching a decision in any case, and is dependent upon the primary standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly consistent with the interest 
of national security. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G -Alcohol Consumption: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness</STRONG>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Guideline G disqualifying and mitigating conditions applicable to this case are set forth and discussed in the Conclusion section below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or mitigation 
sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue the applicant's clearance.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Any 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of national security.<A HREF="05-12288.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One additional comment is worthy of note. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of the Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned." Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. 
Nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to each 
allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>The government has established its case under Guideline G. Based on all the evidence,  Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. 
(<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol 
use) </EM>and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5. (<EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment) </EM>apply in this case. Over a period of seventeen 
years, the police arrested and charged Applicant with four DUI offenses. These incidents qualify as alcohol-related incidents away from work. During this same 
period, his drinking was excessive on a regular basis, causing impaired judgment, court convictions for DUI, and jail time. Applicant admitted to excessive 
consumption of alcohol to the point of intoxication from 1987 to 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to the above incidents, Applicant's consumption of alcohol reflects a pattern of binge drinking, according to NIAA criteria, since his twenties. He 
repeatedly drove while intoxicated. Although he had a gap between alcohol-related arrests, his recurrent arrests reveal a pattern of alcohol abuse through at least 
2003 (his last alcohol conviction). Applicant implies his drinking problem is under control because he reports abstinence since his last charge. However, the 
record contains no evidence to support this claim. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) and conclude that  none apply in this case. Applicant continued to drink and drive 
and has not participated meaningfully in any alcohol rehabilitation program. He has continued to deny that he has a problem with alcohol use. His alcohol 
consumption still meets the criteria for "binge drinking." There is no evidence in the record to support behavior changes or the elimination of high risk behavior 
of drinking and driving. He intends to abstain in the future but his past conduct demonstrated a pattern of periodic drunk-driving arrests. Only 2.5 years have 
passed since the 2003 arrest, and based on Applicant's pattern, insufficient time has passed to be able to conclude confidently that he will not engage in such 
behavior in the future. Despite the fact that he completed prior probations successfully, he is not currently receiving any professional counseling. Applicant 
failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his alcohol consumption. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the record evidence in this case with respect to the "whole person" concept required by the Directive in evaluating Applicant's vulnerability in 
protecting our national security. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant a security clearance. For the reasons, stated, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by Applicant's alcohol consumption. 
Accordingly, Guideline G is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
