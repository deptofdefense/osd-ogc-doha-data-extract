<P>Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola issued a decision, dated December 8, 2000, in which he concluded it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  The Board 
remands the case to the Administrative Judge for further processing consistent with the rulings and instructions set forth in this 
Decision and  Remand Order.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 
1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to consider Applicant's 
response to the File of Relevant Material; and (2) whether the Board should remand the case with instructions to grant Applicant a 
hearing.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 28, 2000.  The SOR 
was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  
Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR.  In the answer, Applicant did not ask for a hearing and indicated "I believe an 
administrative determination will be fine."  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared.  A copy of the FORM was 
provided to Applicant, who submitted a response to the FORM, dated November 20, 2000.  By memorandum dated November 27, 
2000, Department Counsel indicated it did not object to Applicant's response to the FORM.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated December 8, 2000, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on Applicant's 
appeal from the Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has offered new evidence in support of her appeal.  The Directive specifically prohibits the Board from considering new 
evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Accordingly, the new evidence presented by 
Applicant cannot be considered in deciding this appeal.</P> 
 
<P>1.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by failing to consider Applicant's response to the File of Relevant Material</SPAN>.  The 
Administrative Judge's decision contains the following statement: "Applicant received her copy [of the FORM] on October 23, 
2000, and submitted nothing in reply."  Applicant points to that statement and contends her response to the FORM was not 
reviewed by the Judge.  Department Counsel concedes Applicant submitted a timely response to the FORM and indicates that it 
does not oppose a remand of the case to the Administrative Judge for clarification or reconsideration as appropriate.</P> 
 
<P>A review of the case file shows Applicant's response to the FORM was received and later forwarded to the Administrative Judge 
under cover of a memorandum dated November 27, 2000.  Furthermore, the November 27, 2000 memorandum states "The 
Applicant submitted information  within the specified time period of 30 days after receiving a copy of the File of Relevant 
aterial." Accordingly, there is no rational basis for the Judge to conclude Applicant "submitted nothing in reply" to the FORM.</P> 
 
<P>In its reply brief, Department Counsel suggests it is possible that the Administrative Judge's quoted statement "was the result of a 
typographical error."  A mere typographical error in a Judge's decision does not warrant remand or reversal.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 99-0500 (May 19, 2000) at 3.  However, in this case, a review of the Judge's decision in its entirety leaves us unable to 
conclude that the quoted statement is merely a typographical error.  Nothing in the Judge's decision indicates or otherwise provides 
a rational basis for the Board to conclude the Judge considered Applicant's response to the FORM.</P> 
 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considers all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically 
states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 3.  In this case, the Judge's decision makes clear he 
did not consider Applicant's response to the FORM.  An applicant's right to present evidence in response to a FORM is an 
important one.  It was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law for the Judge to fail to consider Applicant's response to the FORM.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should remand the case with instructions to grant Applicant a hearing</SPAN>.  Applicant asks the Board to remand 
the case with instructions to allow her to have "a hearing <EM>de novo</EM> to review all the evidence submitted to date and other relevant 
evidence that should have been included in the applicant's and the government's case files.  In addition, we request a hearing vice 
administrative determination to reduce the risk of further procedural errors."  Department Counsel opposes this aspect of 
Applicant's appeal, arguing that: (a) Applicant elected to have her case decision on a written record without a hearing; (b) 
Applicant's request for a hearing at this time is too late; and (c) granting a hearing now would prejudice the government because it 
would allow Applicant to offer evidence beyond that presented in her response to the FORM.  For the reasons that follow, the 
Board concludes Applicant's request to be allowed the opportunity to submit new evidence on remand is a form of relief to which 
she is not entitled.</P> 
 
<P>The June 28, 2000 letter that was sent to Applicant with the SOR issued to her specifically informed Applicant that she had to 
"<STRONG>State whether or not you wish to have a hearing or a decision without a hearing</STRONG>" (bold in original).  The June 28, 2000 letter 
also had a paragraph explaining what would happen if Applicant asked for a hearing, and another paragraph explaining what 
would happen if Applicant asked for an administrative determination.  When Applicant submitted her answer to the SOR, she did 
not ask for a hearing, but rather indicated "I believe an administrative determination will be fine."  Applicant's <EM>pro se</EM> status did not 
relieve her of the obligation to take timely, reasonable steps to protect her rights under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0086 (December 13, 2000) at p. 2.  Applicant was notified of her right to ask for a hearing and was 
given the opportunity to exercise that right.  Applicant elected to have her case decided without a hearing.  Considering the record 
as a whole, the Board concludes Applicant waived her right to a hearing.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 95-0818 (January 31, 1997) at 
pp. 2-3.</P> 
 
<P>Absent a showing of harmful error that affects a party's right to present evidence in the proceedings below, a party does not have 
any right to have a second chance at presenting its case before an Administrative Judge.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0086 
(December 13, 2000) at pp. 2-3; ISCR Case No. 98-0252 (September 15, 1999) at p. 9.  To the extent a party fails to present 
evidence for consideration by the Judge, the party waives the opportunity to have such evidence considered.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case 
No. 98-0617 (July 14, 1999) at p. 2; ISCR Case No. 98-0257 (January 22, 1999) at p. 2 n1.<A HREF="00-0250.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The right to present evidence for 
consideration by a Judge does not mean that a party has multiple chances to present evidence regardless of the provisions of the 
Directive governing the orderly handling of these cases.  And, a party is not entitled to have the case reopened to allow the 
introduction of evidence that comes into existence after the close of the record.  Neither the passage of time nor purported changes 
in Applicant's situation since the close of the record below give her a right to have a hearing now.  As the Supreme Court as noted:</P> 
 
<P>"' Administrative consideration of evidence . . . always creates a gap between the time the record is closed and the time the 
administrative decision is promulgated [and, we might add, the time the decision is judicially reviewed] . . . .  If upon the coming 
down of the order the litigants might demand rehearings as a matter of law because some new circumstance has arisen, some new 
trend has been observed, or some new fact discovered, there would be little hope that the administrative process could ever be 
consummated in an order that would not be subject to reopening.'"  <EM>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources 
Defense Council, Inc.</EM>, 435 U.S. 519, 554-555 (1978)(quoting <EM>ICC  v. Jersey City</EM>, 322 U.S. 503, 514 (1944)).</P> 
 
<P>Because there must be some reasonable degree of administrative finality in DOHA adjudications, the Board has followed that 
reasoning.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 86-1802 (September 23, 1988) at p. 4.</P> 
 
<P>Applicants are entitled to receive their full measure of due process under Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Applicants are 
not entitled to get relief that ignores or circumvents the pertinent provisions of Executive Order 10865 or the Directive.  
Applicants are not entitled to be relieved of the consequences of decisions and choices they make on how to proceed with their 
case if they are not satisfied with the results.  Furthermore, applicants are entitled have the provisions of Executive Order 10865 
and the Directive applied in a fair, impartial and even-handed  manner.  Ignoring the pertinent provisions of Executive Order 
10865 or the Directive to give an applicant "a break" would have the practical effect of depriving other, similarly situated 
applicants of the fair, impartial and even-handed application of the law to which they are entitled.  If the Board were to grant 
Applicant's request for a new hearing or allow her to submit new evidence in this case, then the Board would be giving her special 
treatment and denying other, similarly-situated applicants of their right to receive the fair, impartial, and even-handed application 
of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's error in this case deprived Applicant of her right to have her response to the FORM considered.  The 
Judge's error did not affect Applicant's right to ask for a hearing.  The Judge's error did not relieve Applicant of the consequences 
of her decision to ask for an administrative determination instead of a hearing.  Nor did it relieve Applicant of the consequences of 
her decisions about what materials to submit in response to the FORM.  Applicant is entitled only to that relief which remedies the 
Judge's error and provides her with the full measure of due process to which she is entitled under Executive Order 10865 and the 
Directive.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Pursuant to Item E3.1.33.2 of the Directive's Additional Procedural Guidance, the Board remands the case to the Administrative 
Judge with instructions to issue a new decision (pursuant to Item E3.1.25 of the Additional Procedural Guidance) after the Judge 
considers the case file (including Applicant's response to the FORM) that was compiled before the Judge was assigned the case.  
The new evidence submitted by Applicant on appeal is not part of the record to be considered by the Judge on remand.  Applicant 
is not entitled to have a hearing.  Because Applicant is not entitled to submit additional evidence and because Applicant's response 
to the FORM is contained in the case file that was before the Judge in the proceedings below, the Judge should not reopen the 
record to receive any further submissions from the parties.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 86-1802 (September 23, 1988) at p. 3 (Board has 
authority to limit scope of proceedings on remand).</P>
