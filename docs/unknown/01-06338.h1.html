<P>Although Applicant had surrendered one of his expired Lebanese passports and had applied for renunciation of his Lebanese citizenship, Applicant did not 
overcome the adverse implications of his demonstrated foreign preference by obtaining a Lebanese passport in 1990, renewing it in 1996, and using it to travel 
to Lebanon in 1991, 1996, and 1998--all in preference to his U.S. citizenship and passport (obtained in April 1991, before his first trip to Lebanon). Similarly, 
Applicant did not rebut his susceptibility to foreign influence based on his mother's living in Lebanon and his own real estate interests in Lebanon. Clearance 
denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 17 September 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)(Item 1) to Applicant, stating that DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
On 25 September 2001, Applicant answered the SOR (Item 3) and requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant responded to the 
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 26 November 2001; the record in this case closed 10 December 2001, the day the response was 
received at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 12 December 2001, and received by me the next day, to determine whether clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the allegations of paragraph 1. of the SOR, except for the allegation of subparagraph 1.d. (using his Lebanese passport to travel to Lebanon). 
Applicant admitted the allegations of paragraph 2. of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 37-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Lebanon in October 1964, the son of a U.S.-born father and a Syrian-born mother.<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Consequently, he is a Lebanese citizen by birth and, 
according to his Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86) executed on 18 May 1999 (Item 4), a U.S. citizen by virtue of having been "born abroad of U.S. 
citizen(s)".<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant's U.S. citizenship was formally recognized by State Department certificate issued in July 1992. However, Applicant has a U.S. passport 
issued in April 1991.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 11 May 2000, Applicant described his dual citizenship in a sworn statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS)(Item 5):</SPAN></P> 
<P>My current passport for Lebanon was issued in Apr 96 and will expire in Apr 01. My previous passport was issued in Nov 90 and expired in Apr 96. These 
were obtained after I  became a citizen of the US. It was obtained so that travel in Lebanon would be easier and safer. I use the passport in Jul 91, Dec 96, and 
Oct 98 when I traveled to Beirut, Lebanon to visit family.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I have no obligations or responsibilities with this passport to Lebanon because I used it. It was only used for safe and easier travel in Lebanon. Now that my 
relatives visit me yearly I have no intentions of travelling there.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I am willing to renounce my citizen and relinquish my passport as a condition of access if required. My loyalty is to the US.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I have never served in any foreign country's military nor performed any type of service in lieu of military service and I do not have any obligation to do so.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I have no desire to accept any rights, privileges or benefits offered by Lebanon to its citizens in preference to those of the US.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I have not and do not intend to travel to Lebanon to fulfill and (any?) type of citizenship requirements.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I do not maintain dual citizenship to protect financial interests. However my mother moved to a new condo and left their old condo in my name and my 
brother's name.<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> I would relinquish my share to my brother if this were a matter of access for my current position.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I am not registered for military service in Lebanon nor do I vote in any foreign elections. I have never sought, held, or desire to seek any political office in 
Lebanon.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I have never nor will I ever use my US Government position of trust or responsibility to influence decisions in order to serve the interests of another 
government in preference to those of the US.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>I am a US citizen. My total obligation and loyalty is to the US. I am a citizen of Lebanon by birth and would renounce it as indicated above if it was a condition 
for access.</P> 
<P>         <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR asserted that he had renounced his Lebanese citizenship and surrendered his passport. As corroboration of this claim, Applicant 
tendered a 24 September 2001 letter, under apparent seal, from the Consular Section of the Embassy of Lebanon:</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Embassy of Lebanon certifies that [Applicant]<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> born in [city]<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 1964 and holder of Lebanese passport No. [] issued in Washington on November 19th, 
1990, has applied for renunciation of his Lebanese nationality. His complete application was examined processed and sent to Beirut. He has therefore 
surrendered his passport to the embassy pending the completion of this procedure.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Therefore this document attesting that [Applicant] has applied for renunciation of his Lebanese Nationality, and has surrendered his passport to the embassy 
was issued by the Embassy of Lebanon on September 24th , 2001.</P> 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taken at face value, the letter establishes that Applicant has applied to renounce his Lebanese citizenship. However, neither the letter nor any of Applicant's 
other submissions contain any information regarding the time line for completion of the renunciation procedure or whether completion is a routine process or 
subject to special scrutiny. Further, the letter specifically cites Applicant's November 1990 Lebanese passport, which expired in April 1996, but makes no 
reference to the disposition of Applicant's April 1996 Lebanese passport, which expired in April 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR admitted that he had used his Lebanese passport to visit family in Lebanon and had done so for reasons of personal safety. He 
does not anticipate traveling to Lebanon in the future because of the political situation in the Middle East. Applicant's 60-year old mother is separated from his 
father, and has lived in Lebanon at least since the time of Applicant's application for security clearance. She visits Applicant in the U.S. every two years.<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has reported several different versions of his real estate interests in Lebanon. His sworn statement to the DSS (Item 5) suggested that a condominium 
in Lebanon had been titled in the names of Applicant and his brother. His Answer to the SOR suggested that the property had no substantial value--due to the 
state of the Lebanese economy, and the property's location in an area of civil unrest--and that Applicant and his brother only stood to inherit the property upon 
their father's death. Applicant's Response to the FORM now states flatly that he has no financial interest in the condominium and that only his brother will 
inherit upon his father's death. The record is void of any independent evidence to corroborate any of these three versions. In a similar fashion, the record is 
silent on Applicant's work record or involvement in the community.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A3.1.1 The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A3.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum titled 
"Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline" (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum), 
to clarify the guideline regarding possession and/or use of a foreign passport:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Security Research Center (SRC) has recently completed a study of the efficiency and effectiveness of the implementation by the Department of 
Defense of the Adjudicative Guidelines and Investigative Standards approved by the President in 1997. The results indicate that DoD has successfully 
implemented the Adjudicative Guidelines and Investigative Standards. While the implementation of the guidelines as a whole was considered adequate, the 
implementation of one guideline in particular was the focus of SRC's recommendation for further attention: Guideline C, Foreign Preference. SRC found that 
DoD's implementation of this guideline was problematic in cases involving the possession and/or exercise of dual citizenship, including especially cases 
involving the use of dual passports.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign passport. The 
Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition. It contains no mitigating factor related to 
the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country. The only applicable mitigating factor addresses 
the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use. The security concerns underlying this guideline are that the possession and use 
of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raise doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also 
facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States. <STRONG>Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or 
revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States 
Government. </STRONG>Modification of the Guideline is not required. (Emphasis added).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">        </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ths clarification of the current adjudication policy applies to all cases in which a final decision has not been issued as of the date of this memorandum.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant has been a dual citizen of Lebanon and the United States since his birth in 1964, Applicant's foreign citizenship possesses little security 
significance if based solely on his birth in a foreign country. For Applicant's conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, Foreign Preference, he 
must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of 
the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
those entrusted with this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen. Under this 
assessment, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant claims to prefer his U.S. citizenship to his Lebanese citizenship, his conduct belies that assertion. Applicant reasserted his Lebanese 
citizenship and his preference for that citizenship when he applied for a Lebanese passport in November 1990, used it to travel to Lebanon in July 1991, 
renewed his Lebanese passport in April 1996, and used it to travel to Lebanon in December 1996 and October 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A citizen of any country, including the U.S., who travels to another country, submits to the sovereignty of that country, including application of its laws 
regarding visits by foreign citizens. However, a citizen of the U.S. who travels abroad only as a U.S. citizen, travels with the knowledge the U.S. Government is 
available to provide diplomatic assistance if the traveler encounters difficulty. A dual citizen of the U.S. and a foreign state who travels to that foreign state 
faces potential difficulty in obtaining U.S. diplomatic assistance, because the foreign state may insist on treating the traveler as its own citizen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding possession and use of his foreign passport, Applicant meets only one of the mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference. His dual citizenship is 
not based merely on his birth in a foreign country, but on his active assertion of his citizenship rights in that country. Applicant's voluntary assertion of his 
foreign citizenship rights occurred after he was a U.S. citizen. Although his conduct is lawful, there is no evidence that the conduct was formally sanctioned by 
the United States. Applicant now meets the mitigating condition (MC) for foreign preference pertaining to an expressed willingness to renounce his foreign 
citizenship, and has gone so far as to apply for renunciation. Further, Applicant meets the requirements of the  ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum--at least regarding his 
1990 Lebanese passport. However, I am concerned that Applicant appears to have surrendered only the older of his two expired Lebanese passports and the fact 
that the record is silent on the likelihood of successful renunciation of his Lebanese citizenship. I am also concerned because Applicant's actions to surrender 
his passport and renounce his Lebanese citizenship seem to have been precipitated by the issuance of the SOR.<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In the final analysis, the Government having 
established the disqualifying aspects of Applicant's conduct, the Applicant has a heavy burden of demonstrating that it is nevertheless still clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. I conclude Applicant has failed to meet that burden. Accordingly, I resolve 
Guideline C against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has also established it case under Guideline B. Applicant's mother lives in Lebanon. Despite Applicant's assertion that he does not maintain 
close contact with his mother, their relationship is sufficiently close that she visits Applicant in the U.S. every two years.<A HREF="01-06338.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> While I consider it unlikely that 
Applicant's 60-year old mother is an agent of a foreign power, it does not conclusively appear that she is not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in 
a way that requires Applicant to choose between his competing loyalties. In a similar fashion, Applicant appears  to have a substantial property interest in 
Lebanon, based on his initial statement to the DSS. He now retreats from that statement, but provides no corroboration of his claims which would permit me to 
conclude that his holdings are insignificant. Just as with Guideline C., Applicant has a heavy burden to demonstrate that the mitigating conditions apply to his 
case. I conclude that Applicant has failed to meet that burden and I have some lingering doubts about Applicant's susceptibility to foreign influence. 
Accordingly, I resolve those doubts against Applicant and resolve Guideline B. against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
