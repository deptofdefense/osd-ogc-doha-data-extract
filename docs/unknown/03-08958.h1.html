<P>Applicant is 49 years old and works as a training specialist/analyst for a defense contractor since 2003. He was married twice. His first marriage ended in 
divorce. His second marriage is to a citizen of the People's Republic of China, living here in the U.S. His parents-in-laws are citizens and residents of PRC. In 
his security clearance application, Applicant <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberately omitted information. He offered rebuttal to the omissions, but it was not credible</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He has not mitigated 
the foreign influence or personal conduct security concerns. Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>HISTORY OF CASE</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 2, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In a sworn statement dated December 20, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. In his Answer, Applicant elected to have his case decided on the 
written record. Department Counsel submitted the government's file of relevant material (FORM) on April 1, 2005. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on 
April 5, 2005, and received on April 12, 2005. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. He did not submit a response to the FORM.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the FORM, the government moved to amend the SOR by adding a new allegation under Guideline E and the new allegation is identified as &para; 2.b. In the 
absence of an objection from Applicant, the government's motion to amend the SOR is granted. The case was assigned to me on May 18, 2005.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted the allegations in &para; 1 of the SOR and denied the allegations in &para; 2. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 49 years old and works as a training specialist/analyst for a defense contractor since 2003.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He served in the U.S. Army (E-4) from 1982 to 1986.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
His status in the Army is now, "inactive reserve duty." In 1993, he graduated from a U.S. university with a Doctorate in Education (Ed.D). He received a M.Ed. 
degree from the same U.S. university in January 1990.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He has been married twice. While stationed in Germany, he met and married his first wife in 1984. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2001.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> There is one child 
of the marriage.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married his current wife in 2002, here in the U.S. His wife is a citizen of the People's Republic of China (PRC).<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His parents-in-law are residents and 
citizens of PRC.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 13, 1999, he submitted a SF 86<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and another one was submitted on January 24, 2003. In the SF 86, dated July 1999, Question 32 asked: "To your 
knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, or have you ever been debarred from government 
employment?" He responded "yes" and relayed an event occurring on August 1, 1985 as follows: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Until she met me [first wife], she had an intense hatred for Americans, and especially the US Armed Forces and US Government. I think it was due mainly to 
her dislike for alleged CIA actions in Chile involving Pinochet and for US involvement in the Vietnam war. As the marriage progressed while still living in 
Frankfurt, I found myself moving more and more towards her way of thinking. . . . Becasue [sp] of my potential vulnerability, I decided to tell my commander 
and ask them to suspend my security access and clearance. It was done so at my request. I did not want to find myself in a compromising position.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In a report, dated August 21, 1985, the company commander recommended that Appellant's security clearance be revoked because the allegations in the report 
alleged the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">[Appellant] was investigated by the U.S. Army Intelligence (USAI) after receiving information that the [Applicant] bragged about being in contact with the 
Chinese Embassy and that the [Applicant] submitted paperwork through the IG to be reclassified as a conscientious objector.  Further [Applicant] was 
diagnosed as having an Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood.  It has further been alleged that the [Applicant's] wife was a former member of the 
Communist Party.  Background history on [Applicant's] wife, which was filled out when they decided to get married, can no longer be found in the Company 
orderly room.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SF 86, dated January 24, 2003, Question 32 asked: "To your knowledge, have you ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or 
revoked, or have you ever been debarred from government employment?" He responded "no." Allegedly, his clearance was suspended, not because of a self-initiated report, but rather because military intelligence received information that he allegedly contacted the Chinese embassy.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> When the military attempted to </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">question him about this contact, Applicant, through his military defense counsel, asserted his right under Article 31 since Applicant was a military member 
subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In both SF 86s, Question 14 asked: "Have you had contact with a foreign government, its establishments (embassies or consulates), or its representatives, 
whether inside or outside the U.S., other than on official U.S. Government business?" He responded "yes" in each SF 86.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His answer in the earlier SF 86 
stated that on August 1, 1981 he "[v]isited the embassy [Chinese] there while in Malta to ask about Chinese language training possibilities. I never returned due 
to a job change." In the 2003 SF 86, he indicated that he visited the Chinese embassy in 1985 in order to seek a tutor in Chinese.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with foreign policy goals antithetical to the U.S. It has an active, effective intelligence service that targets U.S. 
intelligence and economic information and operates against its citizens in the U.S.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline B, pertaining to foreign influence and Guideline E, personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, apply in this case. Additionally, each security 
clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, 
along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, 
willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the 
circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not 
outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline B, Foreign Influence: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contact with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E, Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under 
Guideline B, foreign influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  Similarly, the government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline E, personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline B, Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>). Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 defines "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>immediate family members</EM>" 
to include (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters</EM>). Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> has immediate family members, his wife, a citizen of PRC and his 
mother- and father-in-law are residents and citizens of PRC. The record is devoid as to whether he maintains regular contact with his in-laws. But I will assume 
that even if he has minimal contact with his parents-in-law, his wife appears to have obvious bonds of affection to her parents. In fact, his wife traveled to PRC 
for approximately four to six weeks in the Winter of 2002 to visit family and friends.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> These circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information."<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> While the-</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies. Similarly, it may be disqualifying where an applicant (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>shar[es] living quarters with a person . . . if 
the potential for adverse foreign influence of duress exists</EM>).<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> Applicant's wife, who he lives with, was born in PRC and is a citizen of PRC. It is possible his 
wife a foreign power could improperly influence or exert pressure upon her, here or when she visits her parents who are citizens and residents of PRC. Under 
the circumstances, I find this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under the Directive, the security concerns arising from possible foreign influence may be mitigated under certain circumstances. There record contains virtually 
no information as to the: occupation of his wife and parents-in-law; what, if any relationship, any of them have with the PRC or whether or not they are agents 
of a foreign power; and whether the contact with his parents-in-law is casual and infrequent. Thus, I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply under 
Guideline B, &para; 1.a through 1.d.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline E. Paragraph E2.A5.1.2.2 of the Directive provides that it 
may be a disqualifying condition if (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire, personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities)</EM>.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> I am convinced 
Applicant fraudulently and deliberately omitted information in his SF 86 dated July 13, 1999. I conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On the security application, he responded "yes" to Question 32 and listed that he personally requested the suspension of his security access and clearance in 
1985.  In truth, his collateral security access and clearance was suspended as a result of a military investigation</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and his company commander recommended that 
his clearance be revoked based on the following: (1) Applicant bragged about being in contact with the Chinese Embassy and submitted paperwork to be 
reclassified as a conscientious objector; (2) Applicant was diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder with depressed mood; and (3) allegation that his ex-wife 
was a former member of the Community Party.<A HREF="03-08958.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that his behavior was more than carelessness and a deliberate attempt to mislead the government.  Moreover, PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>personal conduct 
or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, 
may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>), applies. I conclude that PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.2 and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 apply here.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed all the personal conduct mitigating conditions and conclude none apply.  Falsification of a security clearance application is a serious matter and 
it is not easily mitigated or explained away. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our 
national interests. I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the foreign influence concerns and personal conduct concerns. 
Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Accordingly, Guideline B and Guideline E are decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
