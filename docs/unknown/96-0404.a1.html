<P ALIGN="CENTER"><EM>Pro se</EM></P>

<P>Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason issued a decision, dated February 4, 1997, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Applicant appealed. For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as
amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 12, 1996 (later redated to August 22, 1996) to Applicant. The
SOR was based on Criterion J (Criminal Conduct) and Criterion E (Personal Conduct).</P>

<P>Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR, in which he indicated that he did not want a hearing. A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared and a copy
given to Applicant, who did not submit any response to the FORM. The case was then assigned to an Administrative Judge for determination.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant. The case is now before the Board on Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></P>

<P>The Administrative Judge made findings of fact about Applicant's history of criminal conduct (including theft of funds from a Navy recreation center between
early 1986 and December 1987, failure to file state income tax returns for tax years 1993 and 1994) and his knowing and willful falsification of material facts in
November 1987, June 1988, August 1995 when he falsely denied to federal investigators his involvement with the theft of the recreation center funds. On
appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Judge's factual findings. Rather, Applicant argues: (a) his theft of the recreation center funds was due to his gambling
addiction; (b) he has since filed his state income tax returns for 1993 and 1994; (c) his falsifications were due to fear of the consequences if he told the truth; and
(d) he poses no threat to the national security. The Board construes Applicant's arguments as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.<A HREF="96-0404.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A></P>

<P>The government has a compelling interest in protecting classified information, <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988), and must be able to
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information. <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980). Security
requirements include consideration of a person's honesty, judgment, and sense of his obligations. <EM>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy</EM>,
284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), <EM>aff'd</EM>, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Moreover, the government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard
classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information. <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1970), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S.
1039 (1970). Even in the absence of security violations, the government can deny or revoke an applicant's access to classified information based on conduct or
circumstances that raise substantial questions about that applicant's judgment, reliability, or suitability for access to classified information.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility follow rationally from his findings about Applicant's history of criminal
conduct and his repeated acts of knowing and willful falsification. The arguments raised by Applicant on appeal do not demonstrate that the Judge's decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>Applicant's "gambling addiction" does not extenuate or mitigate his theft of recreation center funds for purposes of evaluating his security eligibility. Given
Applicant's willingness to steal money entrusted to him to support his "gambling addiction," the Administrative Judge had a rational basis to question
Applicant's judgment, reliability, and suitability to properly handle and safeguard classified information. Similarly, given Applicant's willingness to falsify
material facts to federal investigators on three separate occasions, the Judge had a rational basis to conclude Applicant demonstrated poor judgment and
unreliability. Taken in their entirety, Applicant's actions provide an ample basis for the Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below. Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's February 4, 1997
decision.</P>

on a statement that was not in the record before him.</P>
