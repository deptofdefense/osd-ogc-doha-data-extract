<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On November 9, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 8, 2005, after the 
hearing,  Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; 
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline F had 
not been mitigated.<A HREF="02-27259.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties had not been 
mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant essentially reargues his case with respect to the limited evidence he presented below and presents new 
evidence in the form of credit reports, payment plans, receipts, and other financial documentation showing what efforts he has taken to resolve his outstanding 
debts.  The Board does not find Applicant's contention persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge obviously could not have considered the new documentary evidence that Applicant submitted for the first time on appeal in making 
his findings. The Board may not consider new evidence on appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.29.  Therefore, we may not consider Applicant's new evidence and its 
submission does not demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-12789 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the Guideline F allegations had not been mitigated.  
Although Applicant strongly disagrees with the Judge's conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for 
decision, Applicant still had significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant's financial problems 
were recent, not isolated, and still ongoing.  Moreover, the Board has previously noted that it is reasonable to expect applicants to have documentation about 
efforts to satisfy specific debts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-23511 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006).  The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.  The favorable record 
evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR 
Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines 
F is sustainable.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance.</SPAN></P>
