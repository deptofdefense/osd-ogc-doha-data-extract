<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 17, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or 
revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about September 12, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on October 3, 2001.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or 
mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on October 15, 2001, and Applicant's reply was received on 
November 13, 2001.  The case was received by the undersigned for resolution on November 15, 2001.  The issues raised here are whether the 
Applicant's alcohol consumption, and related criminal and personal conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The 
Applicant is 60 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.h., and 2.a.  The Applicant consumed alcohol with varying frequency, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from about 1960 
until he last consumed alcohol on May 4, 2001 (Government Exhibit (GX) 5 at pages 2~3, and Applicant's Response).  Initially, he "drank only 
beer, one or two cans, two or three times a week with friends" (GX 5 at page 2).  In <STRONG>January of 1971</STRONG>, he was arrested, for the first time, for 
Driving Under the Influence (DUI) (GX 3, and Applicant's Response).  Ten years later, in <STRONG>February of 1982</STRONG>, the Applicant was arrested for, and 
subsequently found guilty of, DUI (GXs 7 and 8).  Eight months later, in <STRONG>November of 1982</STRONG>, he was arrested a third time for DUI (GX 3, and 
Applicant's Response).  He was found guilty of the DUI, and also of a Probation Violation, as a result of the previous 1982 conviction (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Some 15 years later, in <STRONG>May of 1997</STRONG>, the Applicant was arrested, and subsequently found guilty of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs 
(GX 5 at pages 1~2).  "During the course of four to five hours," he admits to drinking "five cans of beer" (GX 5 at page 1).  The Applicant was 
last arrested in <STRONG>July of 1999</STRONG> (GX 5 at page 2, and GXs 6 and 9).  He pled no contest to having a Blood/Alcohol Content of .08 or more (<EM>id</EM>).  He 
admits to consuming a "large sconner(<EM>sic</EM>) (32 ounce)" of beer prior to this arrest (GX 5 at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has not demonstrated that the Applicant was also arrested in March of 1982, in November of 1983, and in December of 1983.  
Therefore, subparagraphs 1.c., 1.e. and 1.f. are found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct &amp; Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.b. and 3.a.  In answering question 24 on his July 1999 Security Clearance Application (SCA), the Applicant knowingly and wilfully failed to 
disclose his three alcohol related charges of the 1970s and the 1980s (GX 4 at page 7).  This lack of candor is a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 
1001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant offers little in the way of mitigation, except to aver that he has not consumed alcohol in the last six months.  Considering all of the 
evidence, and in light of the fact he was less than candid with the Government, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion in determining his 
suitability foe security clearance access.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, 
which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according 
to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the 
Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, 
it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to 
evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Alcohol-related incidents away rom work, such as driving while under the influence . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form 
. . . ;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the 
relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequence involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of 
record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be 
shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of 
a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that 
the past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unacceptable Personal Conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or an unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations; and Criminal Conduct also creates doubt about his judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.  The Government must be able 
to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an 
applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the 
same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's consumption of alcohol, he has a history of alcohol abuse as evidenced by five alcohol related arrests and four 
convictions.  They span a period of nearly thirty years, one occurring in 1971, two in 1982, one in 1997, and most recently, another in 1999.  
Although the Applicant now avers that he has not consumed any alcohol in the last six months, it is too soon to say that his long history of abusive 
consumption is not of present security significance.  This guideline is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was also less than candid with the Government as to his past criminal record on his July 1999 SCA.  This wilful falsification is a 
violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  This criminal conduct, coupled with his four other convictions, clearly shows a pattern of criminal conduct.  
Both Guidelines E and J are therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his Alcohol Consumption, Criminal Conduct, and 
Personal Conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E, G and J, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  
Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines E, G and J.</SPAN></P>
