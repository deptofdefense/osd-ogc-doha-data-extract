<P>Applicant is a 74-year-old supply clerk for a defense contractor.  He has a history of financial problems.  He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in 1996, and was discharged in 2000.  In 1999, he 
commenced accumulating delinquent debts, some of which still remain unpaid.  He has nearly $25,000 in state and federal income tax liens, he has a $14,000 child support arrearage, yet his 
financial statement shows a monthly surplus of about $1,500.  He falsified four questions on a security clearance application involving his financial situation.  He failed to mitigate the security 
concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct.)  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 
1960), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 25, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision - security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 10, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to 
me on September 26, 2006.  Notice of Hearing was issued on October 19, 2006.  With Applicant's permission, the hearing date was changed to November 7, 2006, and an Amended Notice was 
mailed on November 1, 2006.  I convened the hearing as re-scheduled, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  
The government offered eleven exhibits, marked as exhibits 1-11.  I kept the record open until November 27, 2006, to allow Applicant to submit any documentation.  Applicant's Exhibit A was 
received by department counsel on November 14, 2006, and the government offered no objection by memorandum dated November 27, 2006.  Applicant's Exhibit A was admitted into evidence.  
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 28, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR.  SOR subparagraph 1.a. was withdrawn at the hearing because it is a duplicate of subparagraph 1.b.  The admissions are incorporated herein 
as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: </P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant sought advice from a credit counselor, but he established no repayment plan.<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  He  made an offer-in-compromise to the IRS and the state tax agency to settle the tax liens, but the taxing 
authorities have not yet accepted them.<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  He made no payment on the other debts,<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> except the first of three settlement payments on a delinquent credit card debt (SOR subparagraph 1.g.)<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> and 
he paid that two weeks <STRONG>after</STRONG> the hearing. [Emphasis added.]  A financial statement Applicant provided investigators shows a surplus of approximately $1,500 per month after debts and expenses.<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  
A July 2006 budget shows a surplus of $832 per month.<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In answering the questions on his security clearance application, Applicant falsified material facts in his reply to the following question:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>36.  Your Financial Record - Tax Lien in the Last 7 Years.  </STRONG>Have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts?</P> 
 
<P>He answered "No," and failed to disclose that he had both state and federal income tax liens.</P> 
 
<P>He also falsified material facts in his reply to the following question:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>37.  Your Financial Record - Unpaid Judgments </STRONG> In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?</P> 
 
<P>He answered "No," failing to list the two  judgments set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Similarly, Applicant falsified material facts in his reply to the following question:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>38. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days</STRONG>  In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?</P> 
 
<P>He answered "No," failing to disclose that he had been over 180 days delinquent on debts, as set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.f. through 1.m.</P> 
 
<P>And fourth, he falsified material facts when he answered "No" to the following question:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>39.  Your Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days</STRONG>  Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?</P> 
 
<P>He failed to disclose that he was then over 90 days delinquent on debts, as set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.f. through 1.m.</P> 
 
<P>In questioning about his false answers, the following exchange took place:</P> 
 
<P>Q.  Do you recall why you answered no?</P> 
 
<P>A.  No, I don't know.  One of the things that happened there <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">I was a really trying to get the job because I wanted to have another job</SPAN> and to be able to pay some of these things.  And in filling that 
form 86, out there was a lot of things that I couldn't remember at the time.  That's not necessarily a valid excuse, it may not be a valid excuse, but I did not recall those things, a lot of those things 
that I missed.  There was some that I missed.  But I didn't have a chance to go back and to re-correct those things.  [Emphasis added.]</P> 
 
<P>Q.  And did you ever ask them about filing an amendment to your form?</P> 
 
<P>A.  No, I did not sir.  I did not ask for an amendment.  I was unaware that I could.<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>)  and FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) are applicable.  The available information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations.  He has been 
delinquent in payments on several accounts, finally resulting in his filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, but even after paying that successfully, he still has allowed debt to accumulate.</P> 
 
<P>Various conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.  The Directive sets out Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition<EM> </EM>(FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The 
conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation</EM>).  
Applicant's 1996 bankruptcy was partially the result of a divorce.  But even after he had successfully paid the debts and was discharged, he has continued to have delinquent debts, that commenced 
accruing shortly after he filed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  Delinquent taxes and alimony are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  He has signed one settlement agreement for the debt listed in SOR 
subparagraph 1.g., making the first of three installments two weeks <STRONG>after</STRONG> the hearing. [Emphasis added.]   This mitigating condition is not applicable.    </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply as 
there is no evidence that Applicant has his finances under control.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. <EM>(The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve bad debts) </EM>is not applicable.  Applicant has made one payment of three on a credit 
card settlement.  He made an offer-in-compromise to settle his tax liens, but the taxing authorities have not yet accepted them.  No other delinquent debts were paid.  He has an alimony arrearage of 
$14,000.  Yet his financial statements show anywhere from $832 to $1,500 per month surplus.  Either the financial statements are false or Applicant is spending his money rather than paying 
creditors.  Therefore, I cannot find that he has resolved his indebtedness, and I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and 
material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies.  Applicant admitted falsifying four questions on his security clearance application, because 
he wanted to get a job.  </P> 
 
<P>None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> 
<P>  "Available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination."<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> 
<P><EM>  </EM>In evaluating Applicant's case, in addition to the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, I also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.<A HREF="05-12374.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  I considered his age (74), his education 
which includes two years of college, his employment, his Army service and a decorated combat veteran of Vietnam, and what might motivate him to be less than truthful.  Applicant supplied false 
answers on a security clearance application.  This is problematic because candor with the government about a person's negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness determination.  In theory, if a person 
discloses the adverse information about himself, then he may be trusted with confidential or classified information.  Applicant's reason for withholding the negative financial data was that "I wanted 
the job."  He lied to enhance his chances of obtaining a security clearance.  He has allowed delinquent debts to accumulate and remain unpaid for as long as seven years, yet his financial statements 
show a surplus.  This raises questions about his reliability and judgment.  The totality of the record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information 
and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's security clearance.</P>
