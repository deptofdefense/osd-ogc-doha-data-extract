<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant, born in the People's Republic of China (Taiwan),  became a United States citizen in 1996.  His wife and three children are citizens of the United 
States. In 1997 and 1999, Applicant used both his Taiwanese and United States passports when traveling to Taiwan. He has now surrendered his expired 
Taiwanese passport to the Taiwanese government. Applicant's mother, father, brother, and in-laws are citizens and residents of Taiwan. None of these family 
members belong to, or are active with any government agency of Taiwan.  They are not in a position to be exploited by Taiwan in a way that could force 
Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.   </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 23, 
2004, to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings 
and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized Response to the allegations set forth in the SOR (RSOR), dated September 23, 2004, and he requested a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge. On January 3, 2005, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice, dated March 3, 2005, a hearing was 
held on March 22, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered  5 documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1- 5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant  offered 6 
documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-F) and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on April 4, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR was based on Foreign Preference (Guideline C) related to his exercise of dual citizenship with the United States and Taiwan, and Foreign Influence 
(Guideline B) concerns because of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR contains one allegation, 1.a., under Guideline C, 
and  five allegations, 2.a., through </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.e.,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, with the exception of 2.c</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">., and he gave some  
explanations</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> which will be discussed in this decision. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of 
Applicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is<EM> </EM>48<STRONG> </STRONG>years old. He is employed as a Research Scientist by a United States defense contractor that wants him to have a security clearance. He received 
a Masters and a Ph. D. degree, in Chemical Engineering from a United States university.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Taiwan in 1957 and emigrated to the United States in 1983. He became a naturalized U. S. Citizen in 1996. Applicant has three children 
who were all born in the United States and are U. S. citizens. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another 
country over the United States. The Government was concerned because Applicant used both his Taiwanese and United States passports to enter and exit 
Taiwan on two occasions in 1997 and once in 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1996, when Applicant first became a U. S. Citizen, he used only his U.S. passport when he traveled to Taiwan with his two young children. However, the 
line was extremely long and after learning that the line was far shorter if he used both passports, he decided to use both passports when entering Taiwan in 1997 
and 1999.  His U. S. and his Taiwanese passports were identified and stamped for each trip. Applicant has not traveled to Taiwan or used his Taiwanese 
passport since 1999. He does not have a current  Taiwanese passport, as it expired in 2002, and in March 2005, he and his wife surrendered their cut up 
passports to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (Exhibits D and E). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be 
bound by affection or obligation, who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are Taiwan </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> citizens and residents.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Both of them are retired and his mother is in poor health. His father was a representative of the food 
bureau of a local province in Taiwan and his mother was a homemaker. Neither of them ever worked for or had any affiliation with the Taiwan Government. 
Applicant talks to them by telephone on a weekly basis mainly to ask about their health. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  Applicant's three sisters-in-law and one brother-in-law are also</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">citizens and residents of 
Taiwan</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> None of them of them ever worked for or had any affiliation with the Taiwan Government.  Applicant has had no set contact with any of them, but may 
speak to them briefly when they call his wife. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> wife also was born in Taiwan, but she became  a naturalized U. S. Citizen on September 17, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother is a citizen and resident of Taiwan.  He is a medical doctor, and he has never worked for or had any affiliation with the Taiwan 
Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant speaks to him no more frequently than quarterly. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">came to the United States, he has </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">traveled to Taiwan on a number of occasions from 1994 to his last visit in April 1999.  The primary reason 
for his early visits was to visit his family, and his latter visits in 1996 and 1997 was to arrange the marriage and move to the United States of his current wife. 
His last visit in 1999 was to attend the funeral of his Grandmother. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was not aware of receiving any inheritance or other financial interest from Taiwan.  He has estimated his financial holdings in this country to be 
worth several hundred thousand dollars </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> introduced a letter from his supervisor. He indicated that he believed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was trustworthy and reliable. He stated, ". . . I can see that he and his 
family have established strong feelings for and loyalty to the United States of America" (Exhibit B). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of Applicant, I conclude the 
following with respect to Guidelines C and B:</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline C - Foreign Preference) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's decision to use his 
Taiwan passport raises foreign preference (Guideline C) concerns. At the time the SOR was issued, Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A3.1.2.1.), the exercise 
of dual citizenship could be argued to apply because he had used his Taiwanese passport, and DC (E2.A3.1.2.2.), possession and/or use of a foreign passport 
applied. However, Applicant has not used his Taiwanese passport since 1999, nor has he renewed his passport, and in fact he has now surrendered his cut up 
passport to the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office. I conclude that the exercise foreign citizenship was more than 5 years ago, and neither DC (E2.A3.1.2.1.) 
nor (E2.A3.1.2.) currently apply. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I resolve Guideline C for Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">are citizens and residents of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Taiwan. The Taiwan citizenship and residency of Applicant's family create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. 
The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet 
his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of existence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, who are citizens of and reside in Taiwan comes within DC (E2.A2.1.2.1), immediate family 
members, or persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, who are citizens of, or resident in, a foreign country. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including: the lack of Taiwanese government involvement of Applicant's parents, 
brother and other family members, currently and in the past, the fact that his wife is now a United States citizen, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his devotion to his children,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> his history since 
coming to the United States,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and his strong feelings concerning this country,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I have determined that his family in Taiwan do not constitute an unacceptable 
security risk, and Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1., a determination that the immediate family members in question are not agents of a foreign power or 
in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United 
States, applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         After considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline B , I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting 
the SOR and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P>
