<P>Applicant, a 58-year-old man, is seeking to retain a security clearance for his employment as a software engineer with a defense contractor. Although his last 
drug involvement (marijuana use) was in May 2001, he is unable to mitigate his more than 30-year history of illegal drug involvement. In addition, Applicant is 
unsuitable for a security clearance because the record evidence shows he misrepresented his history of illegal drug involvement in completing security-clearance 
applications and in official interviews during background investigations. Clearance is denied.   </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security 
concerns under Guideline H for drug involvement, Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification), and Guideline J for criminal conduct. Applicant replied to 
the SOR on January 19, 2005. His answers were mixed admitting in part and denying in part the SOR allegations, and he requested a hearing.  </P> 
<P>Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on June 1, 2005, and the case was assigned to me on June 13, 2005. Thereafter, a notice of hearing was 
issued scheduling the hearing for August 5, 2005. Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the transcript 
August 17, 2005. </P> 
<P><CENTER> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 58-year-old married man employed as a software engineer for a defense contractor. He is seeking to retain a security clearance. </P> 
<P>Applicant has a long-standing history of illegal drug use, which included marijuana, heroin,  speed, cocaine, and hashish. His drug of choice was marijuana. 
Applicant first became involved with illegal drug use in 1968 or 1969. His last involvement with illegal drugs was in May 2001 when he used marijuana. 
Exhibit 6 is Applicant's sworn statement wherein he detailed his history of illegal drug involvement. With two minor clarifications, Applicant admitted during 
his hearing testimony that Exhibit 6 is a true and accurate description of his illegal drug history (Transcript at 69 - 72). Accordingly, Exhibit 6 is incorporated 
herein by reference. Of note in Exhibit 6, Applicant admitted to using illegal drugs while holding a security clearance while in the Army, and while employed 
by defense contractors during 1994 - 1996. Applicant decided to stop using illegal drugs in May 2001 because he was afraid it would jeopardize his marriage, 
his job, and his holding of a security clearance. </P> 
<P>Applicant also addressed the false statements about his illegal drug history in Exhibit 6. In relevant part, Applicant admitted intentionally falsifying his answers 
about illegal drug use and involvement (purchase and sale) when he completed security-clearance applications in May 2000 (Exhibit 2), April 2001, and 
January 2002 (Exhibit 3), as well as his sworn statement in February 2002 (Exhibit 5). He stated he was untruthful because he felt ashamed and he was 
concerned his illegal drug history could keep him from obtaining a security clearance. </P> 
<P>Not addressed in Exhibit 6 was a January 1992 security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). In response to Question 20a, Applicant answered "no" thereby 
denying ever trying or using or possessing various illegal drugs, including marijuana. In response to Question 20b, Applicant answered "no" thereby denying 
ever being involved in the purchase or sale of various illegal drugs, including marijuana. Applicant's answers to both questions were false.</P> 
<P>Applicant also made false statements about his illegal drug history in interviews conducted during official background investigations. In September 1994, he 
falsely denied ever using any kind of illegal drug. In June 2000, he deliberately omitted using any kind of illegal drug despite his long-standing use of 
marijuana. And in June 2001, he deliberately omitted using illegal drug despite his long-standing use of marijuana.  </P> 
<P>Applicant presented favorable character evidence as reflected in Exhibits A, B, and C. Exhibit A is a letter from Applicant's pastor who has known Applicant 
for the past 12 years. Applicant has been very active in his church, and the pastor believes Applicant is a trustworthy and honest person. Exhibit B is a letter 
from a former supervisor who describes Applicant as an exemplary employee who he would gladly hire again. Exhibit C is a letter from Applicant's current 
supervisor who has known Applicant for about five years. The supervisor believes Applicant is a serious and dependable employee who has handled classified 
information in the past without incident. The supervisor rates Applicant as a highly valued employee of the company.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a 
determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Instead, it is determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting 
a clearance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Addressing the drug involvement under Guideline H, a security concern may exist based on improper or illegal involvement with drugs. Improper or illegal 
involvement with drugs is  relevant to an applicant's security worthiness for various reasons, including that drug abuse indicates unwillingness or inability to 
abide by the law. If a person is willing to violate the law by using  illegal drugs, it follows that person may be willing to ignore or violate the rules and 
regulations concerning the proper safeguarding and handling of classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence, the government established its case under Guideline H. A security concern is raised by Applicant's long-standing history of 
illegal drug involvement, which included the use of marijuana, heroin,  speed, cocaine, and hashish. His drug of choice was marijuana, which he used from 
about 1969 to May 2001. His illegal drug involvement also includes the purchase and sale of marijuana, although there is no evidence Applicant was a drug 
dealer.  Given these circumstances, both DC 1<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. Aggravating the situation under the whole-person concept, Applicant's 
drug abuse took place at times while he held a security clearance. The remaining DC do not apply based on the facts and circumstances here. The concern here 
is Applicant's illegal drug involvement is indicative of irresponsible behavior and poor judgment, and it calls into question his willingness or ability to follow 
the law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning to the mitigating conditions under the guideline, MC 1<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> applies in Applicant's favor. His last involvement with illegal drugs was when he last used 
marijuana in May 2001, which is more than four years. Accordingly, his illegal drug involvement may be considered not recent. Applicant also receives some 
credit under MC 3<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> based on his abstaining from using marijuana and any other illegal drug. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To sum up, I considered both the favorable and unfavorable evidence of Applicant's illegal drug involvement. After weighing the record evidence as a whole, I 
conclude the unfavorable evidence outweighs the favorable evidence, and Applicant has failed to successfully mitigate the security concern. In reaching this 
conclusion, I gave particular consideration to the nature, extent, and seriousness of Applicant's illegal drug history, his knowledgeable participation in drug 
abuse while holding a security clearance, the frequency of his drug abuse during a 30-plus-year period, and his age and maturity at the time. Accordingly, 
Guideline H  is decided against Applicant. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An omission of relevant and material information, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, 
misunderstood the question, or thought the arrest had been expunged from the record and did not need to be reported.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline E. I conclude Applicant deliberately provided false and 
misleading information about his history of illegal drug involvement when he completed security-clearance applications and during official interviews. The 
record evidence as a whole shows Applicant was a "fairly secretive" drug user (Transcript at 67) and he attempted to keep his drug involvement from the 
government. Accordingly, both DC 2<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and DC 3<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. His misrepresentations and false statements create doubt about his judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline E and conclude none apply. Falsification is a serious matter, not easily mitigated or extenuated. 
Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or 
procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline J. Applicant engaged in criminal conduct by providing false 
and misleading information about his illegal drug history in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, which is a felony offense. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given these circumstances, both DC 1<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> 
and DC 2<A HREF="03-21320.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. His criminal conduct creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. No mitigating conditions apply. 
Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I considered the evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and 
other appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.   </SPAN></P>
