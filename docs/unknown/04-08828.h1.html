<P>After her husband was physically disabled some 10 years ago, Applicant has struggled financially. Although she has paid some of the minor debts, she does not have a firm grasp on her financial 
situation. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 &para;&nbsp;E3.1.2 (Jan. 2, 1960), 
as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 2 June 2005 detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. 
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 23 June 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another judge and reassigned to me on 14 February 2006. 
On 27 April 2006, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(R.) on 9 May 2006.</P> 
 
<P>I left the record open until 12 May for Applicant to submit a letter of recommendation from her employer, who was out of town on the day of the hearing, and evidence of any payment plan with any of 
her creditors. No submission was received.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old computer technician for a defense contractor. Her husband injured his back 10 years ago and does not work outside the home. When he was injured, he was making 
approximately $8 an hour and working between 50 and 60 hours a week. Applicant, who had only worked outside the home part-time, became the family bread winner. The state provided some training 
for her in 1997, and she has worked for the same company since 1998. She has a 12-year-old daughter and a grandson at home.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information 
bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President 
authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." 
Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Jan. 6, 1993). Each security clearance decision "must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon 
consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy." Directive &para; 6.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had seven delinquent debts (&para;&para;&nbsp;1.a-1.c, 1.f-1.h) in collection status totaling more than $5,580 and one delinquent debt (&para; 1.&nbsp;d) for more than $8,530 that was 
charged off as a bad debt. In her Answer, Applicant admitted the debts in &para;&para;&nbsp;1.a, 1.c, 1.e-1.h, some with explanation. She tentatively denied the debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.b-1.c, but indicated her lack of 
certainty with a question mark.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT">An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Directive &para;&nbsp;E2.A6.1.1. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness 
and ability to protect classified information.</SPAN> The Government established that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and has been unable to satisfy her debts 
(DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A</SPAN>n applicant may mitigate financial considerations security concerns by establishing the conditions that resulted in the delinquent debts were largely beyond her control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3), she has 
received counseling and there are clear indications the problem is resolved or under control (MC E2.A6.1.3.4), or she initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her 
debts (MC E2.A6.1.3.6). Applicant established that her financial problems were largely beyond her control. The family was not in great financial condition before Applicant's husband was disabled. 
After his disability, Applicant struggled to obtain training so she could be the family bread winner. None of the other mitigating conditions apply. Although Applicant may get some financial counseling 
in the future, she has not done so yet, and there are no clear indications her problems are being resolved or are under control. She made a good-faith effort to pay some of her debts, but not others. She 
does not appear to have a full grasp of her financial situation. Under all the circumstances, I conclude Applicant has not met her burden of showing it is in the national interest to grant her a clearance. 
Once she receives financial counseling and a establishes a financial plan, she should be considered for a clearance. I find for her on &para;&para; 1.g and 1.h, which alleged debts she has paid.</P>
