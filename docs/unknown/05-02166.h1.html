<P>In 1995, Applicant incurred hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills. Her debts were discharged in bankruptcy in 1999. In 2001, she lost her job, and 
shortly thereafter incurred $11,000.00 in new medical bills. Her husband became disabled, and is still unable to work. Following their relocation in 2003, she 
found better employment. She is slowly working to pay her debt. The criminal charge against her was the result of falsification, and the warrant a result of 
miscommunication. She did not intentionally falsify her answers regarding her debt when she completed her security clearance application. She has mitigated 
the government's concerns regarding her debt and finances, her past criminal conduct, and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On September 12, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review 
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On September 29, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations, and requested 
a hearing. </P> 
<P>This matter was assigned to me on January 3, 2006. A notice of hearing was issued on January 20, 2006, and a hearing was held on February 9, 2006. Four 
government exhibits and ten Applicant exhibits were admitted into evidence. Applicant and two witnesses testified. The record was held open until March 9, 
2006 for Applicant to submit additional documentation. The additional documentation was received on February 27, 2006. The government did not object to 
the admission of this evidence, which was admitted as Applicant Exhibit J. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on February 24, 2006.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted, with explanation, all the allegations of Guideline F and Guideline J of the SOR.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated here as findings of 
fact. She denied the Guideline E allegations. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following additional 
findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old office clerk for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She has worked for this contractor for two and one-half years.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> She served three years in the

in July 2003.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant and her husband married in 1996.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She has three children by a previous marriage, one of whom is deceased.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In 1992, she decided to leave the Army 
to care for her sick mother.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Under an early out program, the Army paid her a separation bonus of $43,000.00.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> She used $27,500.00 as a down payment on a 
house.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> In the same year, her husband left the Army under an early out program and received a separation bonus of $53,000.00.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He used his money for house 
repairs and to purchase a tractor-trailer to work as a long-distance truck driver.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In 1995, Applicant's oldest daughter was diagnosed with sinus cancer.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Her daughter underwent extensive medical treatment, which cost several hundred 
thousand dollars, and was not covered by insurance.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Her daughter died a year later at the age of 16.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>While being treated for her cancer, Applicant's daughter told school authorities that her maternal grandfather had sexually abused her.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> During an interview 
with the prosecutor, Applicant's daughter stated that Applicant knew about the abuse.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>Applicant did not know about the abuse, as her daughter never said 
anything to her.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> As a result of her daughter's statement, Applicant was arrested for failure to report her child as a victim of child abuse.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> In a sworn statement, 
Applicant's daughter later recanted the allegation that Applicant knew about the sexual abuse, as well as the allegation of sexual abuse against the grandfather.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> 
The court dismissed the criminal charges against Applicant in 1996.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>For three years, Applicant and her husband continued to pay some of the voluminous debt they had incurred during her daughter's illness.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Because of the 
overwhelming debt, they finally filed for bankruptcy in 1999.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> Their debts included three accounts with one bank: a credit card account in the amount of 
$5,023.73, a line of credit for $2,034.00 and a personal loan for $1,105.30.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> In 1999, the court discharged all their debts, which were in excess of 
$100,000.00.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In July 2001, Applicant lost her job when the plant where she worked closed.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Two months later, she started work as a minimum wage cashier at a convenience 
store.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> In December 2001, she was admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital for a bleeding ulcer.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> Her medical benefit paid $1,000.00 of her bill, leaving 
approximately $11,000.00 in unpaid medical bills.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>By 2002, Applicant's husband could no longer work and is considered unemployable by his physician.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> He had suffered several heart attacks while driving on 
the road.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> He suffers from high blood pressure, emphysema, patellofemoral syndrome in both knees, diabetes, post traumatic stress syndrome, tension 
headaches, coronary artery disease, fatigue, memory loss, sleep disorder, and other medical problems.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> Because of these conditions, he takes 18 pills twice a 
day.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> He experiences side effects from the pills, including drowsiness and passing out.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The Veteran's Administration determined that Applicant's husband had a 50% service connected disability.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> The VA initially awarded him benefits in the 
amount of $633.00 a month, effective January 1, 2003, then increased his benefit to $646.00 a month, effective December 1, 2003.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> The VA has advised him 
that his entire benefit will be withheld until he has repaid the $53,000.00 separation bonus received in 1992.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> He has twice filed for social security disability 
benefits, but has been denied.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> He is awaiting a hearing before a Social Security Administration administrative law judge.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> He has no income at this time.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In April 2003, Applicant and her husband relocated from their home in another state to find better employment.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> By this time, they had lost their house to 
foreclosure.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> To her knowledge, the house has not been sold.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> They currently live with their adult daughter in the daughter's house.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In the same month, the State charged Applicant for check deception when the bank refused to pay a $15.57 check written to a fast food restaurant. Applicant 
paid the restaurant this amount plus a $30.00 service fee on December 4, 2003, after receiving the notice to pay at her new address.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> Although she notified the 
court by telephone of her new out of state address, she did not receive the trial date notice until after she was to appear in court.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> When she failed to appear, the 
court issued a warrant for her arrest in March 2004. She was unaware of the warrant until she received the SOR.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> She immediately contacted the court, and 
submitted documentation indicating that she had paid the money at issue.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> Based on this documentation, the court dismissed the check deception case and 
cancelled the warrant.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant earned $31,838.00, including overtime, in 2005.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A> Her net monthly income averages $1,750.00.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> On January 24, 2006, she began working part-time

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_113_"><SUP> (113)</SUP></A> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_114_"><SUP> (114)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_115_"><SUP> (115)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_116_"><SUP> (116)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome 
the case against her.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_117_"><SUP> (117)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_118_"><SUP> (118)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_119_"><SUP> (119)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_120_"><SUP> (120)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_121_"><SUP> (121)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_122_"><SUP> (122)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulation could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F. Applicant has a long history of excessive debt, including a bankruptcy in 1999 and a foreclosure on 
her house in 2003. After obtaining relief through Chapter 7 bankruptcy, she again, incurred significant debt which has not been paid. Applicant's financial 
problems clearly fall within the Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and 
E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>)</P> 
<P>A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated in several ways. Applicant's debt problems have been ongoing for a number of years, are not 
recent, and are not an isolated incident. Thus, she has not established a mitigating condition under Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) 
E2.A6.1.3.1. (<EM>The behavior was not recent)</EM> and E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>It was an isolated incident).</EM> Likewise, since she has not received counseling for her credit 
problems. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply.</P> 
<P>Applicant's debts, however, are a result of a series of factors beyond her control. Her oldest daughter was diagnosed with cancer in 1995 and underwent 
extensive and expensive medical treatment. Applicant did not have medical insurance which would pay for the treatment. As a result, she incurred hundreds of 
thousands of dollars of medical bills, which she and her husband tried to pay for three years. When it became clear that they could not pay their extensive debt, 
they filed for bankruptcy. The bankruptcy discharge allowed her to start again. She kept her bills current for two years. In July 2001, she lost her job when her 
work place closed. She did find a new job, which paid only minimum wage and provided minimal medical insurance coverage.</P> 
<P>In December 2001, she was hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer. Her medical insurance paid only $1,000 of the bill, leaving a significant balance for her to pay. 
Within a few months, her husband became totally disabled, and could not work. Her minimum wage job was the sole source of their income, and was 
insufficient to meet the household expenses. Applicant has presented sufficient evidence that her debt occurred because of conditions beyond her control. FC 
C E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control...</EM>) applies.</P> 
<P>She has also initiated a good faith effort to repay some of her debt. She used her most recent tax refund to pay in full some of the smaller outstanding medical 
bills. She not only has worked out a repayment plan for four more outstanding bills, she has begun making the payments. To keep her financial commitments, 
she has obtained a part-time job which will enable her to meet her monthly payment obligations. While she has not resolved all her outstanding debt issues, she 
has made a good faith effort to resolve a significant portion of her debt. The major portion of her debt is related to medical bills, not excessive spending and 
credit card debt. She only owes $707.00 in credit card debt. She still owes approximately $4,000.00 on a car loan and $938.00 on one other medical bill. FC 
C E2.A6.1.3.5. (<EM>The affluence resulted from a legal source</EM>) and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) apply.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's arrest in 1995 for failure to report child abuse is a crime under state law. In addition, her 
failure to appear in court in 2004 on a criminal misdemeanor charge resulted in a warrant for her arrest. This criminal conduct raises Criminal Conduct 
Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and 
CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</P> 
<P>The police arrested and charged Applicant in 1995 following her oldest's daughter's false statement that Applicant knew her daughter was being sexually 
abused by her grandfather. Her daughter later recanted her accusation against her mother and grandfather. The court dismissed the charges against applicant in 
1996. This unfortunate incident occurred when her daughter was seriously ill with cancer and was most likely a result of the daughter's stress and anger related 
to her illness. It has been almost ten years since these charges were dismissed by the court. Applicant has not been accused of such conduct at any other time. 
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions E2.A10.1.3.1. (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent)</EM> and E2.A10.1.3.2. (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) apply.</P> 
<P>Applicant wrote a check to a fast food restaurant which was dishonored by the bank. She was charged with check deception under state law. This matter was set 
for trial in March 2004. Although she notified the court of her new address, she did not receive the trial notice until after the scheduled trial date. Because she 
did not appear for trial, the court issued a warrant for her arrest, but never notified her. As soon as she learned about the warrant, she wrote the court and sent 
documentation showing that she had paid the check and fees. Based on her documentation, the court dismissed the check case and cancelled the warrant. The 
issuance of the warrant occurred because of miscommunication and mail problems, not through any intentional action of Applicant. Criminal Conduct 
itigating Conditions E2.A10.1.3.2. (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) applies. These two incidents, both independent of each other and one the result of a 
false accusation, are not indicative of a pattern of criminal conduct.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant's answers omitted material facts from her SF-86. She denies, however, that she 
deliberately falsified her answer to Questions 38 and 39, arguing that she referenced the existence of more debt in the general remarks section of the SF-86, and 
that she specifically listed only those debts for which she could remember all the requested information. Most of her debt information was not readily accessible 
due to her recent move. When a falsification allegation is denied, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not 
establish or prove an applicant's intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.<A HREF="05-02166.h1.html#N_123_"><SUP> (123)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant truthfully answered "yes" to both questions and identified one, but not the same, debt for each answer. She provided all the requested information on 
these debts. She stated in the remarks section that she was trying to resolve "all" her debts. While this statement does not provide specific detail about the other 
debts of Applicant, it is an admission that she owed more debt. By acknowledging additional debt even generally, she has shown that she did not intend to 
falsify her answers. Based on the information requested by the question and the lack of availability of her records, she acted reasonably when she advised that 
she was trying to resolve all her debts. I find that Applicant did not deliberately falsify her answers to Question 38 and 39. I find in favor of her under Guideline 
E of the SOR.</P> 
<P>Finally, I have considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. Applicant's ten year 
history of excessive debt resulted not from over spending, but because of a series of life changing events during an eight-year period of time. She paid her 
daughter's medical bills for three years before filing for bankruptcy in 1999. After her debts were discharged, she remained current on her bills until she lost her 
job, was hospitalized, and her husband became disabled from working. Although she found new work, she earned only minimum wage. In 2003, she and her 
husband moved to better their working opportunities. She recently obtained a part-time job to help pay her outstanding bills. She is making the appropriate 
decisions to reduce her outstanding debt, and has established a good faith effort to pay these debts. The criminal allegations by her daughter happened when the 
daughter was seriously ill, and for reasons other than the fact the child sexual abuse actually took place. Finally, the warrant for her arrest was the result of a 
series of miscommunications, not her intent to avoid prosecution. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
