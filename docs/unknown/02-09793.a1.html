  Although a pro se applicant is not expected to act like a lawyer, even a pro se applicant is expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect his or her rights under the Directive.  If an applicant fails to take timely, reasonable steps to protect his or her rights, the failure of the applicant to act does not  constitute a denial of the applicant's rights.  Having failed to respond to the File of Relevant Material or submit additional information for the Judge to  consider, Applicant cannot fairly claim she was denied the right to present evidence on her behalf.  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated August 4, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  
Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated November 19, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether Applicant was denied a reasonable opportunity to present evidence for the Administrative Judge 
to consider in her case; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant's delinquent debts were mitigated.  For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant was denied a reasonable opportunity to present evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider in her case</SPAN>.  Applicant asserts that 
because of her <EM>pro se</EM> status she failed to avail herself of the opportunity to present  evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider in her case and, therefore, 
she was not able to have the Judge consider relevant information about her case.  The Board construes Applicant's appeal statements as raising the issue of 
whether she was denied a reasonable opportunity to present evidence for the Judge to consider in her case.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is entitled to receive: (a) adequate notice of the allegations being made against her; (b) a reasonable opportunity to respond to those allegations; (c) a 
reasonable opportunity to respond to any evidence presented by Department Counsel to support the allegations against her; and (d) a reasonable opportunity to 
present evidence on her own behalf for the Administrative Judge to consider in her case.  A review of the case file indicates Applicant was provided with all 
those procedural rights.</P> 
 
<P>Although a <EM>pro se</EM> applicant cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, even a <EM>pro se</EM> applicant is expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect his or her 
rights under the Directive.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0593 (May 14, 2001) at p. 4.  If an applicant fails to take timely, reasonable steps to protect his or her 
rights, the failure of the applicant to act does not constitute a denial of the applicant's rights.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-19896 (December 29, 2003) at p. 6.  
Because Applicant did not respond to the File of Relevant Material (FORM) or submit additional information for the Administrative Judge to consider in her 
case, the Judge properly based his decision on the case record that was before him.  Having failed to respond to the FORM or submit additional information for 
the Judge to consider, Applicant cannot fairly claim she was denied the right to present evidence on her behalf.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant's delinquent debts were mitigated</SPAN>.  Applicant makes various statements in her appeal 
brief which the Board construes as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant's delinquent debts were mitigated.<A HREF="02-09793.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>A review of the Administrative Judge's decision shows the Judge considered the facts and circumstances of Applicant's history of financial difficulties and 
reached reasonable conclusions about Applicant's financial conduct.  Furthermore, the Judge gave an explanation for why he concluded Applicant had failed to 
mitigate the security concerns raised by her history of unresolved financial difficulties.  Nothing in Applicant's appeal brief persuades the Board that the Judge 
analyzed her case in a manner that is arbitrary or capricious, or contrary to pertinent provisions of the Directive.</P>

<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Therefore, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>
