<P>Applicant's foreign contacts, specifically his father-in-law who is a retired Rear Admiral in the Japanese Navy, raise a security concern that has not been 
mitigated.  Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On November 7, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 25, 2002, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.   
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on January 30, 2003.  The Applicant was instructed to 
submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on February 11, 2003, and he submitted a 
reply dated February 17, 2003.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on March 21, 2003. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the testimony.  The Applicant is 36 years of age and is employed 
as a Software Engineer for a  defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign 
contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</P> 
<P>The Applicant's wife was born in Japan and is a citizen of Japan.   She came to the United States in May 1996, on a student visa, and has resided in the United 
States since then.  The Applicant met his wife while she was attending college.  After graduating from college in July 2000, the Applicant's wife began working 
as a nurse at a University Medical Center in the United States.  She and the Applicant were married in June 2001.  She has had Permanent Resident status since 
August 2001.  The Applicant states that his wife will apply for citizenship when she is eligible.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 3).  </P> 
<P>The Applicant's mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law and brother-in-law are also citizens of Japan and reside there.  The Applicant's father-in-law was a 
Rear Admiral in the Japanese Navy before he retired in March 1986.  There is no information in the record as to whether he is still affiliated in any way with the 
Japanese Government.  His sister-in-law is a homemaker and his brother-in-law is a businessman.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 5).  </P> 
<P>The Applicant does not speak Japanese, and thus communication with his in-laws is difficult because they speak very little English.  Even with his wife 
translating for him his communications are minimal and infrequent.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 3).  The Applicant's wife contacts her parents in Japan on a 
monthly basis by telephone.  She contacts her sister in Japan by e-mail about once per week.  </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></P> 
<P>1. An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
<P>1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between the loyalty of the 
person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</P> 
<P>a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P> 
<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
<P>  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P> 
<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P> 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
<P>i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</P> 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</P> 
<P>The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with 
respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P> 
<P>Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P> 
<P>An individual who has foreign connections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  
Foreign influence can raise  questions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another 
nation. The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's foreign contacts have a direct 
and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </P> 
<P>With respect to Guideline B, the evidence establishes that the Applicant may be vulnerable to foreign influence.  The Applicant's spouse, with whom he lives, 
is a citizen of Japan.  She also maintains regular contact with her family in Japan.  The Applicant's contacts with his wife's family are minimal, but may be of a 
nature to influence his security worthiness.  The fact that his father-in-law was a Rear Admiral in the Japanese Navy raises a security concern that has not been 
mitigated.  Although his father-in-law is now retired, the Applicant has not explained whether his father-in-law is still associated in any way with the Japanese 
Government.    It is not clear whether his father-in-law has cut all contact with the Japanese Government or whether he now operates as a consultant.  The 
burden of proof on this point is on the Applicant, and the record does not contain any information as to his father-in-law's present status.  The record is devoid 
of this information.  Therefore, the Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he is not in a position to be exploited by Japan in a way that 
could force the Applicant to choose between loyalty to them and loyalty to the United States.  Based on the foregoing, this  raises a security concern and 
Guideline B is found against the Applicant.   </P> 
<P>Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</P>

for the Applicant.</P>
