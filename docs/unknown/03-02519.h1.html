<P>Applicant had five dependents and was "trying to live the American dream by buying whatever [he] wanted" using credit cards, but was only earning $10 an 
hour.  Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns raised by his delinquent debts.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 25 November 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-02519.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 29 December 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 8 
arch 2004.  On 24 May 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 4 June 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old computer hardware and software technician for a defense contractor working at a military installation.  He graduated from college in 
1985.  In 1995, he married a woman who was bearing his child.  Tr. 28.  She brought two other children into the marriage.  Applicant was only earning $9 an 
hour at the time, later raised to $10 an hour, but was still "trying to live the American dream buying whatever [he] wanted; often using credit cards."  Ex. 2 at 1; 
Tr. 28.  In May 1998, a son was born to the couple.  Applicant now had six mouths to feed.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant was divorcing his wife.</P> 
<P>In 1999, Applicant purchased a house.  The mortgage payments, not including property taxes, exceeded his ability to pay by about $100 a month.  A check for 
$920 for property taxes bounced and, because he "needed the money for other things," Applicant did not contact the county about the taxes.  He eventually 
received two additional bills for taxes in 2000 and 2001, making the total owed $3,236.  He never paid the tax debt.  Ex. 2 at 2. In October 2002, he set up a 
budget. </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent debts the creditors had turned over to collection agencies (&para;&para; 1.a and 1.b), a delinquent debt to a physician 
(&para; 1.c), a debt resulting from the foreclosure on his house (&para; 1.d), and he is not in a financial position to make payments on his delinquent debts (&para; 1.e).  An 
applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has a history of not meeting his 
financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The cause of his debts, by his own admission, is 
living beyond his means.  Applicant was unable to prove that he had paid any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, that he had formal plans to pay these 
debts, that he is in a financial condition to pay these debts, or that he is actively seeking a resolution of these debts.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.  I 
find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
