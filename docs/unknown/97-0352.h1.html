</P>

<P>	On May 19, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated June 16, 1997, the Applicant responded to
the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  A copy of the SOR is attached to this
Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on July 28, 1997.  The
undersigned held a hearing on September 9, 1997.  The Department Counsel presented twelve
exhibits ("Exhs") and the testimony of no witnesses.  The Applicant's case consisted of the
presentation of nine exhibits and the testimony of no witnesses besides his own.  A tenth exhibit,
identified as exh. J, consisting of 17 pages of miscellaneous documents provided on September 22
and 23, 1997, by facsimile, was admitted without objection.  The undersigned Administrative Judge
received the transcript ("Tr") of the hearing on September 30, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	SOR &para; 1.g. was amended at the hearing to correct the spelling of the creditor's name, and
SOR &para; 1.k. was amended at the hearing to correct the date of the filing of certain notices of
assessments and liens to May 31, 1984.  Tr pages 114-116, 190, 248-251.  An eleventh exhibit,
identified as exh. K, consisting of five pages of miscellaneous documents provided on October 1,
1997, by facsimile, was excluded from the evidentiary record upon objection by the Department
Counsel on the basis that the record was closed as of September 23, 1997.  Tr pages 142-146.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following single
criterion: paragraph 1, Criterion F (financial considerations).  The Applicant has admitted with
explanations<A NAME="admitted or denied subparas.?"></A> the factual allegations contained in &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.c., inclusive, &para; 1.f., and &para;&para; 1.h.
through 1.j., inclusive.<A NAME="€ & letter of subparas."></A> of the SOR.  Except as noted herein, the Applicant's admissions are hereby
incorporated as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	The Applicant is a 45-year-old computer-assisted exercise coach employed by a U.S.
Government contractor.  The Applicant seeks to retain a Secret personnel security clearance.</P>

<P>	The Applicant graduated from college in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in business
administration.  He married in 1978 and then adopted his wife's twin 5-year-old daughters.  The
couple have a son born in 1980 with a seizure disorder.  Their financial difficulties started in 1987
when the Applicant's wife was handling their checkbook, and their debts exceeded $30 thousand. 
They succeeded in completely paying off their creditors during 1987-91 through Consumer Credit
Services.  However, they were unable to pay their Federal income tax obligations in full for tax years
1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1995.  Together with interest and penalties, their past due Federal
income tax obligations total about $35 thousand.   In September 1997, they made an offer in
compromise to pay $265.38 a month to pay off the tax indebtedness, but the IRS has not yet accepted
their offer.  Exh. C.  Tr pages 147-151. His wife persuaded the Applicant to make the offer in
compromise at that time.  Tr pages 160-167.</P>

<P>	In addition to major medical treatment and psychiatric costs and private schooling expenses
incurred for the Applicant's son, who has been diagnosed with depression and attention deficit
disorder, the Applicant also continues to have recurring psychiatric expenses for his wife, who was
diagnosed in 1990 with multiple personality disorder.  The Applicant quit his job in 1990,
erroneously thinking that he would be called up from the reserves for Operation Desert Storm.  Tr
pages 121-122.  He and his wife separated in about the 1990-91 period on the advice of her therapist. 
During the four month separation she ran up a $10 thousand consumer debt, apparently acting in the
personality of one who was a rich person.  She attempted suicide sometime in 1991-92, and their son
attempted suicide in October 1996.  Tr pages 91-93, 138-139.  When the Applicant's wife reconciled
with the Applicant in 1991, she entered college and ultimately graduated--with substantial state
financial aid--in December 1995 with a bachelor's degree in nursing.  Tr page 169.  She is presently
working on her master's degree in nursing as well as holding a full-time nursing job at a hospital. 
The Applicant and his wife have also incurred college expenses for their twin daughters in the early
1990's.  They also paid for the weddings of each of their daughters in July 1996 and April 1997,
which cost about $5 thousand each.</P>

<P>	In March 1997 the Applicant's wife had a relapse in which she bounced some checks and ran
up a $3 thousand consumer debt (using one of her daughter's credit cards) before the Applicant
discovered it in May 1997.  Her psychiatrist told her that she was a "spending addict."  Tr pages 90,
152, 176.  Whenever she goes off on a spending binge, the Applicant eventually discovers it and
pays off--or tries to pay off--the debts and bounced checks.  Tr page 148.  Since 1994 the Applicant
and his wife have lived in different cities during the work week and live together on weekends.  Tr
pages 98-105.  He pays $60 monthly for his cable TV and $31 monthly for her cable TV.  He bought
a used 1996 automobile for his wife in June 1997 and is obligated to make a $360 monthly car loan
payment.  He gives about $100 a month to his church.  Tr pages 125-132.  The Applicant still owes
almost $1 thousand for a city street improvement assessment, including interest and penalties, that
dates back to 1984.  He last made a partial payment on the assessment sometime in 1993-95.  Tr
pages 135-136.<A HREF="97-0352.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  After the hearing on September 9, 1997, the Applicant paid $220 to settle one past
due bill dating from July 1994 and also paid a $115 medical bill from 1994.<A HREF="97-0352.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  His son was admitted
to a treatment facility from September 17 to September 22, 1997.</P>

<P>	The Applicant acknowledges that he is responsible financially for his wife's spending and
debts.  Tr pages 182-183.  Because she has a larger income than he has, he defers to her on some
financial matters and continues to allow her to write checks on their joint checking account.  Tr
pages 232, 235, 242-245.  The couple have an estimated current annual gross income of $80+
thousand and a net estimated annual take-home pay of $56+ thousand (excluding, <STRONG><EM>inter alia</EM></STRONG>, their
tax-deferred 401(k) and 403(b) retirement contributions).  Exh. D.  Tr page 235.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative
guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines
are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant
or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P>	The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an
evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION F - FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence
is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal
acts.</STRONG></P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include:</STRONG> </P>

<P>			  (1)	a history of not meeting financial
obligations; </P>

<P>			  (3)	inability or unwillingness to satisfy
debts;</P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </P>

<P>			  (3)	the conditions that resulted in the behavior were
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of em-ployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</P>

<P>			  (6)	the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</P>

<P>	The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors
enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequences involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur
in the future.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following
factors:</P>

<P>		The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes</P>

<P>		The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>		The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding
that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences
and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations
under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>		It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government
to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of
the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the
Board in second-guessing the agency's national security
determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that
Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence
that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial
evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of
the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0352.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose
of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation
of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an
applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold
a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0352.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of the Applicant who testified, the
undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criterion F.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant has had a lengthy history of not meeting his financial obligations and at times
an inability to pay his debts in a timely manner--at other times an unwillingness to contact his
creditors and arrange to pay past due debts.  This conduct falls within the scope of DC #1 and DC
#3, which are identified at page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  Paying past due debts after an SOR is issued, or on the
very eve of a hearing to determine his security clearance eligibility, or otherwise when one is pressed
"to the wall" or "under the gun," does little to satisfy the mitigating circumstance of a good faith
("<STRONG><EM>bona fide</EM></STRONG>") efforts to resolve past due debts  <EM>See</EM> MC #6, which is identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>. 
Security clearance eligibility requires a reasonable degree of fidelity to one's creditor by contacting
the creditor and by attempts to arrange a payment schedule, a reduction in the total amount owed,
and/or partial payments as a priority within one's resources.  A modest life-style and appropriate
changes in one's  financial habits to accommodate the discharge of one's past due debts would
contribute to a demonstration of such good faith efforts.  Here the Applicant continues to allow his
wife to write checks on a joint checking account, for which he acknowledges he is financially
obligated, even though he knows that she has had a history of spending binges and "relapses" and
has proven that she cannot handle finances responsibly.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant put off dealing with the IRS on his large past due income tax obligations until
after he had paid for his daughters' weddings.  Exh. 4.  He has been steadily employed since
November 1994 in his present job, yet he owes the IRS about $4 thousand in income tax for tax year
1995.  Exh. 2.  He has taken what amounts to "forced loans" from the IRS during tax years 1988-91
by not paying the tax balances due.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Failure to pay one's income taxes in a timely fashion to the government may be a significant
indication of an individual's sense of his civic duty, which in turn has considerable relationship to
that individual's security clearance eligibility.  Failure to contact the IRS to make an offer in
compromise and arrange a payment schedule until his personnel security clearance dangles in his
face in the balance does not show the sense of obligation required of those entrusted with classified
information.  Indeed, the magnitude of the Appellant's debts are not disproportionate to his current
income.  He simply put off his creditors until "a sunny day."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant has had a series of medical expenses, some of which were not covered by
insurance.  He has had to pay for private schooling of his disabled son without financial assistance
from the local school district.  This raises the question of the applicability of MC #3, which is
identified at page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  However, these recurring financial problems cannot be concluded to be
wholly unexpected or aberrational in the sense of being impossible to save or plan for.  The
Applicant and his wife each have medical insurance through their places of employment. 
Circumstances beyond a person's control may mitigate the government's financial concerns where
the individual has taken appropriate steps to respond the circumstances in a responsible and
reasonable manner.  Here the Applicant allowed medical bills from several years ago to remain
unpaid.  Based on the evidence in the record, the Applicant has not sustained his burden of
persuasion that the government's financial concerns are fully mitigated.</FONT></P>

<P>	The Directive requires that the factors listed in Section F.3 and enclosure 2 to the Directive,
identified on page 5 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, be considered, as appropriate, in making this decision.  The nature and
seriousness of the Applicant's debt is considerable.  The duration and currency of that debt is
significant, and the probability of its continuance or recurrence is likely.  The Applicant worked his
way out of $30+ thousand in debts through Consumer Credit Services in 1987-91.  He knew how 
to do so again if and when he was able, but he largely failed to pay his creditors or otherwise resolve
his debts, particularly his past due income tax obligations, until his security clearance eligibility was
placed in the balance.  Accordingly, Crierion F is concluded adversely to the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></CENTER>

<P>	Formal findings as required by Enclosure 1 of the Directive (see paragraph (7) of section 3
of Executive Order 10865, as amended) and the additional procedural guidance contained in item
