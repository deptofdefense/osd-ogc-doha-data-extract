<P>Applicant pleaded guilty to a single count of insurance fraud in December 2002 following his arrest and charge of insurance fraud and grand theft.  His 
continued denial of responsibility for his offense, when coupled with his probationary status and relative recency of the misbehavior, precludes crediting 
Applicant with successful reform and mitigation.  While Applicant is to be commended for the positive steps he has taken in meeting his probationary 
conditions, more time  needed for Applicant to demonstrate his full restoration to levels of judgment and trust required to hold a security clearance.  Applicant 
fails to mitigate the security concerns associated with his September 2002 insurance fraud incident.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 23, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA ), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on February 16, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on April 21, 2004, and was initially scheduled for 
hearing on May 12, 2004, before being rescheduled for June 24, 2004.  A hearing was convened on June 24, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it 
would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case 
consisted of eight exhibits.  Applicant relied on three witnesses (including himself) and two exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on July 7, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is alleged to have been arrested in September 2002 and charged with (1) insurance fraud and (2) grand theft, to which he pled 
guilty to Count I (Count II was dismissed) and was sentenced to three years probation, 75 hours of community service and assessed costs and restitution totaling 
$1,636.14.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations that undercut his guilty plea with claims of innocence.  Essentially, he 
claimed to have informed the insurance agent of his accident before being told by his insurance agent that his policy was being renewed.  He provided a detailed 
summary of his version of his conversations with both his insurance agent and a state insurance investigator who subsequently interviewed him about his 
insurance claims and the decision by his carrier not to renew his insurance.  Applicant claimed he later pleaded guilty to insurance fraud on the advice of 
counsel and was awarded deferred adjudication, 18 months of probation, 75 hours of community service and assessed restitution.  He claimed to have 
completed 15 months of probation and 80 hours of community service, and was still paying on his restitution. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 37-year-old system administrator for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While on his way home on December 16, 2001 (at around 5:30 P.M.), Applicant struck a deer, disabling his vehicle.  Both police and a tow truck operator 
arrived shortly thereafter.  Unbeknownst to Applicant, the police filed a traffic crash report of the incident.  The tow truck that arrived at the scene, in turn, 
towed Applicant and his vehicle to a nearby repair shop.  At approximately 7:37 P.M. on December 16, 2001, Applicant called his insurance agent to check on 
his coverage and was told his insurance had lapsed .  Without advising his insurance agent (for Company A) of the accident he was involved in two hours 
previous, he applied for a new policy.  Based in part on Applicant's assurances to the agent, his application for a new policy was accepted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed a claim the following morning (<EM>i.e., </EM>on December 17, 2001, at around 9:39 A.M.) with his insurance company on his new insurance policy re: 
his December 16 accident.  The carrier assigned a claim number for the reported loss, which Applicant claimed occurred between 11:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M. on 
December 16, 2001.  The insurance agent who took Applicant's  report  (Agent  A) then checked the dates and times of Applicant's reported accident with the 
information contained in the filed police report he had obtained from the towing company's tow slip and found discrepancies in Applicant's claimed incident 
time.  Agent A then referred his findings to the insurance company's special investigative unit, who later (in March 2002) referred the matter to the State's 
insurance fraud division for consideration of criminal prosecution against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After finding discrepancies in Applicant's reported time of the accident, Agent A called Applicant back (sometime in mid-morning of December 17, 2001) to 
reconcile his divergent account.  Confronted with conflicting accounts, Applicant (a) acknowledged police coming to the scene, (b) couldn't explain his 
providing a 11:00 P.M. to 1:00 A.M. time frame for the accident in the face of the reported 5:30 P.M. time in the police report, and &copy;)  refused to relent on his 
obtaining a new policy the day before the accident (<EM>i.e., </EM>on December 15, 2001).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Agent A took an additional recorded statement from Applicant on December 17, 2001.  In this statement, Applicant insisted he had obtained his insurance 
policy before the December 16 accident had occurred (<EM>i.e., </EM>on December 15, 2001), but did not actually buy a policy from the carrier until after the accident had 
happened on December 16, 2001 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a law enforcement investigator for the State's insurance fraud division, who had left her card at his home earlier in 
the day (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).  In her recorded interview of Applicant upon returning to his residence (after first reading him his perjury and oath and Miranda warnings), 
the investigator elicited an admission from Applicant that his insurance policy had lapsed for non-payment of two due insurance premiums.  Applicant advised 
her that he had tried to make payment on his policy the preceding Sunday (December 15, 2001) but was told he would have to obtain a new policy due to a 
lapse of the old one.  He then acknowledged obtaining his new policy on the evening of December 16, 2001, after the accident had occurred (ex. 3).  These 
statements he provided the State insurance investigator contradict the explanations he provides in both his DSS statement (ex. 2) and SOR answer.  Applicant's 
statements to the insurance investigator also  provided the basis for the ensuing felony charges filed against him for insurance fraud and grand theft.<A HREF="03-12903.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Because 
the insurance policy  remained in effect for the balance of December 16, 2001 and some of the following day (based on the account of the insurance 
investigator), Applicant must be held responsible for actually receiving and potentially benefitting  from a policy that was based on inaccurate information 
supplied by Applicant re: the timing of his accident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Based on the affidavit provided by the State insurance investigator, the State filed charges against Applicant for insurance fraud (Count I) and grand theft 
(Count II), both felonies, in December 2001 (ex. 4).  The criminal complaint cites Agent A of Applicant's insurance company as the complaining person.  
Applicant, in turn, was arrested on September 21, 2002, on an outstanding warrant and transported to a local jail facility pending transfer to the neighboring 
jurisdiction where the charges were pending.  Applicant reported the incident to his employer's security representative who wrote up an adverse information 
report on the incident (s<EM>ee</EM> ex. 7).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">When Applicant appeared in court in December 2002, he pled guilty to insurance fraud.  The remaining charge of grand theft was dismissed.  Upon accepting 
Applicant's plea, the court hearing Applicant's case withheld adjudication of guilt as a part of his sentence that entailed three years probation, 75 hours of 
community service, and assessment of costs and restitution for the cost of supervision (<EM>compare </EM>exs 8 and B).  Exhibit B contains a correction to the original 
order (ex. 8) that did not confirm withholding of adjudication of guilt.  Applicant has since completed his ordered 75 hours of community service and has been 
fully compliant with his probation conditions: drug testing (consistently negative) and regular payments towards his court-ordered monetary obligations.  
Applicant is also credited with maintaining stable employment and a residence, in addition to remaining arrest free (<EM>see</EM> ex. A; R.T., at 57-60). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Once his restitution is satisfied, Applicant would  be positioned to seek an early termination of his probation, which courts typically entertain according to his 
probation officer (R.T., at 74-75).  It is still too speculative at this time, however, to estimate Applicant's likelihood of success on such a request, should it be 
made.  At the moment, Applicant still has 17 months remaining on his probation (<EM>see</EM> ex. A; R.T., at 76).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Applicant is highly regarded by the course director for the systems administrator course that Applicant is assigned to: Applicant is one of her systems 
instructors.  The course director was not familiar with the incident for which he was criminally charged (R.T., at 51-52). </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">material bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified 
information before it can deny or revoke a </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">security clearance.  Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Applicant had no prior history of criminal arrests before his September 2002 arrest for insurance fraud and grand theft.  The insurance fraud charges he pled 
guilty to in December 2002 were serious, though, and covered conduct of a felonious nature.  Even without an adjudication of guilt, Applicant's admissions of 
the underlying insurance fraud charges are security significant and raise security concerns under Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Fully advised of the charges against him, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count of insurance fraud (associated with the September 2001 incident) and was 
placed on three years of supervised probation. The incident, though isolated, is a serious one and warrants the application of two of the disqualifying conditions 
(DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct: DC 1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct) and DC 2 (a single serious or multiple lesser 
offenses).  Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust in those it bestows access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States, </EM>444 U.S. 507, 
511 n.6 (1980).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Applicant's 2002 insurance fraud offense is not only serious but is aggravated by his failure to acknowledge guilt or responsibility.  To the contrary, he takes 
issue with the insurance investigator's version of Applicant's applying for and obtaining a new insurance policy without disclosing the accident he was involved 
in just hours before.  That his guilty plea is not subject to collateral estoppel absent a conviction does not change the clear impression that Applicant is still 
unwilling to accept responsibility for his misconduct unless ordered to do so by a court of law as a condition of his awarded probation.  This undercuts the 
diligence he has displayed in meeting his probation conditions.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Applicant's completion of most of his probation conditions, while commendable, is not enough to demonstrate clear evidence of rehabilitation.  Applicants 
historically can be expected to exhibit good behavior while on probation.  <EM>Cf. Domingues  v. Dept. Air Force, </EM>803 F.2d 680, 683-84 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (in 
evaluating good behavior since misconduct it may be noted that employees can be expected to exhibit their best behavior when faced with the strong possibility 
the agency will be acting soon to remove them); ISCR Case No. 90-1115 (October 1992).  Time elapse without further incidents are important factors in 
gauging the quality of Applicant's rehabilitation. And, certainly, acknowledgments of guilt and responsibility are highly material considerations to take into 
account in progress assessments. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">  Neither sufficient time elapse without further incident nor demonstrated acceptance of responsibility aid Applicant in his making the case for rehabilitation 
from the trust loss he experienced as a consequence of his insurance fraud incident.  Not only has Applicant failed to take responsibility for his behavior leading 
to his guilty plea, but he still has almost 17 months remaining on his probation.  That Applicant will remain on probation until 2005 cannot be disregarded.  His 
continuing probation status serves to further undercut his claims of successful reform and rehabilitation.  While nothing in the Directive indicates that an 
applicant's probationary status is a <EM>per se </EM>bar to a favorable security clearance, it is a consideration to take into account when weighing an applicant's reform 
and rehabilitation claims (as here).  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case No. 96-0710 (June 1997).  Here, several factors militate against crediting Applicant with mitigation of the 
misconduct covered by his September 2002 arrest: his absence of acceptance of responsibility for his actions, his continued probation status, the seriousness of 
the offense covered by the SOR and the relative recency of his actions.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">So, based on the evidence presented, Applicant may invoke several of the mitigating conditions covered by the Adjudicative Guidelines for criminal conduct, 
but not to their fullest extent: MC 1 (behavior not recent), MC 2 (isolated incident) and MC 6 (there is clear evidence of rehabilitation).  MC 6, in particular, has 
very limited applicability in view of lack of accountability for his actions and unfinished probation requirements.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's 2002 insurance fraud incident, his continued insistence on innocence, his still active 
probation status, and the relative recency of the conduct when weighed against the seriousness of the trust breach, it is too soon to conclude Applicant is no 
longer at risk to recurrent behavior in the foreseeable future.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by Guidelines J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative 
Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 9pt"></SPAN></P>
