<P>Applicant had liabilities discharged in bankruptcy in 1994.  Nevertheless, he continues to have financial problems.  He has delinquent debts totaling over 
$4,700, he does not have the resources to pay these debts, and does not have a firm understanding of his financial situation.  Applicant failed to mitigate the 
security concerns raised by his financial situation and his deliberate omission of his financial problems from his security clearance application.  Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 8 December 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-09483.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 30 December 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative 
judge.  The case was assigned to me on 7 April 2004.  On 25 May 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 4 June 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old operations assistant technician, serving on a military base as a scheduler, for a defense contractor.  He is divorced and has two 
children, 13 and 16 years old, who live with him.  Tr. 13.  Applicant retired from the Air Force as an E-5 in 2001.  Tr. 13-14; Ex. 1 at 4. </P> 
<P>In 1994, at the suggestion of their attorneys, Applicant and his first wife<A HREF="03-09483.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy before they divorced.  Tr. 27-28.  In July 1994, the 
court discharged approximately $22,000 in liabilities owed by Applicant and his first wife.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 28.  Applicant purchased a washer and dryer and other items 
from a military exchange on a deferred payment plan.  Applicant did not make regular payments on the plan.  He was often late with his payments and was 
delinquent more than 90 days on more than three occasions.  SOR &para; 1.b; Ex. 2 at 1.  The military exchange charged off the debt of $2,071 in October of 2001.  
Ex. 2 at 1.  The IRS applied $1,009.20 from his income tax refunds in 2003 and 2004 toward payment of the debt.  Exs. 4, A.</P> 
<P>Applicant purchased a computer in 1998.  He sent it back to the company for repairs, but it still did not work when he got it back.  He stopped paying on it.  In 
November 1999, after Applicant had been more than 120 days late in paying on at least two occasions, the company charged off the debt.  SOR &para; 1.a; Ex. 2 at 1.  
Applicant says he contacted the company and they have agreed to send him a bill, but he has not received it yet.  He states that he intends to pay the bill and is 
financially able to do so.  Tr. 15.</P> 
<P>Applicant opened an account with a bank in 1998.  In September 2001, the bank charged off $752.  SOR &para; 1.c; Ex. 2 at 1.  Applicant says he will pay the debt if 
he still owes it.  Tr. 18.</P> 
<P>Applicant is indebted to another creditor for $78. The account was opened in April 1995 and is now in collection status.  </P> 
<P>Applicant completed a security clearance application on 21 February 2002.  Question 38 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been delinquent 
more than 180 days in paying any of his debts.  Question 39 asked if Applicant was then delinquent more than 90 days on any debts.  Applicant answered "no" 
to both questions.  Ex. 1 at 7.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent debts that were in collection or charged off status (&para; 1.a-1.d) totaling approximately $4,700 and had debts 
discharged in bankruptcy in 1994 (&para; 1.e).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive 
&para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC 
E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3).  Applicant does not have a firm grasp on his financial situation.  He claims he is 
working on paying the debt alleged in &para; 1.a, but has no corroboration.  He believes his debt to the military exchange is now fully paid, but has no evidence to 
support his position.  He asserts the debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.c and 1.d should have been discharged in his 1994 bankruptcy, but neither account was opened until 
after the bankruptcy was finalized.  He says he will pay the debt alleged in &para; 1.a, but clearly does not have the resources to do so.  He arranged with the 
company to resolve the delinquency by paying $200 every two weeks, but he is delinquent more than 30 days on the payment plan.  Tr. 23-24. And Applicant 
admitted to a more recent delinquent debt, not included in the SOR, to a credit card company of approximately $2,500.  Some of Applicant's debts may have 
resulted from his divorces, which were largely beyond his control.  MC E2.A5.1.3.3.  But he has not shown significant movement toward resolving the debts.  
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his financial situation.  I find against Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose he had debts in the last seven years that were 
delinquent more than 180 days (&para; 2.a) and, at the time he completed the SCA, debts that were delinquent more than 90 days.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may 
not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA that, in the previous seven years, he had debts delinquent more 
than 180 days and debts that were then delinquent more than 90 days.  Proof Applicant omitted this information from his SCA shifted the burden to Applicant 
to explain the omissions sufficiently to negate a finding of knowing and deliberate falsification.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he failed to answer questions 38 and 39 on his SCA correctly because "the security guy was pushing to get the paperwork done before he left."  
Tr. 22.  Applicant is not young and inexperienced.  He served 20 years in the U.S. armed forces and completed an SCA as far back as 1982.  After carefully 
observing his demeanor and listening to his excuse, I did not find his explanation credible.  Applicant failed to provide credible reasons for his failure to 
accurately complete the SCA.  I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>
