<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue Applicant's eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position. As required by 
Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, 
<EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on November 27, 2006, detailing the basis for its decision-concerns raised under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense 
effective September 1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 26, 2006, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The 
case was assigned to me on February 1, 2007. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on February 8, 2007, scheduling the hearing for</SPAN> February 28, 2007. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing 
was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant </SPAN>or continue Applicant's eligibility to occupy an ADP 
I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government offered three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, and admitted without objection. 
Applicant testified but did not submit any documentary evidence. </SPAN>DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 12, 2007.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a federal government contractor. Applicant is married and has three natural children and an adopted child, all adults.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Liberia. He attended an American university. Since he graduated college, Applicant has spent many years in the United States, while 
occasionally returning to Liberia to live. From about 1987 to about 1990, Applicant worked as a civil servant for a Liberian government ministry. When civil 
war broke out, Applicant moved with his family to the United States in 1990. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2002.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Liberia was settled by freed slaves from the United States in 1820. In 1980, the Liberian government was overthrown by a military coup d'etat. The 
government retained close relations with Washington despite ethnic tensions, frequent hostilities, human rights abuses and fraud. </P> 
 
<P>In 1989, Liberia was invaded by rebels from the Ivory Coast, initiating a bloody civil war that continued until 1996. Over 200,000 people were killed and a 
million others were displaced to neighboring countries. Civil war resumed in 1999, and continued until 2003. This second civil war left most of the country 
without electricity and running water, and three quarters of the population unemployed and illiterate. The presidential election in 2005 was considered generally 
fair and peaceful.</P> 
 
<P>Notwithstanding recent democratic elections, Liberia is still considered a volatile country and its infrastructure remains basically nonexistent. The civil wars 
devastated the economy. Additionally, there is a high rate of crime, which is exacerbated by the very high rate of unemployment. Despite peacekeeping forces, 
American citizens have been targets of crime and the police are considered to be ill equipped and incapable of providing protection. The U.S. Department of 
State currently warns American tourists that there remains an undercurrent of political and social tension and economic hardship that could result in sporadic 
violence and instability. Also, Liberia continues to have a poor record with respect to human rights. Human rights abuses include ritualistic killings and deaths 
from mob violence, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture, societal ethnic discrimination, trafficking in persons, and official corruption and impunity. </P> 
 
<P>While the U.S. has had good relations with Liberia, and between 2004 and 2006, it poured over a billion dollars into Liberia to assist refuges and internally 
displaced persons, the President recently extended a July 2004 Executive Order prohibiting the importation of certain goods from Liberia. The depletion of 
Liberian resources, funds, and property continue to undermine Liberia's transition to a fully democratic government and an orderly society and pose a 
continuing and extraordinary threat to the foreign policy of the United States. There was also one espionage case involving Liberia.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In addition to the <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">administrative notice of the specific facts contained in HE VIII</SPAN>, I take additional administrative notice of the following facts as related to 
Liberia and espionage cases. Liberia  counts the United States as its strongest supporter in its democratization and reconstruction efforts.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PERSEREC 
Technical Report </SPAN>lists one instance of espionage involving Liberia. While most of the countries involved in espionage were adversarial to the U.S. at the time of 
the espionage, neutral or friendly countries in every region of the world, from Asia to Africa, the Middle East to Central America, including some of our close 
allies in Western Europe, have bought or received sensitive information from American citizens.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant owns a house in Liberia. He built the house and lived in it prior to the civil war. At one point, Applicant estimated the value of the house at $70,000. 
With all the problems in Liberia, as discussed above, Applicant believes he would not be able to sell it for $1,000. Applicant does not have any other assets in 
Liberia.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Prior to the outbreak of civil war, Applicant's parents lived in a village. During the civil war, they moved and lived in the forest. Applicant did not hear from 
them for several years, and presumed them dead. In late 1996 or early 1997, Applicant received news that his parents had survived the civil war. Applicant 
traveled to Liberia in 1998 to visit his parents. This has been Applicant's only trip to Liberia since he left in about 1990. After the civil war resumed, 
Applicant's parents fled to Ghana as refugees. They returned to Liberia in 2004, after the cessation of hostilities. They now live in Applicant's house in Liberia. 
Applicant's parents are in their 80s. They are simple farmers, and like many of their countrymen, illiterate. They have no knowledge of what Applicant does for 
a living.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife and two of his children are naturalized U.S. citizens. Another child is a Liberian citizen, but a permanent U.S. resident, pending application for 
U.S. citizenship. Applicant's adopted daughter returned to Liberia some time in the 1990s. She is a Liberian citizen. She is married, and Applicant believes she 
is a teacher. Applicant's son is serving his second tour of duty in Iraq, as a member of the U.S. Army. He has been in the Army since 1994.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant speaks to his parents by telephone approximately two to four times per month. He speaks to his adopted daughter less often. He sends his parents 
around $1,500 every year. He does not send money to his adopted daughter. Applicant is firmly entrenched and invested in America. He has assets in the 
United States estimated at more than $1,000,000. He has no intention to move back to Liberia.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant presented himself as a sincere honest man at his hearing. His public trust position application shows no criminal involvement, financial, drug, or other 
concerns. He is well educated, with a stable employment record.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The revised Adjudicative Guidelines are used to make ADP trustworthiness determinations. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right 
to the procedures contained in the Directive before any determination may be made.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>An individual may not be assigned to perform sensitive duties unless a competent security authority determines it is clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to do so.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Positions designated as ADP I or ADP II are classified as sensitive positions.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> ADP III positions are "nonsensitive positions."<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
However, DOHA has been directed by a memorandum from the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) dated November 19, 
2004, to apply the due process provisions of the Directive for all trustworthiness determinations under ADP I, II, and including ADP III positions. Thus, even 
though ADP III positions are nonsensitive, they are treated in the same way and adjudicated under the same guidelines and procedures as ADP I and II cases.</P> 
 
<P>"The standard that must be met for &hellip; assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and

applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance

determination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each 
security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person 
concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">AG &para; 2(a)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions 
section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B, Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">F</SPAN>oreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to 
help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  
This raises a security concern under the foreign influence guideline.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign 
country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known 
to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country 
has interests inimical to those of the United States."<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations 
between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. 
Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an 
applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has 
an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence 
operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 7(a) (<EM>contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or 
other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country</EM> <EM>if that contact creates a heightened risk of</EM> <EM>foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, 
pressure, or coercion</EM>), and FI DC 7(e) (<EM>a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation</EM>). </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In determining the applicability of disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I specifically considered the nature of the government of Liberia, as discussed above, 
including human rights issues. There was one espionage case involving Liberia. Much of the danger and problems associated with Liberia is related to a high 
crime rate, not terrorism. I considered the circumstances of Applicant's family in Liberia. His parents are simple farmers with no idea about what Applicant 
does for a living. His adopted daughter is a teacher. I considered Applicant's demeanor and credibility, his character, ties to the U.S., his U.S. assets, and the 
impact of his son's service as a member of the U.S. Army. </SPAN>Because of Liberia's unstable status and one case of espionage, I find FI DC 7(a) to be minimally 
applicable. </P> 
 
<P>The value of Applicant's house in Liberia has plummeted to the point where he does not believe he could sell it for $1,000. When compared with his U.S. 
assets, I do not find this to be a substantial property interest in a foreign country. Furthermore, even if it arguably was a substantial property interest in a 
foreign country, based upon my consideration of all the evidence in this case, I find it<EM> </EM>could not subject Applicant to a heightened risk of foreign influence or 
exploitation. I do not find FI DC 7(e) to be applicable. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the</SPAN> Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and especially FI MC 8(a) (<EM>the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the 
country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely that the individual will be 
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign</EM></SPAN><EM> individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.</EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">). 
When determining the applicability of FI MC 8(a), I considered everything discussed above. Applicant is a stable U.S. citizen, with family in war-torn Liberia. 
While Liberia clearly still has many problems, I note that none of the government publications warned of danger from terrorism. Applicant's parents are elderly 
farmers. His adopted daughter is a school teacher. While there was one reported case of espionage involving Liberia, Liberia is in such poor shape, that as a 
state, it does not possess the level of knowledge and assets that some of the more aggressive states bring to bear in the espionage arena. Applicant's 
vulnerability is further reduced by his parent's lack of sophistication or knowledge of Applicant's job. It is extremely unlikely that Applicant will ever be placed 
in a position of having to choose between the interests of his parents and adopted daughter, or the government of Liberia, and the interests of the United 
States.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant is the father of a son serving in the U.S. Army in Iraq. I find it extremely unlikely that Applicant would do anything that could bring 
harm to his son. I conclude FI MC 8(a) </SPAN>is established.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Whole Person Analysis</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security 
risk. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. In 
evaluating Applicant's case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in AG &para; 2(a). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: TimesNewRoman">The listed factors are not the only ones that may be 
considered in performing a whole-person analysis in a Guideline B case. Other matters such as evidence of an applicant's personal attachments; the nature and 
extent of an applicant's family ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts 
of a given case can properly be factored into a judge's evaluation of an applicant's trustworthiness determination.<A HREF="05-08923.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have also considered every finding of fact 
and conclusion discussed above, including the facts for administrative notice. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nature of Liberia's government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the U.S. are all relevant factors in determining whether Liberia would risk 
damaging its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has strong ties to the U.S. He has a stable work history. The value of Applicant's house in Liberia is minuscule compared to his assets in the U.S.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
The property could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure him.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant is an intelligent mature man. He was sincere, open, and honest 
at the hearing. Most of his immediate family is in the U.S. I find very compelling that Applicant's son is in the U.S. Army, serving his second tour in Iraq. It is 
extremely unlikely Applicant would do anything to risk harm to his son. Considering all the evidence, I conclude Applicant has met his burden of demonstrating 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his </SPAN>eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.</P>
