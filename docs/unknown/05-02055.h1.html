<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On September 9, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating it was unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (financial considerations).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">November 8, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted 
the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 1,c, 1.d, and 1.e, under Guideline F. He failed to respond to allegation &para; 1.f. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
notice of hearing was issued on February 15, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 7, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government 
submitted five exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on 
his own behalf, and submitted five exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits A-E. The exhibits were admitted without objection. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 29 years old and has worked as a information technology customer service representative for a federal contractor since 2003. He served in the 
arine Corps from 1994 until February 2003, and was honorably discharged. He was married in 1997, and divorced in October 2002. He has a son from the 
marriage who is 6 years old and lives with his mother. When Applicant and his wife weredivorced he assumed responsibility for some of the delinquent debts. 
He also was required to pay $200 a month for 30 months in alimony, $500 a month in child support, and half of his son's medical and dental expenses.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Often 
he is not notified by his ex-wife when his son needs medical or dental care. When this happens he often receives bills that he was not aware of or that have 
become delinquent.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> It is difficult for himto budget for these expenses. He satisfied the alimony payments in May 2005, and he continues to pay child support. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant and his wife married he assumed her debts and he had two debts of his own.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> He obtained part-time jobs so he could pay off their debts and 
eventually did. During their marriage his wife took care of the finances. SOR allegation &para; 1.a was for a deferred payment plan through a military exchange 
facility. The original line of credit was for $500, and in 1998, he believed the account was almost paid off. He later learned that his wife, without telling him, 
had the credit limit increased to $1,100 and she had maximized the amount.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He tried to set up a plan to pay $25 a month, but the creditor refused to accept the 
nominal amount. He wants to be able to pay an amount that he can afford, but is uncertain if the creditor will accept it. He has not paid the debt and has not 
taken any other action to resolve it.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR allegations &para;&para; 1.b and 1.d are for the same credit card debt. Applicant acquired this credit card in 2000, while he was married and was he responsible for 
its payment upon his divorce. At the time of his divorce he did not have sufficient funds to make payments on the debt. He started making payments in October 
2005 and has made four monthly payments of $50.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR allegation &para;1.c is a debt for a computer Applicant and his wife purchased in 1999, while married. The original cost was approximately $1,300 and they 
paid approximately $75 a month. Between 1998 to 2000, he and his wife had several separation periods when they were not living together. She took the 
computer with her and he did not receive the bill. He mistakenly believed she was staying current on the payments. Their payments became delinquent. In 2005, 
he made three payments of $200 on the debt that had grown to over $4,000. He has not made any other payments on this debt.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife purchased carpet for their house and owed approximately $1,828, SOR &para; 1.e. They made payments of $55 a month for an undetermined 
time, but the debt eventually became delinquent.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant attempted to contact the creditor, but they had gone out of business and he was unable to do so.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> 
He has not received any correspondence from the company. He was provided a copy of a credit report that provided contact information, but he was unaware 
the information was on the report and has not made any subsequent attempts to contact the creditor. He admits he still owes the debt.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After Applicant was discharged from the Marine Corps he was significantly underemployed, recently divorced and responsible for considerable delinquent debt. 
He admitted all of the delinquent debts were under his name, despite acquiring most while he was married.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He saved money by living in a friend's garage for 
ten months. After meeting his monthly expenses and making a monthly payment on one of his debts he has approximately $70 remaining each month, after 
paying his expenses. He has worked part-time jobs in the past and plans on getting a part-time job to satisfy his delinquent debts. He works full time, attends 
college and is taking ten credit hours this semester. He recently purchased a house with his fiancee and claims his portion of the mortgage payment is a little 
more than what he had been paying for rent.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Applicant is a devoted father who is attempting to obtain custody of his son. He has other debts related to his son 
and anticipates he will have some major dental expenses for him.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> These debts and expenses are not listed in the SOR and are not considered for disqualifying 
purposes, but are considered with regard to his ability to meet all of his financial obligations. He has not sought any recent financial counseling and admits he is 
"climbing out of the hole," in reference to his finances.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="05-02055.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F- Financial Considerations-a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible 
may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of 
life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations),</EM> and FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3<EM> (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>),<EM> </EM>apply in this case. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debts. He did not take any action on 
the debts until his security clearance application became an obvious issue. Based on Applicant's income and expenses he does not have the financial means to 
meet all of his obligations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and especially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not 
recent), </EM>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>It was an isolated incident), </EM>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),</EM> and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).</EM> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has four delinquent debts that he has not paid in full. The debts are recent because they have not been fully paid. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 does not apply. 
The number of debts negates the application of FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. When Applicant left the Marine Corps he was significantly underemployed and recently 
divorced. He was required to pay marital debts that were beyond his means and provide alimony for a period of 30 months and child support. Applicant was 
also responsible for half of the medical and dental bills incurred by this son. He would often not find out about the bills from his ex-wife until they were 
delinquent, causing financial turmoil. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 applies. Applicant has slowly been moving his life forward and taking responsibility for his debts. 
He has worked in the past at part-time jobs and credibly testified he plans on getting one in the future to pay off the remainder of his debts. Although Applicant 
is committed to paying them all off he has not made any payments on the debts listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.e. He only recently started a payment plan on SOR &para;&para; 
1. b and 1.d, which are the same debt. He made four payments on his consumer debt in SOR &para; 1.c, but has not resumed paying off the debt. At this juncture, 
Applicant has more expenses and debts than his monthly income can accommodate. It has been three years since his divorce and discharge, and it was not until 
recently that he started to focus on his delinquencies. Despite his commitment to resolving his debts, he needs more time to show a consistent payment history 
on those he is paying and a valid payment plan on the others. I find FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 does not apply. Therefore, I find he has failed to mitigate the security 
concerns under Guideline F regarding financial considerations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I considered the whole person and I find Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding Guideline F. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of 
the evidence in this case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time. Accordingly, Guideline F is 
decided against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
