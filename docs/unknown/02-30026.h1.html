<P>Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concern of foreign influence raised by her connections to Taiwan. Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security 
concern under Guideline B for foreign influence due to Applicant's connections to Taiwan (Republic of China). Applicant answered the SOR on March 11, 
2004, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>Department Counsel indicated they were ready to proceed on June 21, 2004, and the case was assigned to me June 28, 2004. On July 13, 2004, a notice of 
hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for August 10, 2004. Applicant appeared without counsel, the hearing took place as scheduled, and I received the 
transcript on August 24, 2004. Issuing a decision was delayed due to a heavy caseload.</P> 
<P><CENTER>     <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a - 1.f, and she provided a full explanation. Her admissions are incorporated into my 
findings. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old married woman who was born in Taiwan in 1957. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1992. She is employed as a senior 
professional staff member for a not-for-profit research and development organization that is part of a major university. She is seeking to obtain a security 
clearance in conjunction with her employment. Applicant's professional duties consist primarily of software engineering wherein she works in the development 
and application of software to understand and interpret space physics data.</P> 
<P>Applicant was raised and educated in Taiwan until 1983 when she entered the U.S. on a student visa to pursue a graduate degree at a state university. She 
earned a master's degree in physics. In 1991, she earned a second master's degree in electrical engineering from a different university. </P> 
<P>In 1984, while a graduate student, Applicant met and married her husband who is also a native-born citizen of Taiwan. He obtained U.S. citizenship in 1992, 
the same year as Applicant. They have one child, a son, who  is a native-born U.S. citizen and is now a college student at a prestigious U.S. university. 
Applicant's husband is employed as a scientist working in the field of molecular biology. </P> 
<P>Applicant has family members who are citizens of and residents in Taiwan. Her mother passed away sometime in the 1970s when Applicant was a high-school 
student. As a result, Applicant's father left military service to care for Applicant and her two siblings. Applicant's father has had no affiliation with the 
Taiwanese military since leaving, nor has he been employed in other jobs. Her father is now 77 years old and lives with Applicant's brother. Her father is blind 
in one eye and has poor vision in the other. As a result, he is very isolated and essentially housebound. Applicant is quite close to her father--she has an 
enormous amount of respect for him--and, since international telephone rates have decreased in price, she calls him frequently, sometimes on a daily basis, to 
check on him. The calls are relatively brief, five to ten minutes, and consist primarily of Applicant asking her father how he is feeling and inquiring about any 
other family business. Applicant describes her father as an ordinary person who has not been involved with political or criminal activity.</P> 
<P>Applicant has two siblings. Her brother is 50 years old, divorced, and the father of two children. He is employed at a county tax office. Applicant's sister is 43 
years old and is a stay-at-home mom. She is married and has three children. As far as Applicant knows, her sister's husband is self-employed and runs a small 
family-owned convenience store. Applicant maintains occasional contact with her siblings, and their telephone conversations center on family business. 
Applicant describes both her brother and sister as quiet, modest, well behaved, and respectful people. </P> 
<P>Based on her marriage, Applicant has in-laws who are citizens of and residents in Taiwan. She has only met them a few times since her marriage in 1984. The 
meetings took place during family gatherings. Given the limited contact, along with a language barrier (Applicant speaks Mandarin Chinese and they speak 
Taiwanese), Applicant does not have a close relationship with her parents-in-law. Applicant believes they are approximately 82 and 78 years old, retired, and 
her father-in-law has been in poor health for some time. Applicant describes them as quiet, reserved, and ordinary people. </P> 
<P>Applicant's husband has four siblings who are citizens of and residents in Taiwan. Like her parents-in-laws, Applicant is not close to these extended family 
members. She has met them only a few times since her marriage. Applicant believes her husband's two older sisters are both stay-at-home moms. Applicant 
also believes her husband's brother and younger sister work for commercial companies.</P> 
<P>Applicant has a childhood friend who is a citizen of and a resident in Taiwan. The friend is a stay-at-home mother and wife who is married to a doctor and has 
two college-aged children. Applicant describes her contact with her friend as infrequent and centers on their respective families. </P> 
<P>Applicant traveled to Taiwan in 1997, 2000, and 2001 to visit her family. Applicant fully disclosed these trips on her security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). 
She used her U.S. passport for these trips, and she experienced no difficulties or problems with Taiwanese officials during any of the trips. In addition, 
Applicant has no financial interests, business connections, or real estate holdings in Taiwan. </P> 
<P>Administrative notice was taken of certain facts concerning Taiwan as specified by Department Counsel in Exhibits 3 and 4 as follows: (1) Taiwan is one of the 
most active collectors of economic espionage; and (2) Taiwan is one of several countries that have significant intelligence operations targeting the U.S. </P> 
<P>Applicant called two character witnesses who vouched for her security suitability. The first was a retired federal employee who worked for a governmental 
space agency for 40 years as an engineer and project scientist. He supervised Applicant for approximately ten years, and he describes Applicant as completely 
honest, ethical, trustworthy, reliable, responsible, and loyal. He believes Applicant makes good decisions, is highly motivated and technically competent, has an 
outstanding reputation, and is an extremely valuable asset to this country. The second was Applicant's past and current supervisor who has known Applicant for 
about ten years. He has no doubts about Applicant's character and believes she is a completely trustworthy employee.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN></STRONG>   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in 
other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. Common 
sense suggests that t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close 
associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline B. The concern here is Applicant's immediate family 
members in Taiwan. DC 1<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> applies because Applicant has immediate family members (her father and two siblings) who are citizens of and residents in Taiwan. 
She is close to her father, brother, and sister, as evidenced by her trips to visit them as well as her regular telephone calls. Also, DC 1 applies because of 
Applicant's  relationship with her childhood friend. I am not persuaded, however, that DC 1 applies to Applicant's parents-in-law and extended family 
members. Applicant has rebutted the presumption that she has close ties of affection or obligation to her husband's family members in Taiwan given the 
particular circumstances here (met a few times and language barrier). Accordingly, SOR subparagraphs 1.c and 1.e are concluded for Applicant. The remaining 
DC do not apply given the record evidence. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline B and conclude that MC 1<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies. The record evidence shows Applicant's immediate family 
members are not agents of the Taiwanese government.<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Her immediate family members have rather ordinary lives (her father has been retired since the 1970s, 
her brother is a white-collar worker for a county tax office, and her sister is a housewife) that make it most unlikely they would have an undue interest in 
Applicant's work or that they would come to the attention of Taiwanese authorities. Given these circumstances, her immediate family members are not in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power. Second, MC 3<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> applies to Applicant's relationship with her childhood friend. Her friend is a housewife and their 
conversations are about their families. Although Applicant maintains an emotional connection to her friend, the contact between the two is both infrequent and 
casual. Third, MC 5<A HREF="02-30026.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> applies because Applicant's financial interests are all located in the U.S. and she has no financial interests in Taiwan or any other foreign 
country. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also receives credit in mitigation for reasons not specified in the formal mitigating conditions. Here, we have a woman who has lived in the U.S. 
since 1983, and has been a law-abiding U.S. citizen since 1992. She has earned two master's degrees in the U.S., and she has worked in her field of expertise in 
the U.S. She is a respected member of her employer's professional staff and she is described as a trustworthy, honest, and reliable person. Her husband is a 
naturalized U.S. citizen and her son is a native-born U.S. citizen. It's plain her family and professional lives are firmly rooted in the U.S. Cumulatively, these 
matters further mitigate the foreign influence security concern. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has met her </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against her and her 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching my decision, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, the whole-person 
concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
