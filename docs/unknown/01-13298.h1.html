<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor, applied for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), the federal agency 
tasked with determining an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information, declined to grant Applicant a clearance.  In accordance with the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="01-13298.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="01-13298.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 19 July 2002 detailing why a clearance was not 
granted and recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the SOR, 
DOHA alleged Applicant failed to meet the security violations (Guideline K) and personal conduct (Guideline E) personnel security guidelines of the Directive. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 26 November 2002.  The case was assigned to me on 7 January 2003.  On 29 April 2003, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of six exhibits.  
Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one other witness, and submitted five exhibits.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 7 May 
2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant, a 64-year-old international marketing manager for a defense contractor, held a security clearance for many years.  In 1999, Applicant's company 
received a request for proposal (RFP) from a foreign government.  The company responded in October 1999 with information that improperly commingled 
algorithms that were in the public domain and those that were controlled by the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Ex. 6 at 1; Ex. E at 1.  
During the internal company discussions concerning the RFP, an issue arose as to whether information in one of the charts was controlled by ITAR.  Ex. 1 at 2-3.</P> 
 
<P>[Company] engineers prepared the technical date in the report and as the lead marketing person . . . I along with our technical personnel, reviewed the proposal 
for any classified information. [Company] personnel and I discussed a chart containing data that was in the proposal. We felt the chart and data was not 
International Traffic and Arms Regulation controlled if we kept the data in the report.  I had final responsibility to approve or disapprove the report, I decided to 
submit it containing the chart.  The report was later reviewed by [the Company] facilities security officer (FSO).  She felt that the chart should not have been in 
the report.</P> 
 
<P>Ex. 1 at 2-3.  Applicant apparently failed to get the export administrator (the facilities security officer) to clear the report before transmitting it to the 
representatives of the foreign government.  The company reported an ITAR violation to the U.S. Department of State.  The State Department concluded that "a 
serious infraction had occurred," but determined that the measures taken by the company were sufficient to avoid further sanction.  Ex. E at C.<A HREF="01-13298.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In approximately October 2000, Applicant was asked to work on a company project with a short suspense.  Tr. 44.  He was told that information he would need 
for the project was on a CD and could be obtained from a co-worker.  He obtained the CD, but was unaware there was any classified material on it because it 
did not contain any security markings.  Tr. 53.  He took it home to work on over the weekend.  Ex. 1 at 1.  On Saturday, he inserted the CD into his computer 
and printed out several of the documents contained on it.  <EM>Id</EM>.; Tr. 81.  Some of the pages contained NATO Confidential or NATO Restricted markings.  Ex. 1 at 
1; Ex. C.  Realizing that he should not have classified materials in his home, Applicant locked the CD and printed materials in a file cabinet in his home office 
for the rest of the weekend.  Tr. 56.  On Monday, Applicant took the printed materials, but not the CD to work.  He locked the printed materials in a container 
authorized to secure classified information, and told the project manager that some of the material on the CD was classified.  Tr. 55-57.  The project manager 
told Applicant that he had received the CD through the mail, he had made arrangement to get a document brought in through proper channels, the project was 
time critical, and Applicant should keep working with it.  Tr. 55.  Applicant did so.  Tr. 59.  </P> 
 
<P>Several days later, the company security officer entered Applicant's office, saw what he was working on and asked him about it.  Ex. 5 at 4-5.  Applicant told 
her about the CD, explained how he was securing it in his home, and showed her the pages he had printed from the CD.  Tr. 60.  The security officer told 
Applicant to bring the CD in.  Applicant retrieved the CD from his house and turned it over to the security officer.  Tr. 61.  The CD was still devoid of any 
security markings.  Ex. C.  Applicant was provided with some security software to clean his computer.  He did so, but a few days later the security officer had 
him take the computer to work so it could be checked by experts.  Tr. 62.  The machine was clear.  Tr. 63.  Applicant cooperated fully with the investigation 
that ensued and accepted full responsibility for his actions.  Ex. C.  The security officer reported the incident to the Defense Security Service as required.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a key member of the defense contractor's management team.  The chief executive officer and founder of the company believes Applicant has 
learned his lesson and there will not be a repeat incident.  He believes Applicant does not represent a security risk.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus 
or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations 
should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline K-Security Violations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, &para; 1.a., DOHA alleged under Guideline K that Applicant knowingly and willfully failed to follow security requirements concerning the use and 
distribution of NATO Confidential information in that he (1) circumventing security regulations by retaining the material at his private residence without 
approval; (2) failing to physically mark the CD containing the material with appropriate security markings; and (3) storing the materials in a container not 
approved for retention of such classified information.  Under Guideline K, the noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's 
trustworthiness and his willingness and ability to safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A11.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knew that all classified information must be appropriately marked,<A HREF="01-13298.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> secured in a GSA-approved security container,<A HREF="01-13298.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and appropriately protected 
from inappropriate disclosure.  Applicant's noncompliance with security regulations was deliberate.  DC 2.  He clearly understood that his retaining the 
classified materials at his home was unauthorized, that he was storing them in an unauthorized container, and that he should have marked the CD with the 
appropriate security markings.  At the hearing, Applicant admitted his derelictions and demonstrated a positive attitude towards the discharge of his security 
responsibilities.  MC 4.  He appeared to be remorseful and contrite.  However, the weight of such mitigating evidence is tempered by his failure, only a year 
earlier, to ensure compliance with ITAR on a different project.  While the information released on that occasion was not classified, and the release was 
inadvertent, Applicant was in large part responsible for the violation.  Corrective action was taken to make sure future violations would not occur.  Apparently 
Applicant did not learn much from that exercise.  Applicant should have been especially sensitive to the need to follow the rules and procedures for protecting 
classified and sensitive information.  Instead, Applicant failed to take the steps required to secure the classified information.  The finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant knowingly and willfully failed to follow security requirements for NATO Confidential 
information as detailed in SOR &para; 1.a. (SOR &para; 2.a.) and knowingly and willfully conspired with another to not notify appropriate security officials of the 
improper receipt of classified information (SOR &para; 2.b.).  Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  
Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's willful refusal to follow the correct procedures in handling and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">labeling classified information, and his agreement with another employee to 
continue to violate the security rules,  demonstrates his questionable judgment and unreliability.  This personal conduct increases his vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation or duress.  DC 4.  It also shows, in conjunction with his failure to handle ITAR materials properly, a pattern of rules violations.  DC 5.  Applicant 
took positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate the vulnerability (MC 5) by causing these materials to be secured only after being confronted by the 
security officer.  The finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
