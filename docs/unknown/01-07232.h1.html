<P>The Applicant has dual US-Iranian citizenship.  He was born in Iran and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1994.  He has a current Iranian passport.  Because 
the Applicant holds a foreign passport, clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 21, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1) to Applicant, stating that DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-07232.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 
October 26, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR (Item 3) and elected to have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 16, 2001, the Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) dated November 9, 2001, and was given the 
opportunity to file objections and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation.  The Applicant's response to the FORM was due on December 16, 
2001.  No response was received.  I was assigned the case on January 7, 2002, at which time the record in the case closed.  The Department Counsel presented 
five exhibits (Items). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges foreign preference (Guideline C). The Applicant admits the allegations except for SOR subparagraph 1.c., which alleged the Applicant 
possessed an expired passport.  The Applicant had renewed his foreign passport prior to answering the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 42 years old, has worked for a federal contractor since October 1990, and seeks a security clearance.  He was born in Iran and, came to the 
U.S. in 1978 on a student visa.  In 1982, the Applicant applied for political asylum.  Although initially denied, asylum was granted.  In 1984, he received his 
B.S. degree from an American U.S. university.  Both of his parents were born in Iran and currently live with him in the U.S.  His brother also lives in the U.S. 
and his sister lives in England.  In November 1994, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Since that time he has maintained dual citizenship.  He has no 
business interest, property holdings, bank accounts, or close relatives or relationships in Iran. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASDC3I) issued guidance clarifying the 
application of the Foreign Preference adjudicative guideline, hereinafter "ASDC3I memo."  In September 2001, a copy of the ASDC3I memo accompanied the 
SOR. (Item 2, page 3, Enclosures).  The Applicant has taken no steps to relinquish his Iranian passport.  The Applicant renewed his Iranian passport in 1992 
and again at some time between December 2000--when he made a sworn statement (Item 5) and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October 26, 2001-- when he answered the SOR.  He 
maintains the foreign passport to allow </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">easier travel should he travel to Iran in the future. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2001, the Applicant stated, " . . . I would not want to give up my Iranian citizenship status, or my Iranian passport for the purpose of obtaining this 
security clearance."  (Item 5, page 2)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Preference (Guideline C)</STRONG>  The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 
States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: E2.A3.1.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   2.  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  E2.A3.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  E2.A3.1.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None Apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, 
mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge 
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline C, (Foreign Preference).  Under Guideline C, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when the person holds a foreign passport.  Some time between December 2000 and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October 26, 2001, the Applicant renewed his Iranian 
passport.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no evidence the Applicant's possession of the foreign passport was officially approved by the U.S. government. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence issued guidance clarifying the application of 
the Foreign Preference adjudicative guideline.  The ASDC3I memo states any clearance must be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign 
passport or obtains approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States government.  Although aware of the memo, the Applicant has not 
surrendered the foreign passport nor received approval from the U.S. government.  Application of the ASDC3I memo is dispositive on the issue of Applicant's 
possession of a foreign passport.  I find against the Applicant as to Foreign Preference (Guideline C) SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
