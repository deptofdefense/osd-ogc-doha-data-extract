<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 22, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>,<EM> </EM>dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR states that DOHA was 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to any classified information and recommends that his case be submitted 
to an Administrative Judge.  On September 10, 2002, the  Applicant provided a response to the SOR, admitting all allegations and requested a hearing.  This 
case was assigned to the undersigned Administrative Judge on November 22, 2002.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 2, 2002, and the hearing was 
held on December 23, 2002.  During the hearing, two Government exhibits, eleven Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of the two Applicant witnesses, 
including the Applicant, were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 2, 2003.</P>

<P>The PRC is a totalitarian communist regime who's interests are inimical to those of the United States.  For decades, the PRC has conducted extensive political, 
military, and economic espionage against the United States.<A HREF="02-06478.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Chinese-Americans are particular targets of the PRC's espionage against the United States.<A HREF="02-06478.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  
Americans who visit the PRC and stay with friends or relatives, must register with local police.<A HREF="02-06478.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon an individual meeting adjudicative guidelines discussed in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  An 
evaluation of whether an applicant meets these guidelines includes the consideration of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept."  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a decision. This assessment should include 
the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 provides conditions for each guideline that could raise a concern and may be disqualifying , as well as further conditions that could mitigate a 
concern and support granting a clearance.  The following guidelines are applicable to this case.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline B - Foreign Influence: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she 
may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential 
for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other 
countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could  raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, 
a foreign country (Disqualifying Condition 1).</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.6.  Conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government.  (Disqualifying Condition 6).</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters) cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to the person(s) involved and the United States (Mitigating Condition 1).</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Guideline B - Foreign Influence </P> 
 
<P>Undisputed evidence in this case presents two disqualifying conditions pertaining to the Applicant.  Disqualifying Condition 1 applies because Applicant's 
parents, with whom he maintains a close relationship, are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Disqualifying Condition 6 also applies.  Given conditions in the 
PRC, Applicant's travels there, including four trips between 1994 and 1999, may make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by the PRC.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has offered evidence in an effort to mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  To establish Mitigating Condition 1, he has presented evidence that his 
parents are not agents of the PRC and he argues that the evidence shows that they are not in a position to be exploited by the PRC.  The evidence to which 
Applicant refers is that Applicant's parents are both retired and receiving retirement benefits.  However, I fail to see how this evidence demonstrates that 
Applicant's parents are not in a position to be exploited.  To the contrary, the fact that they are reliant upon retirement income and medical benefits in the PRC 
would appear to make them vulnerable to exploitation by the PRC.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has also attempted to demonstrate that the nature of his visits to his parents does not make him subject to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by the 
PRC.<A HREF="02-06478.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  He emphasizes that he does not contact anyone other than his parents and family on these visits.   Although Applicant may attempt to keep a low-profile during his return visits to China, he has not mitigated the fact they expose him to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by the PRC.  Although he describes 
it as being like a home association, Applicant acknowledges that he has had to register with the local security office where his parents reside during these visits.  
This confirms other evidence of record that foreign visitors who stay with friends or family in the PRC must register with the local police.  Given such 
monitoring in the PRC and the nature of its espionage aimed at Chinese-Americans, Applicant has failed to demonstrate that even his low-profile visits do not 
make him vulnerable to possible coercion, exploitation or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues the applicability of the decisions of administrative judges in ISCR Case No. 01-23911 (Apr. 30, 2002) and ISCR Case No. 01-26031 (May 30, 
2002).  Another administrative judge's decision is not binding but may be considered as persuasive authority.  ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 
2002).  However, the cases cited by Applicant are clearly distinguishable from the facts of his case.  ISCR Case No. 01-23911 involves a natural born U.S. 
citizen who subsequently became a dual citizen of New Zealand, a country which does not present the threat to the national security of the United States that 
does the PRC.  In ISCR Case No. 01-26031, the applicant's father had left the PRC and had become a permanent resident of the United States and her sister had 
become a permanent resident of Germany.  Although applicant's mother was still residing in China, arrangements had been made for her to obtain a visa and 
immigrate to the United States to live with the applicant.  Therefore, the facts are significantly distinguishable from this case, since Applicant's parents reside in 
the PRC and there is no evidence that they are about to emigrate.</P> 
 
<P>Family ties in a foreign country raises a prima facie security concern that requires the applicant "to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation 
sufficient to meet the burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him."  ISCR Case 
No. 99-0532 at 6 (App. Bd. Feb. 27, 2001).  This is especially critical given the espionage effort against the United States in which the PRC is engaged and the 
threat to the national interest of the United States that it represents.  Clearly, Applicant has failed to meet his burden of persuasion in this case.</P> 
 
<P>The DOHA Appeal Board has recognized that "an applicant with good character and personal integrity can pose a security risk because the applicant has close 
relatives in a country hostile to the United States."  ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 8.  This decision should not be interpreted in any sense to impugn the character 
or loyalty of the Applicant.  In fact, the evidence in this case reveals that he is a man of good character and personal integrity.  It is also apparent that 
Applicant's achievements are attributable to his intelligence, hard work and dedication.  Consistent with Executive Order 10865, as set forth in Enclosure 1 of 
the Directive, the loyalty and respect for this country that Applicant professes should not be questioned.<A HREF="02-06478.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal findings, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:</P>

no applicability because, as Applicant acknowledges, there is no evidence that Applicant has ever been contacted by the PRC or any other country.  Mitigating 
Condition 5 is irrelevant because the Government is not alleging, and there is no evidence, Applicant has a substantial financial interest in the PRC or any in
