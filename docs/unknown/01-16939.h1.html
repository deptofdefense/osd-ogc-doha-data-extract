<P>Applicant was convicted by special court martial of being absent without leave, forgery, obtaining services under false pretenses, and attempting to obtain 
services. As a result of this conduct, he received a sentence of reduction to Airman Basic, forfeited $1,500.00, was sentenced to three months confinement, and 
ultimately received a General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions). He was reprimanded for Violation of Article 134 of the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice (UCMJ), because he wrote checks with Insufficient Funds on three separate occasions.  Finally, on a 1999 Security Clearance Application (SCA) 
Applicant failed to disclose that he served in the United States Air Force and that he received a General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions).  Mitigation 
has not been shown. Clearance is denied.      </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On June 3, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In two signed and sworn statements, dated August 26, 2002, and October 15, 2002, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On June 10, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case, which was prepared on 
April 7, 2003. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to the Applicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant had until June 1, 2003, to file a response to the FORM, but no response was received. The 
case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 10, 2003.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered 18 documentary exhibits. (Exhibits 1 - 18)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. Additionally, in the FORM, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> requested that 
allegation 1.a. of the SOR be amended to comport with the evidence submitted in the FORM.. Specifically, the request is that 1.a. be changed from its current 
language to read: "On or about September 27, 1985, you were convicted by special court martial of being absent without leave, forgery, obtaining services 
under false pretenses, and attempting to obtain services. You were sentenced to reduction in rate, forfeiture of $1,5000.00 in pay and 3 month confinement. You 
were subsequently separated under the provision of AFR 39-10, receiving a General Discharge."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The wording in the last two sentences of this requested amended SOR allegation has not been changed. The only change requested is the date of the court 
martial and the specific allegations for which the court martial was issued. Applicant had notice of this proposed amendment and did not object. Paragraph 1.a. 
of the SOR is amended to reflect the wording stated above. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of 
the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The SOR contains four allegations; two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b., under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline J</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Guideline E</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.  In his 
response to the SOR, Applicant admits all four allegations. Since Applicant has not responded to the amended 1.a., I will not consider 1.a. to be admitted. 
Allegations 1.b., 2.a., and 2.b. are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration

pretenses, and attempting to obtain services. (Exhibit 18). As a result of this conduct, Applicant received a sentence of reduction to Airman Basic, he forfeited 
$1,500.00, and he was sentenced to three months confinement. Ultimately, he received a General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions) (Exhibit 11, Exhibit

overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the

conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to guidelines J and E:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's conduct that is the basis for allegation of 1.a. of the SOR is criminal and did result in 
his court martial and general discharge from the Air Force. Additionally, while it was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant's false statements on the SCA are a 
violation of section 1001 of Title 18 of the United States Code. I resolve Guideline J against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline J,  I conclude that Disqualifying Condition (DC) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.2.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> and DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.2.2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> apply because Applicant's conduct did involve a number 
of criminal offense. No Mitigating Conditions (MC)s apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally provided false material information to the Government in response to two 
questions on the SCA that he executed in August  1999. Applicant certainly knew that he had served in the United States Air Force from1978 through 
December 1985. There can be no reasonable explanation for Applicant failing to include this information on his SCA.  Applicant also knew that he did not 
receive an Honorable </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Discharge, but rather a General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions). In this case, Applicant's falsifications of his SCA were knowingly and willingly 
committed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and honesty necessary for an 
individual given a clearance .  I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC E2.A5.1.2.2. applies because of the false information that Applicant provided in his SCA. DC 
E2.A5.1.2.5 also applies because Applicant's conduct, which resulted in his court martial, shows a pattern of dishonesty. No MCs apply.</SPAN></P>
