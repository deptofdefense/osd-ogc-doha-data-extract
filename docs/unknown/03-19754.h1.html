<P>Applicant failed to mitigate financial concerns arising from delinquent debts in excess of $13,000.00 arising while he was in the Air Force between 1997 and 
2001. He was in a debt consolidation program in 2002 but withdrew from it when creditors expressed dissatisfaction. He recently filed for Chapter 7 
bankruptcy. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On January 25, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on June 20, 2005. A notice of 
hearing was issued on August 10, 2005, for a hearing on August 30, 2005, and held that day. The government offered nine exhibits in evidence and all were 
accepted. Applicant offered none. The record was left open until September 16, 2005, for submission of evidence but none was received. The transcript was 
received on August 30, 2005.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all twelve of the SOR allegations. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor working in computer maintenance for air defense, a skill he learned while on active duty with the 
Air Force between 1997 and 2001. He incurred several debts cited in the SOR totaling a little over $13,000.00. Most of the debts were incurred while on active 
duty when he was providing support for two brothers and a girlfriend. Applicant has not made payment on these debts and did not have adequate records for  
them as they had been sold several times to collection agencies. </P> 
<P>Applicant was in credit counseling in 2002 and had consolidated his debts. He withdrew from the program when, after making several payments, he received 
letters from some of the creditors stating that their share of the payments were insufficient to resolve their claims.  He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May, 
2005, and an initial hearing was held June 23, 2005, in bankruptcy court. He is awaiting further information and a ruling from the court. </P> 
<P>His largest delinquent debt for $5,075.00 is for an auto repossession that has not been paid. He had purchased an expensive foreign car on which he could not 
make payments. The second largest debt is for medical expenses while he was in the Air Force in the amount of $2,998.00 that he believes should have been 
paid by Tricare. The other eleven debts are for lesser amounts and include credit cards, telephone charges, and claims by a landlord. He had intended to pay 
them but no payments were made. </P> 
<P>Applicant was recently married and has one small child and a second is expected. His annual salary is $52,000.00.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concerns under Guideline F in that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not 
meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.), and evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions (MC) might 
include the fact that the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (E2.A6.1.3.3.), or the person has initiated a good faith 
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.). Although he incurred some of debts because he was helping family members, there is no showing that the matter was beyond his 
control. He abandoned his debt consolidation program without any apparent effort to modify it or work out other consolidation procedures. No mitigating 
conditions are applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has undertaken bankruptcy in an 
effort to write a clean slate but too late to overcome the fact that the debts were delinquent, and that he failed to work any of them out over the past years since 
they became delinquent.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that a security clearance 
should not be granted. Clearance is denied. </SPAN></P>
