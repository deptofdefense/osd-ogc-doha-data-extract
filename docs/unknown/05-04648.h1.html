<P>Applicant, an Iranian born, United States citizen, has lived in the United States since 1978. He has renounced his Iranian citizenship and returned his Iranian passport to the Iranian Government. 
Because of Applicant's powerful attachment to his wife, son, and brother in the United States, neither Applicant's sister, who is a  resident and citizen of Iran, nor his father-in-law and mother-in-law, who are citizens and residents of Bolivia, are in a position to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United 
States.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted. <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">November</SPAN> 25, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral 
to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied. The SOR was based on Foreign Preference (Guideline C) and Foreign Influence 
(Guideline B) concerns.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, filed a notarized response, dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 26</SPAN>, 2005, to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On January 30, 
2006, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge  to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal notice, dated February 16, 2006, a hearing was initially scheduled for March 14, 2006. Because of 
a request by <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN>, the case was rescheduled, and it was held on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 18</SPAN>, 2006.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered 12 documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 12) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 21 documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - U) and offered his 
own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">April 27</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline C (</SPAN>Foreign Preference<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) and Guideline B (</SPAN>Foreign Influence<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of the Directive. The SOR contained 
one allegation, 1.a., under Guideline C, and four allegations, 2.a. through 2.d., under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. All of the admissions are incorporated herein as 
Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional 
Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 46 years old and is employed as a Software Engineer by a United States defense contractor, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">which seeks a security clearance on his behalf.</SPAN> He received a Master of Science Degree in 
Electrical Engineering in 1993 from a United States university.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Iran in 1959, and in 1978, at the age of 18 he moved to the United States, where he has lived since that time. He became a United States citizen in 1990.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United States. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the years 1991, 1993, and 1994, Applicant traveled to Turkey to visit his family, who came from Iran, where they resided.  On all of these trips he used his </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> passport. In 1997, 
Applicant's mother became ill and was not physically able to leave Iran. After requesting and receiving approval from the </SPAN>United States<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> State Department, Applicant applied for and received an 
Iranian passport, which he was informed was necessary for him to visit his mother in Iran.  In 1998, Applicant visited his mother for two weeks in Iran.  In 2000, he went back to Iran to attend his 
mother's funeral. On both of these trips he used his Iranian passport. These two trips were the only time Applicant used his Iranian passport. Applicant has not returned to Iran nor used his Iranian 
passport since 2000, not even in 2004 when his father died. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 31, 2006, Applicant sent to the Embassy of Pakistan, Interests Section of the Republic of Iran Office, a registered letter in which he renounced his Iranian citizenship and returned his 
Iranian <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">passport</SPAN>. The Director of this Iranian office wrote a letter on February 7, 2006, indicating that the letter of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> with his <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">passport</SPAN> had been received (Exhibits C, D, E).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who 
are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to duress.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a sister who is a  resident and citizen of Iran. She is a housewife, and her husband is an anesthesiologist. Neither his sister, nor her spouse, belongs to, or is active with any national 
government agency of Iran. Applicant speaks to his sister two or three times a year. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> described his relationship with his sister as distant (Tr at 46-49, 70).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> brother also was born in Iran, and he came to the United States in 1994. He has resided here since that time.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> brother works full time and is attending law school on a part 
time basis. He is still an Iranian citizen, but he has no desire to return to Iran.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> wife was born in Bolivia and came to the United States in 2000. She is currently a permanent resident of the United States, and when she becomes eligible she will apply to be a United 
States citizen. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> and his wife got married in 2003, and their son is less than a year old and a natural-born United States citizen. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> father-in-law and mother-in-law are residents and citizens of Bolivia. The father-in-law is a retired mechanic and the mother-in-law is a housewife. They only speak Spanish and since 
<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN> knowledge of Spanish is limited they do not have much communication. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> purchased a home in the United States in 2005 for $585,000. He also owns another United States home that has been valued at $305,000. He has other assets estimated to be worth 
$400,000. He has no assets outside of the United States, nor he will not be inheriting anything out of the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant introduced six positive letters of reference that spoke of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> as trustworthy and conscientious (Exhibit P). A friend and former co-worker said <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> is, "an intelligent and 
honest person with high integrity."She also said he is "a hard-working, respectable and trustworthy individual." He also introduced his latest Performance Evaluation which rated his overall 
assessment as "Exceeded Expectations." </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account in 
reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent 
criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. </P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of 
the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the 
circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </P> 
 
<P>Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every 
case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is 
clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and 
conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of 
witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified 
information.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a security 
concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.   </P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government raise 
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United 
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side 
of denials." Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, 
Section E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with respect to 
Guidelines C and B:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States. Applicant's use of a Iranian passport after becoming a United Stated 
citizen raises serious Foreign Preference (Guideline C) concerns. At the time the SOR was issued, Disqualifying Condition DC (E2.A3.1.2.1.), the exercise of dual citizenship could be argued to 
apply because he renewed his Iranian passport, and DC (E2.A3.1.2.2.), possession and/or use of a foreign passport, applied. However, Applicant renewed his passport and used it on two occasions, 
to visit his mother when she became ill and to attend her funeral. He has subsequently returned his Iranian passport and formally renounced his Iranian citizenship. Mitigating Condition (MC) 
(E2.A3.1.3.4.), an individual has expressed a willingness to renounce his dual citizenship, is applicable, as Applicant has renounced his Iranian citizenship. Guideline C is found for <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>(Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation, are not 
citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Because <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN> has a sister, who is a  citizen and resident of Iran, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a country which is undisputedly hostile to the Government of the 
United States, Applicant has a very heavy burden of showing that this family member does not pose a security risk. ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (October 16, 2002). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN>  in-laws, who are 
citizens and residents of Bolivia also come within DC (E2.A2.1.2.1.), immediate family members, or persons to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, are citizens of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country.  Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including the lack of government involvement of Applicant's family members, 
Applicant's powerful attachment to his wife and son in the United States and to the United States, itself, I have determined that sister in Iran, with whom he does not have a close relationship and 
his in-laws in Bolivia, with whom he never communicates, do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and MC (E2.A2.1.3.1.), a determination that the immediate family members, in question 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States, 
applies. </P> 
 
<P>After considering all of the evidence of record on this issue, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR, and even in the unlikely event pressure 
was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would reject it, and would  report the incident to the proper authorities. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3. Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 to the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline C:  FOR APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:  For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 2. Guideline B:  FOR APPLICANT</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. </P>
