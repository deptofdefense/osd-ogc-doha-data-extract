<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On June 23, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed, sworn statement, dated July 26, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel 
submitted the Department's written case, which was prepared on November 18, 2005. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the 
opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant filed a timely response to the FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">January</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 23</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered nine documentary exhibits (Items 1- 9).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant subsequently offered a two page statement and nine pages of  documentary evidence into the record in 
response to the FORM, which has been marked collectively as Item A. All of the exhibits  have been admitted into evidence without objection. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains four 
allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., under Guideline J, and five allegations, 2.a. through 2.e., under Guideline E. In his Response to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 
1.d., 2.a. and 2.c.  He denied 2.b, 2.d., and 2.e. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the FORM,  and the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration of that 
evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 60 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1  (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal acts. Applicant's conduct that occurred in 1978, 1995, and 2001, and which has 
been alleged in the SOR as 1.a., through 1.c. respectively, is included in this paragraph as criminal conduct.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1.a. On April 24, 1978, Applicant was arrested and charged with House Breaking, Larceny. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On May 2, 1978, Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> access to classified material was suspended by the Department of the Army 
as a result of this arrest (Item 7).<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> denied that he was aware that his access had been suspended (Item 2). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was 31 years old when this incident occurred. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1.b. On January 11, 1995, Applicant took a scanner valued at $259 without paying for it from an army post exchange. He was arrested and charged with Shoplifting. He plead nolo contendere, and 
he was placed on six months probation (Item 8). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was 48 years old when this incident occurred. </SPAN></P>

On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">November</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 23, 2001, Applicant was arrested and charged with Larceny of AAFES Property, Shoplifting for attempting to take a bottle of perfume without paying for it from an army post 
exchange. He was placed on one year probation (Item 9).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was 54 years old when this incident occurred. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1.d.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The Government alleges under 2.a. through 2.e., of the SOR that</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> information furnished to the Government by </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was materially incorrect or untrue.  Such conduct, which is discussed 
below, constitutes a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code 1001, which is a felony. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has exhibited questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2.a. Applicant completed a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">SCA</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">September</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 24, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Question #22 of the SCA asked whether in the last 7 years Applicant was arrested, charged with or convicted of any offense not listed in 
modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25 of the SCA. Applicant answered "No" to this question. He should have answered "Yes" and listed the incidents, in which he was arrested and charged with Shoplifting 
in 2001, as alleged in1.c., of the SOR and discussed above.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2.b.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Question #32 of the SCA asked whether to Applicant's knowledge he ever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended or revoked. Applicant answered "No" to this question. The 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> argues that Applicant should have answered "Yes" and included the information regarding his having his access authorization suspended in 1978, as set forth in 1.a., above. In Items 2 
and A, Applicant claimed that he was never aware that his access authorization was suspended in 1978. I find that the his consistent denial that he was unaware of his suspension is credible, and the 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> has not established that he was aware that his access was suspended. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2.c. In a signed, sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">January</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 7, 2004, after an interview with a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) Applicant stated that his 2001 Shoplifting arrest was the first 
time that he had been engaged in an incident such as this or any criminal conduct (Item 5). Applicant knowingly and deliberately failed to disclose his arrests for criminal conduct as alleged in 1.a. 
and 1.b., above.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2.d. In the signed, sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">January</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 7, 2004, Applicant stated that he was not aware that the perfume bottle, which was the reason for his 2001 shoplifting arrest, was in his pocket 
when he left the post exchange (Item 5). In a subsequent sworn statement, dated May 23, 2004, Applicant admitted that he knew he had not paid for the perfume when he attempted to exit the store 
(Item 6).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">2.e. In the signed, sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">January</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 7, 2004, Applicant stated that he did not intend to steal the scanner when he left the post exchange (Item 5). In a subsequent sworn statement, dated 
ay 23, 2004, Applicant admitted that he knew he had not paid for the scanner when he attempted to exit the store (Item 6). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether 
a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall 
common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable 
participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in 
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and 
circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a 
case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to establish 
his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise 
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security 
clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh 
the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. This the Applicant 
has not done.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Since this matter is being decided without a hearing, my evaluation is necessarily limited to the contents of the various documents that are found in the case file.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based on the evidence submitted, I conclude that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">engaged in criminal conduct, including House Breaking and Shoplifting, in 1978, 1995, and 2001. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Additionally, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">'s failure to 
list this conduct on his SCA and in a statement made to an Agent of the DSS, is criminal conduct under Title 18 of the United States Code, Section 1001. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Both Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A10.1.2., allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, and DC E2.A10.1.2.1., a single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses, apply in this case.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guidelines E, the evidence establishes that Applicant knowingly provided less than complete material information to the Government in questions on a SCA that he executed on 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">September</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 24, 2002, and in a sworn statement made on January 7, 2004. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such 
an individual intentionally falsifies material facts, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of clearance holders.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> because the information </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that Applicant provided in his SCA was known by him to be </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">an omission and
