<P>Applicant has over $25,000.00 worth of unpaid debts.  He did not provide a plausible explanation nor did he submit any documentation supporting the notion 
he had  taken the necessary steps to resolve his financial difficulties.  He also was convicted of second degree forgery for attempting to transfer his "sister's"

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 6, 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-21309.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 11, 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2005.  On July 20, 2005, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling a hearing on September 14, 2005.  On September 
10, 2005, Applicant submitted a continuance request with supporting documentation requesting his hearing be continued.  For good cause shown, I granted 
Applicant's request.  On October 11, 2005, DOHA issued an amended notice of hearing rescheduling the hearing on October 27, 2005.  The hearing was 
conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel identified the following discrepancies in the SOR: &para; 1.p. was a duplicate of &para; 1.n., the word "Hospital" needed to be deleted from &para; 1.s., 
the words "Pro Page, Inc., needed to be substitued in lieu of "St. Joseph's Hospital in &para; 1.v., &para; 1.gg. was a duplicate of &para; 1.bb., and &para; 1.ii. was a duplicate of &para; 
1.hh.  Tr. 12-13.  Accordingly, &para;&para; 1.p., 1.gg., and 1.ii. were withdrawn.  The government offered seven documents, which were admitted without objection as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7.  The Applicant had previously offered one set of documents, which contained his continuance request and supporting 
documentation, which was admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A.  DOHA received the transcript on November 9, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's partial admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 52-year-old married man, who has been married to his first and only wife since September 1993.  They have no children.  He attended college 
from January 1972 to June 1972 and estimates he earned about 15 credit hours.  Applicant served in the Air Force from February 1973 to July 1974, and was 
discharged as "unsuitable for military duty."  Tr. 71.  Applicant served in the Navy from September 1977 to July 1985, and was discharged as a Seaman, pay 
grade E-3, with an honorable discharge.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since March 2001, Applicant has been working for his defense contractor employer.  He is on a three-year extended work assignment from his base location 
working as a shipfitter journeyman.  He seeks a security clearance as job requirement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.jj. alleged 36 separate debts.  Having withdrawn &para;&para; 1.p., 1.gg., 1.ii.,  left remaining 33 separate debts totaling $25,534.00.  Applicant 
produced no evidence in his Response to his SOR or at his hearing that he had made any recent effort to contact his creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.  In 
his Response to Interrogatories from April 2004, Applicant did attach copies of letters dated June 2004 to many of his creditors making inquiries about debts.  
GE 5. Applicant provided no evidence of follow-up.  He testified, "When I first got the notice of hearings and everything, I contacted - sent them a letter, the 
[credit reporting agency], asking them to explain these questioned debts.  And I never received anything back, . . ., and I just got busy and forgot all about 
keeping track of it."  Tr. 23.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 2003, Applicant provided a sworn statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS) in which he stated, "I was unaware of the delinquent debts identified 
on my Credit Bureau Report (CBR) prior to reviewing my CBR as part of my DSS interview/investigation.  It is my intent to contact these creditors and 
completely satisfy these debts if legally required to do so whenever I am able to do so.  Otherwise, I will take whatever steps necessary to include contacting a 
consumer credit counseling service or possibly filing bankruptcy if necessary."  GE 4.  At hearing, Applicant submitted no evidence of taking the necessary 
steps to resolve his financial difficulties in the last three years.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not sought any professional assistance in resolving his credit problems.  Tr. 45.  Testifying on the subject of seeking assistance from a credit 
counselor, "I'm open to it, but I just haven't done it."  Tr. 45.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife has been ill for many years suffering from diabetes.  She has also had approximately 15 strokes since approximately 1998.  At age 51, her 
mobility is limited and she requires the use of a walker.  Tr. 43-44.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Pursuant to his plea of no contest in September 2003, Applicant was convicted of second degree forgery for attempting to convey his "sister's" mobile home to 
himself.  He explained the sordid affair arose from a misunderstanding.  He court sentenced him to a diversion program in which his conviction would be 
removed upon three years of good behavior.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not offer any character evidence or employee evaluations. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had 36 debts.  Having withdrawn three of the debts, a remaining 33 debts remain totaling $25,534 (&para;&para; 1.a. through 1.jj.).  
<EM>The Concern:  </EM>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline F by Applicant's admissions and evidence submitted.  His inability to satisfy his outstanding financial 
obligations gives rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. <EM>(A history of not meeting financial obligations); </EM>and FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3. <EM>(Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's failure to provide one piece of evidence in Response to SOR or at his hearing, did little to demonstrate that he has or will attain financial solvency.  
In fact, his  lack of engagement in the process suggests he has little or no motive to resolve past debt.  His promise in 2003 to DSS to take the necessary steps to 
gain control of his finances rings hollow in light of his past action or more correctly, lack of past action.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His wife's sustained illness could potentially raise Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. <EM>(The conditions that resulted 
in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,. . . , unexpected medical emergency, . . . ).  </EM>However, there is little or no evidence to support the 
notion that Applicant's wife sustained an unexpected medical emergency, but rather has sustained an ongoing medical condition since at least 1998.<EM>  </EM>Applicant 
from his actions and demeanor appears to be taking an indifferent approach to paying his wife's medical bills not covered by insurance.  In short, no mitigating 
conditions apply.  I find against Applicant on this concern.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct </STRONG><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was charged with 2<SUP>nd</SUP> degree forgery in May 2003.  The evidence at hearing confirmed Applicant plead "no contest" and 
was sentenced to a diversion program.  <EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conviction of 2<SUP>nd</SUP> degree forgery pursuant to his plea speaks for itself and gives rise to Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 
E.2.A5.1.2.5. <EM> (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the 
agency).  </EM>Nothing Applicant offered as an explanation could be construed as mitigating and therefore no mitigating conditions apply.  I find against Applicant 
on this concern.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's response and demeanor to this process can at best be described as disinterested and unengaged.  Since the time he was put on notice in 2003 that 
security concerns were identified placing his clearance at risk, he has done little if anything to exert the necessary effort to take mitigating action. <EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the totality of the circumstances , I find against Applicant on SOR &para;&para; 1.and 2.  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P>
