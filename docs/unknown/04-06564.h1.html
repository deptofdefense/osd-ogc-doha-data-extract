<P>Applicant has worked for a defense contractor for the last ten years. In December 2003, he married a woman born in the People's Republic of China, who now 
resides with him in the United States. They are expecting a baby in January 2006. While he has no real contact with her family, she continues to have regular 
contact with her father and sister who live in the People's Republic of China. He has mitigated the government's concerns under Guideline B. Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On April 15, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR details reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the Directive. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  </P> 
<P>On May 3, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. This matter was assigned to me on August 1, 2005. A 
notice of hearing was issued on August 2, 2005, and a hearing was held on September 7, 2005. Two exhibits marked Government Exhibits 1 and 2 were 
admitted into evidence. Applicant submitted 13 exhibits marked as Applicant's Exhibits A through M, which were admitted into evidence. The government 
submitted seven documents marked hearing exhibits I through VII for administrative notice,<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Applicant submitted one document for administrative notice, 
marked as Applicant's Exhibit N. These documents were accepted for purposes of administrative notice. Three witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant, who 
also testified on his own behalf. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on September 19, 2005.</P>

<P>Applicant admitted the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d of the SOR.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against him.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_62_"><SUP> (62)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_63_"><SUP> (63)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_64_"><SUP> (64)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_65_"><SUP> (65)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be " in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_66_"><SUP> (66)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence - Guideline B: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may</EM> be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline B. Based on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>An 
immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country</EM>) applies in this case. Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and 
sisters. Applicant's wife is a citizen of China. This "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information."<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_67_"><SUP> (67)</SUP></A> The mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_68_"><SUP> (68)</SUP></A> However, 
such ties do raise a <EM>prima facie</EM> security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the 
applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_69_"><SUP> (69)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Although the definition of family member in Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 does not include in-laws, the Appeal Board has opined that it includes a rebuttable 
presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse. <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154, at 4, 
fn 4 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (Feb. 20, 2002))(Sept,25,2005). Applicant's father-in-law, mother-in-law, two brothers-in-law and sister-in-law are 
citizens of the People's Republic of China and live there. Applicant has no contact with his mother-in-law and brothers-in-law. His only contact with his father-in-law and sister-in-law is to say "hi" when either calls to talk with his wife. However, in light of the Appeal Board's decision, his in-laws may also pose a 
security risk.</P> 
<P>FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2 (<EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or 
duress exists</EM>) also applies. As already stated, Applicant's wife is a citizen of China. She now resides with him in the United States. Applicant must present 
evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the Applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for him.<A HREF="04-06564.h1.html#N_70_"><SUP> (70)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>I have considered the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) and concluded that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>A determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States)</EM> applies. 
Applicant's wife does not work. She did not work for the Chinese government or military prior to entering the United States. She worked in the real estate 
business, which does not make her an agent of a foreign power. Applicant must also show that his immediate family members or other persons to whom he may 
have close ties of affection or obligation are not in a position to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to the persons 
involved and the United States. He has no immediate family members living outside the United States. His closest family member is his wife, who lives with 
him, and soon they will have a baby daughter, whose anticipated birth will be in the United States. Because these family members are in the United States, they 
are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation.</P> 
<P>His wife is taking all the necessary steps to obtain permanent resident status in the United States. Due to a bureaucratic mix-up, and not her inactivity, her 
efforts have been slowed, and it is expected that the process will finalize shortly. She is learning English. She has not resided in the United States long enough 
to apply for citizenship. She also has made no effort to return to China. Applicant has mitigated the government's concerns under Guideline B as it relates to his 
wife.</P> 
<P>Applicant has also rebutted the Appeal Board's presumption under FI DC E2.A2.1.2.1. as to his in-laws. His testimony showed that he does not have close ties 
of affection or sense of obligation to his in-laws. He does not talk with any members of his wife's family, except he may say "hi" to his sister-in-law or father-in-law if they call his home. He has never met his mother-in-law or brothers-in-law. He credibly testified at the hearing testimony that he has could not do 
anything to help his wife's family should the Chinese government decide to assert pressure on them. He reported to his security office the incident where his 
picture was taken almost immediately when he arrived in mainland China. He also reported to his security office his intention to travel to China, his 
engagement to a Chinese national, and his subsequent marriage. He would report contacts to the security office, should any occur. Applicant has also mitigated 
the government's concerns under Guideline B as it relates to his in-laws.</P> 
<P>FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. (<EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>) also applies. As previously stated, Applicant has never met 
his mother-in-law, two brothers-in-law and sister-in-law. Beyond "hi" on the telephone to his father-in-law and sister-in-law, he has no contact with any of his 
wife's family members. He does not speak Chinese and they do not speak English. This lack of personal contact with his wife's family indicates an absence of 
affection. His wife has no contact with either of her brothers. Although her mother and father now live together, she only talks to her father. Because her mother 
did not raise her, she never developed close ties to her and remains very emotionally distant from her mother. Her lack of strong emotional ties with her 
brothers and mother strengthens the lack of affection between both she and Applicant and her family. He provides no financial support to her family nor have 
they asked for any support from him. It is clear from his hearing testimony that he does not have a feeling of obligation to his wife's family. Since he has almost 
no contact with his wife's family, he has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B.</P> 
<P>Applicant traveled to Hong Kong and mainland China only because the United States government required him to meet his prospective wife in person before 
granting her a fiancee visa. During his stay in Hong Kong, he spent the entire time with his wife. In China, he met her father and two of her friends. He spent no 
time with anyone else and did not report any unusual contacts by government representatives, although he did report the picture taking incident. His decision to 
travel to China was at the direction of the United States government, thus, it is not a negative to him. Applicant has mitigated the government's concerns under 
Guideline B, as it relates to his trip to China and Hong Kong.</P> 
<P>Finally, I have considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I am persuaded by the 
evidence in this case that Applicant would not be vulnerable to pressure or duress from a foreign power or the government of the Peoples Republic of China. It 
is clear that he is cognizant of his duties in protecting national security, as he done so in the past. While his personal circumstances have changed, his wife 
resides in the United States, as will his soon to be daughter. Neither he nor his wife plan any trips to China in the near future. The possibility of pressure being 
exerted upon his wife and child by a foreign power or entity does not exist, thus his is not at risk. Applicant has mitigated the government's case under 
Guideline B. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
