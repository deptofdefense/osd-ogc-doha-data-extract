<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old married man employed by a defense contractor as a computer help-desk technician with a history of financial problems (three NSF 
checks resulting in criminal charges, delinquent accounts with nine creditors for a total of nearly $16,000, and a proposed bankruptcy petition that includes 
$131,500 in debt owed to 44 creditors). Although he intends to resolve his indebtedness via a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding, additional time is necessary 
before Applicant can establish a track record of financial responsibility and stability sufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by his financial 
irresponsibility. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On July 14, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. </P> 
<P>On August 2, 2002, Applicant answered the SOR, and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record. In his Answer, Applicant admits to the SOR 
allegations (subparagraphs 1.a - 1.m).</P> 
<P>On October 23, 2002, DOHA assigned this case to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. Thereafter, on December 2, 2002, a notice of hearing 
was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for December 18, 2002, at a location near Applicant's place of employment. </P> 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 3); no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, offered 
his own testimony and that of one character witness, and offered three documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - C). DOHA received the hearing transcript on January 
2, 2003. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old married man. He and his spouse have two children, ages 3 years and 7 months. Applicant's first marriage ended in divorce in April 
1992. That marriage produced one child, a daughter, who is now 14-years-old. Applicant obtained custody of that child and she lived with Applicant until 
recently when she elected to reside with her mother.</P> 
<P>Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as a help-desk technician where he is responsible for setting up computers and assisting others in operating 
computers. He's worked for this company since October 2001. Previously, he worked for the company as a temporary employee and was subsequently hired 
based on his successful duty performance. In conjunction with his current employment, Applicant has applied to obtain a security clearance. </P> 
<P>The company security manager vouched for Applicant's application. The security manager--a retired Marine first sergeant who has worked continuously in 
industrial security since 1987--is of the opinion that Applicant is honest, truthful, and not a security threat. The witness also indicated that during the 
application process Applicant was very candid and up-front that he had experienced financial problems. That testimony is consistent with Applicant's security-clearance application<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> wherein Applicant revealed many debts in response to the appropriate questions.</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges--and Applicant admits--the following: (1) he wrote three worthless or NSF checks in 1995-97 resulting in criminal charges in state court; (2) 
he is indebted to nine creditors for delinquent accounts (two for outstanding balances after car repossessions, one credit card account, one electrical bill, three 
medical bills, one car insurance bill, and one veterinary bill) for a total of nearly $16,000; and (3) he has little remaining money after expenses to pay his past 
due debts and plans on file for bankruptcy within the next 90 days. During the hearing, it was established that Applicant paid the three NSF checks, the 
remaining nine delinquent accounts are unsatisfied  with essentially no payments (beyond a few token payments) being made for some time, and Applicant has 
yet to file for bankruptcy, although he has retained legal counsel for that purpose.</P> 
<P>Concerning the bankruptcy, Applicant plans to file a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> To that end, Applicant presented a 
copy of the proposed Schedule F, which is a list of creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims Applicant seeks to discharge in bankruptcy. The schedule, 
which was prepared by his bankruptcy attorney, contains 44 creditors totaling about $131,500 in debt, including a residential foreclosure for $82,000.  </P> 
<P>Applicant attributes his financial troubles to his April 1992 divorce, his failed attempt to operate an internet service provider (ISP) business during 1996 - 1998, 
the unexpected loss of a job  at the end of June 2001 resulting in unemployment until on or about October 4, 2001. Applicant then started working as a 
contractor for his current employer and was made a regular employee shortly thereafter. Applicant also acknowledges he and his spouse have lived beyond their 
means, he is currently in no position to pay off his delinquent debts, and he has reluctantly decided bankruptcy is the only real option.</P> 
<P>Concerning his 1992 divorce, Applicant received custody of his daughter. He was not required to pay child support, alimony, or other court-ordered payments. 
His spouse was required to pay a nominal amount of child support, but for the most part she paid nothing.</P> 
<P>Concerning the failed ISP business, Applicant, while employed full time at another job, operated his company from about February 1996 to September 1998. 
Doing business as a S corporation, the firm failed because Applicant and his partner neglected the proper billing of customers. Applicant testified that he has no 
corporate debt stemming from the  business failure as the initial start-up funds of about $15,000 was obtained without expectation of repayment. </P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>    <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility. Chief among them is the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the 
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following adjudication guidelines are most 
pertinent here: Guideline F for financial considerations.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant 
has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against them.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in their obligation to protect 
classified information. <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline F. The record shows (1) a history of not meeting 
financial obligations, (2) illegal financial practices, and (3) inability to satisfy debts.<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The NSF checks, two car repossessions, the foreclosure, the other 
delinquent accounts, and the $131,500 of debt revealed in the Schedule F support these conclusions. The same facts also support a conclusion of financial 
irresponsibility. His financial irresponsibility is a security concern because it raises the possibility he may be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless 
in his obligation to properly safeguard or handle classified information. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline F and, given the record evidence, conclude none apply. Of the six, MC 3<A HREF="02-11419.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> is the only 
condition that deserves serious consideration. It does not apply, however, because Applicant's circumstances were not the primary reasons for his financial 
problems. Indeed, the divorce occurred more than 10 years ago and he was not burdened with substantial debt or other payment obligations. Likewise, the 
business failure did not result in corporate debt. And his unemployment in 2001 was for about four months, a relatively brief period considering the extent of 
Applicant's financial problems.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To his credit, </SPAN>Applicant has recently taken the first step toward resolving the financial problems by pursuing bankruptcy.  If a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition is 
filed and a discharge granted, he and his spouse will be released from personal liability for their pre-bankruptcy debts   (except for any debts that are exempted, 
non-dischargeable, or reaffirmed). The discharge would also provide a financial "fresh start" free from the pressures of the indebtedness. But based on the 
record before me, a petition has yet to be filed, and so I cannot give this matter much weight because it is a future event that may or may not happen. 
Accordingly, the record evidence is insufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant's financial problems.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>To sum up under Guideline F, the record evidence shows Applicant has a history of financial difficulties attributed to financial irresponsibility. At this time, I 
assess the likelihood of recurrence as average. And I have weighed the record evidence--both favorable and unfavorable--and conclude Applicant has not 
established, at this time, that it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" that he should be granted the privilege of a security clearance. Time will tell if 
his financial irresponsibility is a thing of the past or a firmly established part of his character. Until he can establish a track record of financial responsibility and 
stability, security concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>
