<P>Applicant emigrated from India with her family in May 1988 when she was nine years old.  With the acquisition of United States citizenship by naturalization 
in June 1999, she renounced her Indian citizenship.  She continued to possess an Indian passport issued to her in 1993, giving no thought to its surrender as it 
was no longer valid for travel.  Applicant did not report her possession of that foreign passport on her October 2000 security clearance application, as she 
thought disclosure was required of only those foreign passports in current use.  At her request, Applicant's foreign passport has since been formally cancelled 
and her renunciation of her Indian citizenship formally acknowledged by Indian consular officials.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 6, 
2002, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct 
proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.  The SOR was based on foreign preference (guideline C) related 
to her possession of a foreign passport and on personal conduct (guideline E) because of her failure to disclose on an October 2000 security clearance 
application that she had held within  the last seven years an active passport issued by a foreign government.</P> 
<P>Applicant filed an undated response to the allegations set forth in the SOR in which she requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This 
response was received by DOHA on March 5, 2002, and on March 26, 2002, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing.  Pursuant to formal notice dated 
arch 29, 2002, a hearing was scheduled for April 24, 2002.  At the hearing, prior to the introduction of any evidence, the Government moved to amend 
subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR to delete the reference to Applicant's foreign passport not expiring until June 2003, based on the cancellation of Applicant's 
Indian passport by the foreign consulate.  Applicant having no objection thereto, the motion was granted.  The Government during its case in chief submitted 
two documents, Applicant's October 2000 security clearance application and April 2001 signed, sworn statement.  Applicant entered one exhibit, a document 
from the consulate confirming renunciation of her Indian citizenship and cancellation of her Indian passport, and testified on her behalf.  With the receipt on 
ay 3, 2002, of the transcript of the hearing, the case is ripe for a decision.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a thorough review of the evidence, and on due consideration of the same, I render the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 23-year-old naturalized citizen of the United States, who has been employed as a software engineer by a United States defense contractor since 
October 2000.  Granted an Interim Secret security clearance for her duties, Applicant seeks a final grant of the Secret security clearance.</P> 
<P>Applicant was born in the Republic of India in August 1968 to resident citizens of that nation.  Circa May 1988, Applicant emigrated with her family (parents 
and two older sisters) to the United States.  Applicant was educated in the local public school system, where she was exposed to the cultural influences of,  and 
given opportunities afforded, United States native-born citizens.</P> 
<P>While still in high school, Applicant traveled to India with her family for three weeks in December 1992/January 1993 to visit family members (grandparents, 
aunts and uncles) who remain resident citizens of India.  A citizen of India, she traveled on a passport issued by that nation.  In early June 1993, Applicant's 
Indian passport was renewed by the Consulate General of India in the United States.</P> 
<P>Following her graduation from high school, Applicant in September 1996 commenced her undergraduate studies in computer science at a nearby university.  In 
June 1998, Applicant traveled to Canada with family members.  Applicant presented her "green card" at the border of the United States and Canada.</P> 
<P>In June 1999, Applicant became a United States naturalized citizen, taking an oath to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support and defend the United States 
Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the United States if required.  Her acquisition of United 
States citizenship operated as a renunciation of her Indian citizenship.  The day after she became a United States naturalized citizen, she was issued a United 
States passport.  Not asked to turn over her foreign passport, Applicant was unaware of any requirement to relinquish the passport or of any procedures to effect 
its surrender.</P> 
<P>In January 2000, Applicant married in the United States a citizen of the Republic of India whom she had met while he was in the United States on a working 
visa.  Applicant has not discussed with him his intentions with respect to future acquisition of United States citizenship.</P> 
<P>On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum clarifying 
the foreign preference adjudicative guideline with respect to the use and/or possession of a foreign passport to the effect that clearance is to be denied or 
revoked unless an applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States government.</P> 
<P>In September 2000, Applicant was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree, <EM>cum laude</EM>, in computer science.  The following month, she started working as a 
computer software engineer for her current employer.  In conjunction with her defense-related duties, Applicant executed on October 30, 2000, a security 
clearance application (SF 86) on which she disclosed her birth in the Republic of India, her acquisition of United States naturalized citizenship and United 
States passport in June 1999, the United States residency and citizenship through naturalization of her father and two sisters, and the Indian citizenship and 
United States residency of her mother.<A HREF="01-15345.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant answered "No" to question 15 on the form ["In the last 7 years, have you had an active passport that was 
issued by a foreign government?"].  Equating in her mind the term "active passport" with current use of a foreign passport, Applicant did not disclose her 
possession of a foreign passport, which had been rendered invalid because of her acquisition of United States citizenship.</P> 
<P>In December 2000, Applicant traveled to India for five weeks with her spouse to visit his gravely ill father who died during their stay.  During that visit to India, 
Applicant stayed with his spouse's sister and his uncle, who reside together.  Applicant also visited with her maternal grandparents, her paternal grandmother, 
as well as some of her father's siblings, all of whom remain resident citizens of India.  Applicant traveled to India on her United States passport.</P> 
<P>In April 2001, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS).  Applicant disclosed infrequent contact with family 
members in India who are either farmers or homemakers.  Regarding the Indian citizenship of some members of her immediate family, Applicant explained her 
mother had not become a United States citizen because she is not proficient in the English language and does not feel capable of passing the required 
examination.  Applicant indicated she was unaware of her spouse's intentions with regard to acquiring United States citizenship, but added he was working as a 
software engineer for a United States corporation in an unclassified facility.  Applicant volunteered to the agent that she possessed both United States and 
Indian passports.  Expressing a willingness to relinquish her foreign passport, Applicant indicated she was unaware of the procedures for proper surrender.  
Applicant presented her foreign passport to the agent to confirm she had not used it since January 1993.  Denying any intent to use the foreign passport in the 
future, Applicant offered the foreign passport to the agent.  Her passport was returned to her with the advice that she retain it for the time being.  Applicant 
indicated she did not maintain dual citizenship status with India, and she  expressed loyalty to the United States.</P> 
<P>On February 6, 2002, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant alleging foreign preference concerns related to her possessing a passport issued by the Republic of 
India, and personal conduct concerns related to her failing to disclose her possession of that foreign passport on her SF 86.  On receipt of the SOR, Applicant 
was apprised of the ASDC<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum regarding the use and possession of foreign passports.  On learning that she should not be in possession of a foreign 
passport, Applicant forwarded her passport to the Consulate General of India for cancellation.  On or before March 20, 2002, the consulate cancelled 
Applicant's Indian passport, noting she had renounced her Indian citizenship and acquired "United States Nationality."</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination  required.  
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section

</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and 
establishes conduct cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue her security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  Any doubt as to whether access 
to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security.  <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive, Section 
E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of the Applicant, I conclude 
the following with respect to guidelines C and E:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Born in the Republic of India, Applicant emigrated to the United States with her parents and sisters when she was a child.  She attended public schools in her 
local community in the United States.  At age fourteen, she traveled on an Indian passport to India with her family to see relatives.  Six months after her return, 
her foreign passport was renewed by the Indian consulate in the United States.  Her use and renewal of the foreign passport at that time do not raise foreign 
preference concerns, as they occurred before she acquired United States citizenship.<A HREF="01-15345.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Following her high school graduation, Applicant in September 1996 
pursued her undergraduate degree at a university in this country.  In June 1999, she acquired United States naturalized citizenship, which operated as a 
renunciation of her foreign citizenship.  The day after she became a United States citizen, she was issued a United States passport.  She elected to pursue gainful 
employment in the United States on earning her bachelor's degree, and in October 2000 she commenced work for a United States defense contractor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's conduct has been largely consistent with her United States citizenship, she continued to possess her Indian passport until 2002.  Possession 
of a foreign passport after acquisition of United States citizenship is potentially disqualifying under guideline C (<EM>see</EM> E2.A3.1.2.2.).  As set forth by the ASDC<SUP>3</SUP>I 
in his August 2000 memorandum clarifying the foreign preference guideline with respect to the possession and/or use of a foreign passport, possession of a 
foreign passport could facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States and it raises doubts of primary allegiance.  Although Applicant's acquisition of 
United States citizenship operated as a renunciation of her foreign citizenship, there is no evidence the Indian authorities were apprised of her change in 
citizenship status until 2002.  Travel on her Indian passport may well have remained a viable option for her until the passport's recent cancellation.  However, 
as confirmed by her use of her United States passport for travel to India in December 2000, Applicant had no intent to travel on that Indian passport.  With the 
understanding that India does not recognize dual citizenship, Applicant did not consider this passport to be valid for travel after she acquired her United States 
citizenship.  Her retention of her foreign passport was not intended as an act of foreign preference.  As of her DSS interview in April 2001, Applicant was 
willing to surrender her foreign passport to the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's benign reason for possessing the foreign passport notwithstanding, revocation of her security clearance is required unless she surrenders the foreign 
passport or obtains official approval from the United States Government for its use.  On learning of that requirement, Applicant forwarded her Indian passport 
to the Consulate General of India.  With the cancellation of her foreign passport on or before March 20, 2002, foreign preference concerns related to possession 
and/or use of the Indian passport have been mitigated.  While Applicant continues to have cultural ties to India,<A HREF="01-15345.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> there is little likelihood, if any, that she will act 
in preference to India over the United States.  Subparagraph 1.a. (as amended) is resolved in her favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not disclose her possession of that foreign passport on  her security clearance application executed in October 2000.  Personal conduct (guideline 
E) concerns exist where the omission of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire was deliberate (<EM>see</EM> E2.A5.1.2.2.).  Applicant 
explained that she misinterpreted question 15 [In the last 7 years, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign government?"], and thought it 
applied only to current use of a foreign passport.  Given that Applicant understood her foreign passport to be no longer valid as of the time she executed the SF 
86, and she had not used the Indian passport for travel since January 1993, her denial of any intentional misrepresentation is accepted.   Applicant brought her 
foreign passport with her to her DSS interview in April 2001, but her purpose in doing so was not to correct an earlier act of known concealment.  Rather, she 
presented the document to the DSS agent to confirm no active use.  Subparagraph 2.a. is found for the Applicant, as her negative response to question 15 on the 
SF 86 was not an act of deliberate concealment or falsification.</SPAN></P>
