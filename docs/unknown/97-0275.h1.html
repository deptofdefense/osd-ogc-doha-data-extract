</P>

<P>	On April 15, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated May 3, 1997, the Applicant responded to
the allegations set forth in the SOR and elected to have his case decided on a written record, in lieu
of a hearing.  A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>	The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) on June 26,
1997.  The Applicant also received an opportunity then to file objections and submit material in
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant responded to the FORM on July 22, 1997, and
his response was received by DOHA on July 25, 1997.  The record in this case closed on July 25,
1997.  The case was assigned on July 28, 1997, to Chief Administrative Judge Gales and reassigned
to the undersigned Administrative Judge for caseload reasons on August 1, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on a single criterion:
paragraph 1, Criterion G (alcohol consumption).  The Applicant has admitted the factual allegations
contained in each of the subparagraphs of the SOR.<A HREF="97-0275.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Except as noted herein, the Applicant's
admissions are hereby incorporated as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	The Applicant is a 51-year-old electrical engineer employed by a U.S. Government
contractor.  The Applicant seeks to obtain a personnel security clearance.  He held a personnel
security clearance continuously from 1968 when he was graduated from college until January 1994
when he resigned and had been employed at his current employment location continuously for nearly
22 years until January 1994.</P>

<P>	The Applicant began consuming alcohol in his late teens.  FORM item 9, page 4.  In
December 1971 he was arrested for driving under the influence of liquor.  FORM item 12.  On
September 28, 1980, he was arrested for Driving While Intoxicated (0.27% BAC) and, upon
pleading no contest in April 1981, was fined and required to complete a driver's safety course. 
FORM item 10, page 2.</P>

<P>	The Applicant believes that he is addicted to alcohol and has been for decades, experiencing
blackouts, seizures, disorientation, and withdrawal symptoms.  FORM item 7, page 1.  There is no
diagnostic evidence, however, that he suffered delirium tremens as alleged in SOR &para; 1.a.  <EM>See</EM> DSM-IV, pages 129-132, 198.  He was sober between December 1976 and July 1978.  Form 9, page 4. 
He was sober from October 1980 until September 1995 and has been sober for seven periods (each
of a year or more) all together.  FORM response, pages 2-3.  The Applicant considered himself a
"binge drinker" who would drink to excess during those time periods when he was drinking.  FORM
response, page 2.  </P>

<P>	In December 1995 the Applicant tried to quit drinking "cold turkey" by himself, suffered
seizure withdrawal symptoms, and had to be treated inpatient for detoxification for six days.  FORM
response, page 3; FORM item 7, page 1.  He was sober from the date of his discharge until he
voluntarily admitted himself for inpatient detoxification for a week in July 1996.  FORM item 7,
page 1.  The Applicant last had an alcoholic drink in June 1996.  FORM response, page 3.</P>

<P>	Except during the two periods of inpatient detoxification treatment, the Applicant has not had
any professional substance abuse treatment, rehabilitation, counseling, or psychiatric treatment. 
FORM response, page 3; FORM item 7, page 1; FORM item 8, page 1; FORM item 9, page 4.  He
has attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings periodically over the years and has sought to
educate himself through the study of literature about alcoholism, its treatment, and the relative risks
of relapse.  FORM item 9, pages 2-3; FORM response, pages 2-5.  The Applicant's work has not
been adversely affected by his alcoholism.  FORM item 9, pages 4-5; FORM response, page 4.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative
guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines
are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant
or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P>	The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an
evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION G - ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses,
and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified
information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include:</STRONG>  </P>

<P>			  (1)	alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as
driving while under the influence, fighting, child or
spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to
alcohol use; </P>

<P>			  (4)	habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point
of impaired judgment; </P>

<P>		<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P>			  (3)	positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety; </P>

<P>	The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors
enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequences involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur
in the future.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following
factors:</P>

<P>		The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes</P>

<P>		The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>		The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding
that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences
and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations
under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>		It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government
to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of
the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the
Board in second-guessing the agency's national security
determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that
Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence
that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial
evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of
the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0275.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose
of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation
of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an
applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold
a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0275.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, the undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criterion
G.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant has had a lengthy alcoholic history involving binges, followed by sobriety,
followed by relapses, <STRONG><EM>etc</EM></STRONG>., and two alcohol-related incidents.  This conduct falls within the scope of
DC #1 and DC #4, identified on page 3 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  The seriousness of his illness is demonstrated by his 
relapse last year months after he was institutionalized for detoxification.  On the other hand, his
voluntary self-admission for a second detoxification program--promptly upon being shocked at his
slip-- and the extensive self-education that he has undertaken since December 1995 weigh positively
for the Applicant.  This conduct falls within MC #3, also identified on page 3 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  Given his long-standing medical history, an inpatient rehabilitation program (not just a detoxification program) of
several weeks' duration, leading to a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional (MC
#4), would seem to be indicated, particularly since the Applicant once relapsed after nearly five years
of continuous sobriety.  In absence of documented diagnoses by credentialed medical professionals,
his inpatient treatment, by itself, is supportive of security clearance eligibility.  Therefore, SOR &para;
1.d. and &para; 1.e. are found favorably to the Applicant.  Likewise, SOR &para;1.f. is concluded favorably to
the Applicant because his intention to remain sober notwithstanding his recognition of its difficulty
is supportive of security clearance eligibility.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Directive requires that the factors listed in Section F.3 and enclosure 2 to the Directive,
identified on page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, be considered, as appropriate, in making this decision.  The seriousness
of the Applicant's mental health problem is large, but he has taken modestly appropriate steps to deal
with it.  The Applicant, however, is still at an "intellectual level" in accepting his disability.  His
strong resolve to remain abstinent based upon an understanding of the nature of his illness weighs
in the Applicant's favor and is the most encouraging evidence in the record.  There is some evidence
of recent rehabilitation although several years of sobriety will be necessary to satisfy legitimate
current personnel security concerns..  This Administrative Judge is unable to find a reasonable
probability that the Applicant at his rather mature age will remain sober the rest of his working life. 
On balance, SOR &para; 1 is found adversely to the Applicant.</FONT></P>

evidence to establish controverted facts (see footnote 3 on page 6 <EM><STRONG>infra</STRONG></EM>), item 7 imposes the <STRONG>further

"providing the applicant with a copy of all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a
