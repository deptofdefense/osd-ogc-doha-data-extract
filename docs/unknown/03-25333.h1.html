</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 10, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline J-Criminal Conduct, it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In response, by letter of January 21, 2005, the Applicant admitted to the sole allegation contained in the 
SOR and requested an administrative determination based on the submissions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on February 24, 2005, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="03-25333.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> was provided to Applicant.  
Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received a copy of the FORM 
on March 7, 2005, but did not submit any additional material.  I received this case on May 11, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has admitted to the allegation set forth in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration 
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 31 year-old male who has been employed as a human factors specialist by a defense contractor since March 2003.  In 2000, while he balanced his 
work as a graduate research assistant with the completion of his Ph.D., Applicant wed.  After graduation, he taught at a local college while he also worked as a 
self-employed human factors specialist in a neighboring state.  In November 2002, Applicant moved in with his parents in that neighboring state while his wife 
stayed behind.  Their marriage ended in divorce in late February 2003, two days after Applicant commenced his current employment and shortly before he 
moved out from his parents' home.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On Sunday, May 25, 2003, Applicant went to a local lounge.  While there, he ran into a number of acquaintances with whom he socialized and caroused for 
several hours.  After his cohorts left, Applicant moved his imbibing to a neighboring pub.  There, he noticed a woman he had seen at the lounge earlier, but to 
whom he did not speak.  At some point, the woman placed her purse on the bar near the Applicant and walked away.  Sometime after midnight, Applicant took 
the woman's purse from the bar, made his way out of the pub, and got as far as the alley.  There, he fumbled through the purse, pocketed her keys, and left the 
remainder of its contents in tact.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the interim, the woman realized her purse was no longer on the bar.  Two witnesses first searched, then found the Applicant in the alley.  As one observed 
him looking in the purloined purse, the other closed in on him.  Once aware of the encroaching witness and before being subdued, Applicant threw the purse 
across the alley.  A passing police office was flagged down and Applicant was taken into custody around 1:00 a.m, charged with misdemeanor theft.  In court, 
he was given a pre-trial diversion, required to attend an alcohol/drug information school, and received a three month probation.  Subsequently, Applicant 
completed the court's requirements.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Throughout the night, Applicant had been upset about his  divorce and was drinking heavily.  He was extremely intoxicated, a state which is rare for him, and 
could not comprehend his actions or fathom why he filched the purse.  Applicant usually only drinks alcohol socially, about twice a month, and three beers is 
his usual limit.  His occasional use of alcohol has not caused him any financial or health related problems, nor has it affected either his personal or professional 
life.  For the seven years prior to his security clearance application, Applicant's record is clean.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct: </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-25333.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-25333.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-25333.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline J, the Government has established its case.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's unbridled consumption of alcoholic beverages and snatching of a fellow pub 
patron's purse create doubt as to his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">J, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) 
E2.A10.1.2.1 is raised in the  presence of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">[</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>llegations</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and, pursuant 
to CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, when there has been </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">[</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a</EM>]</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.  </EM>Here, Applicant committed theft, a crime sufficiently serious 
to raise both disqualifying conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admits the allegation set forth in the SOR.  He was distraught over his divorce and attempted to seek solace through barroom socializing and a rare 
spree of drunken revelry that went beyond his limit.  His resultant drunkenness and muddled thinking led to the taking of the purse. Barring this sole, aberrant 
incident, however, Applicant has neither a record of criminal conduct, nor a record of alcohol or drug abuse.  Further, the facts do not demonstrate that he has 
an alcohol problem.  Instead, this incident appears to be an aberration, an atypical episode, and not a manifestation of questionable judgment, reliability, or 
trustworthiness.  As such, I find </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.2 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM>) applies.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Moreover, although Applicant is unable to discern what he was thinking at the time, the fact remains that his act was volitional.  Given the juxtaposition of 
these facts and the unique issues Applicant was then facing, however, the chance that such factors will ever again recur is not so great as to present a security 
risk.  Therefore, I additionally find CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the person did not voluntarily commit the act </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely 
to recur</SPAN></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Looking at the whole person, Applicant is a well educated young man who has demonstrated academic prowess and diligence, as well as the discipline of self-employment.  He obviously has the support of his parents.  With the exception of this one incident, Applicant's record is thoroughly clean.  Indeed, that record 
does not indicate any prior criminal or alcohol-related incidents, accusations, or arrests, nor does it reveal any signs of general substance abuse or financial 
difficulty.  In sum, Applicant is a young man whose personal achievements and success are only marred by the emotional set back of his recent divorce and this 
one isolated, albeit criminal, incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on the record evidence as a whole, the facts and circumstances in this matter, and Applicant's explanation as to the event at issue, I find that Applicant 
has met his burden in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.  Consequentially, I find 
subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR in Applicant's favor. </SPAN></P>
