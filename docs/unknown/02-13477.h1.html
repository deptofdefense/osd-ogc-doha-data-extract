<P>Applicant, a US citizen by birth, has encountered two alcohol-related incidents in 2000 and 2001, respectively, which he has mitigated by a successful overall 
showing the incidents are unlikely to be repeated in the foreseeable future.  Another claimed security risk is Applicant's sister who resides in Costa Rica.  
However, Applicant's sister is not an unmanageable risk to coercion, pressure or compromise by virtue of any continued ties to Costa Rico: a country with a 
constitutional democracy whose legal traditions include respect for human rights and the rule of law.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on March 4, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on March 28, 2003.  The 
hearing was scheduled  for April 23, 2003, and convened on that date for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on two 
witnesses (including himself) and ten exhibits.  Transcripts (R.T.) of the proceedings were received on May 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, the Government requested official notice be taken of a State Department consular information sheet covering Costa Rica.  There 
being no objections, and good cause being shown, official notice was taken of the consular information sheet.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 38-year old software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks to retain his security clearance, which he has held since 1987.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is alleged to have been involved in two alcohol-related arrests: one in January 2000  on charges of DuI (a misdemeanor), speeding, and spinning tires, 
to which he pleaded no contest to reckless driving, was fined and ordered to attend alcohol awareness and victim's awareness programs, and a second in June 
2001 on charges of DuI and speeding, on which he was convicted of DuI, and sentenced to 30 days of house arrest and 12 months of probation, as well as 
having his license suspended for 6 months and being subjected to various orders: performance of  50 hours of community service, impounding of his vehicle for 
10 days, attendance of other alcohol and victim's awareness programs and submission to random alcohol/drug screening.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have a sibling residing in Costa Rica to which she is bound by affection.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the covered allegations while denying any of the conduct attributable to him reflects questionable 
judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness, or increased vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Applicant claimed no ongoing drinking 
problems, completion of all ordered treatment programs, a  positive prognosis from a licensed psychologist, and outstanding work performance.  Further, 
Applicant claimed infrequent contact with his sister in Costa Rica, but no legal, fiscal or other legal obligations to her.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his separation from his spouse and young daughter in 1999, Applicant began socializing with work colleagues in bars after work.  During a session 
of night sailing with friends (in celebration of his birthday) in the evening of January 29, 2000, he consumed between three and four beers.  While driving home 
from the event, he was pulled over by local police for speeding.  When the officer smelled alcohol on Applicant's breath, he asked him to submit to a field 
sobriety test.  Applicant performed the test and failed the portion of the test requiring him to walk in a straight line and return.  Asked by the investigating 
officer to submit to a Breathalyzer, Applicant refused and was arrested for DuI (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 35).  At his court hearing in March 2000, Applicant pleaded 
innocent to his DuI offense.  He  pleaded no contest to a charge of reckless driving, was fined and ordered to attend alcohol and victim's awareness programs.  
Applicant is credited with satisfying the court's conditions.  Even though he pleaded no contest to a reckless driving charge, his pre-arrest drinking was 
sufficient to classify the incident as alcohol-related.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 2001, Applicant was arrested again: this time for a DuI offense, in which he was charged with both DuI and speeding.  He was later found guilty by the 
convening jury and, in turn, was sentenced to thirty days of house arrest and 12 months of probation.  The court also fined him in the amount of $545.50, 
suspended his license for six months, ordered him to perform 50 hours of community service, ordered his vehicle impounded for ten days, ordered him to attend 
another alcohol awareness program, and ordered him to submit to random alcohol/drug screening.  Applicant is credited with successfully completing each of 
his probation conditions and receiving an early release from probation (<EM>see</EM> exs. H, I and J)<EM>. </EM> During his four months of ordered alcohol counseling, he regularly 
attended psycho-educational groups and weekly AA meetings, without ever identifying with any of the AA members in his chapter.  Applicant's  counselor 
could identify no substance abuse problem or other psychological or interpersonal problem of his. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since his June 2001 arrest, Applicant has encountered no further problems with law enforcement authorities and confines his drinking to occasional drinking at 
home (<EM>see</EM> exs. C and D; R.T., at 45, 78-81, 95-97), never receiving any complaints of excessive drinking.  He no longer attends bars and spends most of his 
evenings at home with his girlfriend.  With his relationship with his daughter and former wife much improved, he spends his weekends now with his daughter 
(<EM>i.e., </EM>every other weekend), often taking her horseback riding and to events.  Having a very heavy work-related travel schedule, Applicant devotes most of his 
off-duty time with his daughter and girlfriend.  His alcohol counselor characterizes Applicant as a low risk for future alcohol abuse (<EM>see</EM> ex. A).  He credits his 
prognosis to Applicant's  life-style changes, which includes increased focus on his parenting responsibilities for his young daughter (<EM>see</EM> ex. A; R.T., at 46-47).    
 </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a highly regarded software engineer with his employer.  Since his original company merged with his current employer in 1994, he has regularly 
received outstanding evaluations and promotions and has been cited with certificates of excellence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant (himself a US citizen by birth) has a sister who resides in Costa Rica.  He does not have a particularly close relationship with his sister and has little 
contact with her:  He communicates with her two to three times per year by either e-mail or telephone.  He has no legal or fiscal relationship with her and has 
visited her just twice since she moved to Costa Rica: last in September 2000 for her wedding.  Costa Rica is a constitutional democracy with a long history of 
respect for human rights and the rule of law (<EM>see</EM> <EM>US State Department Consular Information Sheet </EM>(January 2003).  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) require that each decision  be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon 
consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2.  In making their decisions, judges 
must consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating 
Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to 
assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent 
considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a 
fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a 
foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1: A determination that the immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
decision, appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's suitability for a security clearance depends, in large 
part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable 
and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial evidence any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it 
must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of 
materiality, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information 
before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of accessible risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently 
fail to safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose 
of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a highly regarded software engineer who became involved in two alcohol-related arrests and convictions following separation from his wife and 
young daughter in 1999.  With colleagues from work, he began frequenting local drinking establishments after work.  His two alcohol-related arrests and 
charges came in January 2000, and again in June 2001.   With no prior history of alcohol abuse in his record, these two alcohol-related incidents were 
characterized as criminal incidents in the SOR; although, they represent criminal actions and alcohol-related incidents.</P> 
 
<P>Because the underlying alcohol-related incidents reflect both criminal conduct and judgment lapses, they raise security concerns under both the criminal 
conduct and personal conduct guidelines of the Directive's Adjudicative Guidelines.  Both Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 (alleged or admitted criminal 
conduct) and DC 2 (single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) of the criminal conduct guidelines apply to the facts of this case.  While neither of these 
offenses reflect classic rule violations as they are commonly understood in the private and public domains, they do reflect material judgment lapses of the nature 
covered by the predicate security concerns of Guideline E, and to this extent are covered by this personal conduct guideline.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Assessment of Applicant's alcohol-related criminal conduct must be made on the basis of a review of the entire evidentiary record developed to date, not merely 
the information developed with respect to his identified alcohol abuse and ensuing counseling and abstinence efforts.  In making an overall assessment of 
Applicant's clearance eligibility, major emphasis must be accorded his most recent drinking history, job performance and support he receives from his 
supervisor and work colleagues.  In Applicant's case, his support base remains very strong among those who know him professionally and personally. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions and improved understanding, Applicant demonstrates he has taken the necessary restorative and corrective measures in his personal affairs to 
ensure that he does not repeat the same or similar judgment lapses associated with his prior problems with alcohol abuse.  His mitigation efforts not only reflect 
important curtailing of his drinking (without any further reports  of legal problems), but some sustaining positive steps (such as devoting his off-work time to 
his daughter and girlfriend) to ensure that he does not experience any recurrent alcohol abuse relapses in the future. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's demonstrated efforts to remedy his judgment lapses associated with DuI arrests enable him to take advantage of one mitigating condition (MC) of 
the Adjudication Guidelines for criminal conduct: MC 6 (clear evidence of successful rehabilitation).   Although there are no specific mitigating conditions 
under the Administrative Guidelines for personal conduct applicable to his arrests, his judgment elapses are mitigated by his demonstrated  good judgment and 
responsibility in the performance of his professional responsibilities, as well as the care he has taken to avert any recurrent alcohol-related incidents in the 
future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Altogether, Applicant provides sufficient demonstrative indications of sustained mitigation of his past alcohol-related incidents to overcome any residual 
security risks associated with his past alcohol-related judgment lapses.  Considering the record as a whole, Applicant makes the convincing showing that he has 
both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol to warrant safe predictions that he 
is no longer at risk to judgment impairment associated with such conduct.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the criminal conduct allegations 
covered by Guidelines  J and E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P> Government finds security risks associated with Applicant's sister's (W) taking up residence in Costa Rica.  As a resident of Costa Rica, the Government 
believes W to be vulnerable to pressure and coercion by virtue of her holding residence in this still developing Central American country.  Applicant assures 
any such potential concerns are either non-existent or significantly mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate <EM>per se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines 
covering risks of foreign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  Available source information 
confirms Costa Rica to be a country with  democratic traditions and respect for human rights and the rule of law (<EM>see</EM> <EM>US State Department Consular 
Information Sheet </EM>(January 2003).  Still, Government may invoke two disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative guidelines for foreign influence: DC 1 
(immediate family member or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen or resident or present in a foreign country) and 
DC 6 (conduct that may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign government).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>On its current track, Costa Rica can now be classed as a promising new democracy in the Americas whose security risks to the US are manageable ones. While 
the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the character of the subject country, they should not be construed to 
ignore the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  Costa Rica is a constitutional democracy that does not exhibit hostility to 
the US and relatives of US citizens residing within its <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">borders.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Because of the recognized stable political and economic climate in Costa Rica, security concerns over the status of Applicant's sister's either residing in or 
being linked to Costa Rica's government are considerably reduced.  Mitigation of these concerns now permit safe predictive judgments about Applicant's ability 
to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure attributable to his familial relationship and contacts with his sister domiciled in Costa Rica.  With security risks 
surrounding his sister considered manageable, Applicant may claim the  mitigation benefits of MC 1 (presence of immediate family or associates in host 
country does not pose an unacceptable security risk) of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  Overall, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 2.a 
of Guideline B of the Adjudicative Guidelines.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative 
Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.</SPAN></P>
