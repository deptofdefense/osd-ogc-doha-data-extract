<P>Applicant, a 55-year-old security specialist working on contract for the Department of State, effectively mitigated security concerns arising from a continuing 
romantic relationship with a Russian woman whom he met while on a project for his employer, by reporting the contacts and establishing his own extensive 
record since holding a security clearance received in 1988. Based on a whole person analysis, clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 1, 2005, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry </EM>as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated March 17, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me on July 5, 2005, and a Notice of Hearing was issued August 26, 2005 for a hearing held on September 6, 2005. At the hearing, the Government 
introduced seven exhibits the last six of which were for adminstrative notice. Applicant introduced no exhibits but the record was left open for him to submit 
material and 11 exhibits were offered on October 12, 2005. All were accepted into evidence. The Applicant testified. The transcript was received on September 
19, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the specific facts alleged under Foreign Influence Guideline B with explanatory information provided for all. The admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following additional 
findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as security specialist installing equipment in U.S. embassies and consulates. He has held a 
security clearance for 18 years. He has never had a security violation or been criticized for any security lapse. He is a widower with two grown sons. He served 
two years in the army including service in Viet Nam. He was honorably discharged in 1970 (Exh. K). Later he served in the National Guard with the rank of 
Staff Sergeant working on classified matters and holding a security clearance. He has a high school GED equivalency but has taken many courses in 
information technology to qualify for his present work. </P> 
<P>While working in the Russian Far East for his employer in 2002 he met a 32-year-old Russian woman who works as an accountant for a farm co-operative. He 
reported the contact to the consulate  and to his employer (Exh. A). He returned to conclude the project in May, 2003, saw her again and they developed a 
romantic relationship. He went on to other assignments but corresponded with her and has returned to visit twice on vacation, in November 2003, and in 2004, 
for periods of more than a month each time. He notified his employer of the later trips (Exh. I). He has sent money to her totaling $6-7,000.00 since 2003, to 
help her and her 12 year-old daughter. They exchange e-mails almost daily. He considers marriage a possibility but has taken no steps to do so recognizing the 
difficulties of doing so. He plans to visit her again. She has never traveled from Russia to be with him. </P> 
<P>Applicant has met his friend's sister and daughter but not her parents. He has no contact with her employer organization which has nothing to do with defense 
work. Someone in her employer organization who knew of and objected to her friendship with Applicant reported that she was spying for the U.S. The matter 
was investigated by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and dismissed. The person who reported her contact with Applicant has now been enjoined 
from further contact with her. </P> 
<P>One allegation in the SOR (Par. 1.b.) concerns an alleged spouse-like relationship with a former landlady in the U.S. with whom he had a romantic relationship. 
The government has stated that this matter is no longer of concern (TR. 8). </P> 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded for his skills, dedication to his work, and good character (Exhibits A-G). He travels extensively to embassies and consulates to 
perform work for his employer. His supervisors and customers are very complimentary of his abilities and work ethic. He takes great pride in his work, and 
contributions to national security, especially providing security for our foreign service personnel working abroad. </P> 
<P>The Government has established by official documents of which I have taken official notice that Russia has engaged in espionage seeking economic and 
technical data.(Exh. 2-7). These are matters of serious concern regarding national security and they have been considered in the context of this case. Changes in 
Russia are occurring and improvements in our relations have been noted in recent U.S. Government policy statements noting new cooperative arrangements 
between the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (Exh. 3 p. 51).</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential</P> 
<P>for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only 
when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on 
the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include an immediate family member, or a person to whom the 
individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. (E2.A2.1.2.1.) Based on the evidence of record, including 
Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of foreign influence. Having established such reasons, the 
Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the individuals in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the U.S.(E2.A2.1.3.1.), and contacts 
with foreign citizens are the result of official U.S. Government business (E2.A2.l.3.2.), contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent (E2.A2.1.3.3.), and the individual has promptly reported to proper authorities all contacts, requests, or threats from foreign persons or organizations, 
as required (E2.A2.1.3.4.). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's contacts with his Russian friend are not casual and infrequent so MC 3 would not be applicable and as to MC 1 she is possibly in a position to be 
exploited. MC 2 is applicable to the first two trips since he was traveling abroad on government business. It would not be applicable to the subsequent vacation 
trips. MC4 would be applicable since he reported  the contacts and travel to appropriate authorities.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts 
and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, 
and careful analysis. Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has strong and deep ties to the U.S. over many years of service and work as a member of the armed forces and as an employee of a defense contractor. 
Applicant is an impressive person of skills and dedication to his work who has dealt effectively with security issues for over a quarter of a century. There is no 
evidence to cause one to think his conduct would change now. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents a highly credible case that he would not be influenced by anything anyone might seek him to do any acts contrary to the best interests of the 
U.S. His record of employment, his career as a trusted employee of a defense contractor, and his record while holding a security clearance including notices 
given to those in authority of his relationship that is the subject of this matter effectively refutes any likelihood that he would now take any action that would 
jeopardize national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
