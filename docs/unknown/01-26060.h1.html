<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant used marijuana on a fairly regular basis between 1968 and 1994. He also used cocaine on three occasions between 1969 and 1985, and mescaline 
twice in 1968/69. He has not used any controlled substance since 1994, and convincingly asserts he will never use an illegal controlled substance in the future. 
He also incorrectly answered a question concerning his use of controlled substances in a security clearance application he submitted in 2000 because he 
misunderstood the question. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns caused by his illegal use of controlled substances and the incorrect answer he 
provided in the application. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On December 20, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to 
find it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline E for personal conduct and Guideline H for drug involvement.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on June 26, 2003, and requested a hearing. Applicant admitted all allegations contained 
in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to another administrative judge on September 9, 2003, and reassigned to me on November 21, 2003, due to caseload considerations. A 
notice of hearing was issued on December 2, 2003, scheduling the hearing for December 17, 2003. I cancelled the scheduled hearing because of personal 
reasons, and a new notice of hearing was issued on January 13, 2004, rescheduling the hearing for February 4, 2004. The hearing was conducted as rescheduled.  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government submitted three documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3 and admitted into the record without 
an objection.  Applicant testified at the hearing and did not submit any exhibits. The transcript was received on February 12, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, and consideration of 
the testimony presented, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 57 years old and has been employed by the same defense contractor since 1972. His job title is supplier management, which is essentially a buyer. 
He worked for this same employer from October 1966 to July 1968. He has possessed a secret security clearance since May 1983. No allegations of 
mishandling classified material have been made against him, nor has any action been taken to revoke, suspend, or downgrade his clearance before the action 
herein involved. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been married since April 1977. He has two daughters, ages 24 and 21. The older daughter lives on her own and is employed at a bank. The 
younger daughter is a student and resides with Applicant and his wife. Applicant was previously married in June 1968 and divorced in October 1971. He 
married a second woman in January 1972 and was divorced from her in July 1976. Applicant and his wife have lived in the same residence since October 1977. 
He has a bachelor of arts degree in political science.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used cocaine on three occasions - once in 1969, once in 1981, and once in 1985. He also used mescaline on two occasions between 1968 and 1969. 
He first used marijuana in approximately 1968 while attending college. He used marijuana about once a month until 1976. For about 18 months beginning in 
1975, he used marijuana more frequently, about once a week, while residing with a friend who sold marijuana. He continued using marijuana approximately 
once a month from 1976 to 1994. He has purchased marijuana for his personal use on a number of occasions, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to grow marijuana 
in his backyard in 1974/75.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's marijuana use included several occasions in approximately 1974 when he used the drug during lunch breaks while working for his present 
employer. His use of marijuana following his graduation from college generally occurred when he attended professional baseball games with a friend. He 
discontinued using marijuana for a short period in 1988 after becoming more religiously involved, but resumed use after about one year. He had a severe 
adverse physical reaction to marijuana after smoking it at a baseball game in 1994 and has not used it since. He convincingly testified that his life has changed 
since then and he will not use any illegal controlled substance in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on February 3, 2000, that was signed by him on February 8, 2000, in which he answered "No" to 
question 28: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Use in Sensitive Positions - Have you EVER illegally used a controlled substance while employed as 
a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and immediately affecting 
public safety? </EM>He was issued a security clearance in 1986, continued to use marijuana until 1994, and, accordingly, that answer was incorrect. However, in that 
same SF 86 Applicant admitted he used marijuana on 10 occasions between January 1993 and July 1994 in response to question 27.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He also disclosed he had 
possessed a secret security clearance since May 1983 in response to question 31.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The net effect of the answers Applicant provided in response to questions 27 and 31 was to acknowledge he had used marijuana while possessing a security 
clearance, despite his denial in response to question 28. The only explanation Applicant could provide for the discrepant answers was that he must have 
misunderstood the question. Considering his appearance, demeanor, and manner while testifying, the answers he gave to questions 27 and 31, and the 
potentially confusing structure of question 28,<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> I find his explanation that he misunderstood the question credible. I also find his admission to the allegation 
contained in SOR subparagraph 2.a. was improvident due to his failure to give proper consideration to the necessity that the falsification be deliberate to 
constitute a Guideline E disqualifying condition.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline E, 
pertaining to personal conduct, and H, pertaining to drug involvement, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="01-26060.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H, illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law.  Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not.  
If they do not respect the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used marijuana on a regular basis from the time he was in college in 1968/69 until 1994. He also used cocaine on three occasions, the last use 
occurring in 1985. He has purchased marijuana for his own use and attempted to grow marijuana plants in his backyard. He possessed a secret security 
clearance on one of the occasions when he used cocaine and on multiple occasions when he used marijuana. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse</EM>; 
and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution </EM>apply in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not used any illegal controlled substance since 1994. He convincingly testified he will not use illegal controlled substances in the future and bases 
that, at least in part, on  religious changes that have occurred in his life. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A 
demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM> apply in this case. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, 
the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find 
Applicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline H. Guideline H is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. Although 
Applicant provided an incorrect answer to question 28 in the SF 86 he submitted, he did not deliberately falsify the application. I do not find any Guideline E 
disqualifying condition applies in this case. Guideline E is decided for Applicant</SPAN></P>
