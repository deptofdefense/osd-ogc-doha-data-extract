<P>Applicant began using marijuana in about September 1992 while he held a secret security clearance for his work as a student researcher at a university-affiliated 
research laboratory. He  continued to smoke marijuana on average twice per year until approximately August 2002. After being interviewed for his continued 
suitability for access to classified information, Applicant realized drug use could negatively jeopardize his clearance so he resolved to abstain in the future. 
Applicant has been drug free since and intends no future involvement. While there is little risk of future drug use, his disregard of the laws pertaining to illegal 
drug use reflects extremely poor judgment. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 10, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="03-05072.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> DOHA recommended referral to an administrative judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should 
be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The SOR was based on drug involvement (Guideline H) and personal conduct (Guideline E) because of marijuana 
use from 1992 until at least summer 2002. The Government also alleged Applicant is statutorily disqualified from having his clearance renewed under 10 
U.S.C. &sect; 986, citing his intent to continue to use marijuana once or twice per year.</P> 
<P>On October 17, 2003, Applicant, acting <EM>pro se</EM>, filed his response to the SOR allegations and requested a determination without a hearing. On December 8, 
2003, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 22, 
2004. Pursuant to formal notice dated March 23, 2004, a hearing was scheduled for April 22, 2004. At the hearing held as scheduled, the Government submitted 
two exhibits: Applicant's November 2001 security clearance application and a sworn statement executed before the Defense Security Service (DSS) on 
November 21, 2002. Applicant's case consisted of one exhibit, the DSS report of its investigation of Applicant in 2003, and testimony from two witnesses (the 
director of the university research foundation employing Applicant and Applicant's wife) in addition to his own. A transcript of the proceeding was received on 
ay 5, 2004.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Government alleged as security disqualifying that Applicant used marijuana approximately twice a year while possessing a secret clearance from 1992 to at 
least summer 2002,<A HREF="03-05072.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> purchased marijuana on at least one occasion for $10, and intended to use marijuana in the future once or twice a year. Because of this 
intent to continue use, the Government also alleged Applicant was disqualified from having his clearance renewed under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 that prohibits the 
Department of Defense from granting or renewing a security clearance to a Department of Defense contractor employee who "is an unlawful user of, or is 
addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802))." In his Answer, Applicant admitted he had 
used marijuana occasionally between 1992 and 2002, but had completely discontinued involvement since his interview with the DSS agent. Applicant admitted 
he had paid for marijuana only on the one occasion alleged. He denied any intent to use marijuana in the future, as he realized following his DSS interview that 
it would not be in his best interest to continue marijuana use, and had stated during his interview that he would consider stopping marijuana and discarding the 
marijuana he had in his home if it might cause him to lose his clearance. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old laser scientist employed full-time at a research foundation since August 1994. He had worked at the university-affiliated research 
facility as an undergraduate student and was initially granted a confidential security clearance in August 1989. He has held a secret-level clearance since April 
1991, and is required to maintain that clearance for his continued employment.</P> 
<P>While still in high school, Applicant began designing and building a carbon dioxide laser system. Directed to the local university for information, Applicant 
was hired the summer after he graduated to work at the laser research laboratory affiliated with the institution. That fall, Applicant commenced his 
undergraduate studies in chemistry at the university. He continued to work as a student technician researcher at the laboratory and was granted a confidential-level security clearance for his duties. His clearance was upgraded to secret in April 1991. In about September 1992, during his junior year, and while he held a 
secret-level clearance for his student duties at the laboratory,<A HREF="03-05072.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant began to use marijuana on limited social occasions, enjoying its euphoric and relaxing 
effects. During his last two years of college, he shared a marijuana cigarette with friends on eight to ten occasions. While Applicant was aware of the illegality 
of marijuana use,  he did not consider his off-duty social use in his home or in the homes of friends or family to pose a risk to security.</P> 
<P>On earning his degree, he was hired on full-time as a scientist at the research laboratory in August 1994. He used marijuana thereafter on a "handful" of 
occasions, including twice in 1996 with his then roommate. In June 1997, Applicant married his girlfriend, who he had known since high school and been 
dating since his junior year in college. Before a camping trip with another couple in about August 1997, Applicant and spouse baked brownies laced with 
marijuana that they ingested on the camping trip. Neither Applicant nor his spouse now recalls whose idea it was to bake the brownies or who transported them 
to the campsite. The marijuana was obtained from her brother.</P> 
<P>Applicant smoked marijuana with his spouse on one occasion thereafter, in July 2001 at his spouse's family's beach house. Her brother, who was present and 
used as well, provided the drug. Applicant's spouse has not used marijuana since.</P> 
<P>In conjunction with a periodic reinvestigation of his clearance suitability, Applicant executed a security clearance application (SF 86) on November 8, 2001. 
Applicant responded affirmatively to inquiries into any illegal drug involvement in the last 7 years and any use ever while in a sensitive position (including 
while possessing a security clearance) and indicated he used marijuana approximately 15 times from September 1, 1991 to July 1, 2001.<A HREF="03-05072.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In about August 2002, Applicant smoked marijuana with his brother-in-law in Applicant's new condominium. Applicant's  spouse was present but did not use 
marijuana on that occasion.</P> 
<P>On November 21, 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a DSS special agent concerning his illegal drug use. Applicant related his involvement with marijuana 
began in approximately 1992, after he had been granted his secret clearance in 1991. He described limited use approximately twice per year with friends, his 
wife, and his wife's family at social gatherings with a most recent use about three months before the interview. Applicant admitted he had a very small quantity 
of marijuana in his home that he maintained was not enough to roll one cigarette and over one year old. He expressed his intent to limit his use of illegal 
substances in the future to marijuana once or twice per year. He also expressed a willingness to consider ceasing his use of marijuana and discarding the small 
amount that was in his home "if it might cause [him] to lose [his] security clearance." By the end of the interview, Applicant was concerned that his use of 
marijuana while holding a security clearance was a problem for the Department of Defense. After executing a sworn statement reflecting his drug use and 
intentions,  Applicant informed the DSS agent that he intended to return home that evening and destroy the marijuana he had stored there.</P> 
<P>At the end of the work day on November 21, 2002, Applicant informed his spouse that he could not smoke marijuana in the future. They both resolved to 
abstain from any future drug involvement, and Applicant flushed down the sink the marijuana that had been in his kitchen cabinet. The marijuana in his 
possession had been left by his brother-in-law and was not purchased by Applicant.</P> 
<P>Applicant told the DSS agent in November 2002 that he could recall paying a friend $10 on one occasion in exchange for a small baggie of marijuana. At his 
hearing, he testified this "friend" was his brother-in-law to whom he had given the $10 "as an offering" since he had never paid him in any way for the 
marijuana used in the past. He characterized it as "[his] turn to buy a round of drinks, that sort of thing." Applicant subsequently testified to having no recall of 
receiving a small baggie of marijuana in exchange for the money, but guessed he gave his brother-in-law the $10 with the assumption it was being used toward 
marijuana. Applicant had better recall when it came to whether he had paid his brother-in-law for the marijuana kept in his kitchen cabinet until November 
2002, flatly denying any purchase of that marijuana. Based on the record evidence, I find Applicant gave his brother-in-law $10 for marijuana sometime in 2001 
or before in exchange for a small quantity of the drug.</P> 
<P>As of April 2004, Applicant and his spouse had limited personal contact (a couple of times per year) with her brother who had relocated to another state. They 
do not knowingly associate with individuals who use illegal drugs.</P> 
<P>The director of the laboratory employing Applicant considers him to be an "ideal employee." Applicant has proven to be a very talented, dedicated worker, 
careful with classified documents. With only 12 full-time staff members and their program being the only classified program in the university system, security 
briefings have been infrequent.  Neither Applicant nor the laboratory's director was specifically apprised of the Department of Defense's policy against drug 
use.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information." Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for 
a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability. <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</P> 
<P>Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</P> 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Concern:</P> 
<P>a. Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or 
dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information. (E2.A8.1.1.1.)</P> 
<P>b. Drugs are defined as mood and behavior-altering substances, and include: (E2.A8.1.1.2.)</P> 
<P>(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) (E2.A8.1.1.2.1.), and</P> 
<P>c. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction. (E2.A8.1.1.3)</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>a. Any drug abuse (see above definition); (E.2.A8.1.2.1.)</P> 
<P>b. Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution. (E2.A8.1.2.2.)</P> 
<P>e. Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result 
in an unfavorable determination. (E2.A8.1.2.5)</P> 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
<P>a. The drug involvement is not recent; (E2.A8.1.3.1.)</P> 
<P>b. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. (E2.A8.1.3.3.)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.1. The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . ;</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.6. Association with persons involved in criminal activity.</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.3.7. Association with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the Government established its case with respect to Guideline H, drug involvement, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant used marijuana on 
about 16 occasions while he held a secret clearance and position of trust with the Government. Introduced to marijuana in college, he continued to use 
marijuana, albeit infrequently, after he began working full-time as a scientist at the laboratory in August 1994. On at least one occasion, he and his spouse 
baked brownies containing marijuana and then ingested them on a camping trip with another couple. He also gave his brother-in-law $10 for marijuana at least 
once, and had possession of a small quantity of marijuana in his residence as of November 2002. Disqualifying conditions a. Any drug abuse, and b. Illegal drug 
possession, of guideline H must be considered in determining Applicant's security suitability.</P> 
<P>Although he was not a frequent user of marijuana, Applicant clearly enjoyed the drug's relaxing effects. When interviewed by a DSS agent in November 2002, 
Applicant indicated it was "fun" to use marijuana socially on occasion. He also expressed an intent to use marijuana on a limited basis (once or twice per year) 
in the future, but would consider ceasing entirely should it cost him his clearance. Based on this stated intent, the Government alleged Applicant was ineligible 
for clearance renewal under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(2), which prohibits the Department of Defense from granting or renewing a security clearance to certain 
categories of persons, including defense contractor employees, who are "an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in section 102 
of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802)). While the statute provides that the Secretary of Defense (or secretary of the relevant military department) 
may, in a meritorious case, authorize an exception to the statutory prohibition for persons in two statutory categories, an exception is not authorized for persons 
falling under paragraph (2) of &sect; 986(c).</P> 
<P>In the implementation guidance issued June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense indicated this statute did not change the substance of guideline H, the 
adjudicative guideline for drug involvement. The official policy guidance is as follows: "Anyone who is currently an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a 
controlled substance is not considered eligible for a security clearance."<A HREF="03-05072.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> There is no evidence in this case that Applicant was ever physiologically addicted to 
marijuana. There is no evidence that he used marijuana in the year preceding the SOR. Most important, he resolved as of November 2002 to cease his 
involvement with illicit drugs. With a last use of illegal drugs in about August 2002, and a credible intent to abstain in the future, there is no basis to conclude 
he is a current drug user. Paragraph 2. of the SOR is therefore found for Applicant.</P> 
<P>Although 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 does not  bar Applicant from being granted a clearance, he  bears a particularly heavy burden to overcome the doubts for his security 
worthiness engendered by his use of marijuana while in position of trust with the Government (<EM>see</EM> DC e. Recent drug involvement, especially following the 
granting of a security clearance . . . will almost invariably result in an unfavorable determination). Applicant's use of marijuana in college can be attributed to 
his youth and the environment. The grant of a security clearance does not necessarily immunize one from the irresponsible decisions that college students make 
when free of parental oversight. His use of marijuana after he began full-time employment at the laboratory is more troubling, but he has been free of drugs 
since August 2002 and intends not to use any illegal drug in the future. Even though he executed a sworn statement for the DSS expressing an intent to continue 
to use marijuana once or twice per year, he qualified it and indicated he was willing to give up marijuana if it might cause him to lose his clearance.  As 
reported by the DSS agent, Applicant told him at the conclusion of the interview that because of their discussion, he intended to return home that evening and 
destroy the marijuana he had there. His spouse corroborates that Applicant flushed the marijuana down the sink and they have both resolved to abstain from any 
future involvement with illegal drugs. As of his hearing in April 2004, Applicant's contact with his brother-in-law, who provided him the marijuana in recent 
years, was limited to a couple of times per year at the holidays. Based on the record before me, I conclude there is little risk, if any, of future drug abuse. 
Accordingly, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. are resolved in Applicant's favor.</P> 
<P>Conceding Applicant's change to a drug-free lifestyle,<A HREF="03-05072.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Department Counsel continued to press for revocation of Applicant's security clearance under Guideline 
E, personal conduct, based on the fact that Applicant used marijuana while he held a security clearance. Acknowledging that Applicant and the laboratory 
director both testified to never being briefed on the implications of using marijuana with a clearance, Department Counsel submits it is common sense to 
recognize that illegal behavior is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. Disregard of a known law while holding a clearance would raise guideline E 
concerns (<EM>see</EM> E2.A5.1.2.5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations). Whether or not Applicant was specifically apprised of the Department of Defense policy, 
he clearly knew his use of marijuana was illegal. The fact that Applicant did not personally consider his use of marijuana to rise to the level of serious criminal 
conduct does not mitigate his poor judgment in using marijuana while he had a clearance, including on one occasion after he completed his SF 86 for renewal 
of his clearance.</P> 
<P>Security clearance determinations involve a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept. (<EM>See</EM> E2.2.1.) To Applicant's credit, 
he was candid with the Department of Defense about his marijuana involvement when he completed his SF 86. He also provided significant detail about his 
drug involvement when interviewed by the DSS agent, admitting an intent to continue his limited use in the future unless it might cost him his clearance. Yet 
his testimony at his hearing was not completely consistent with his prior disclosures. Applicant had told the DSS agent that he had paid a friend $10 for a small 
baggie of marijuana on one occasion. At his hearing, he claimed to have no recall of receiving marijuana in exchange for the money, and testified he gave his 
brother-in-law the $10 to be "nice" since he had been provided marijuana free of charge in the past. Applicant's inability to recall the circumstances of his one-time expenditure of money for marijuana is suspect. As evidenced by the following exchange between the undersigned and Applicant, he was reluctant at the 
hearing to admit to conduct that could raise questions about his judgment and reliability:</P> 
<P>Q And marijuana was illegal. Why did you choose marijuana over alcohol?</P> 
<P>A I was more, to try it.</P> 
<P>Q To try it?</P> 
<P>A To see what it was all about.</P> 
<P>Q All right, well that could explain the first couple of times but why did you continue to use it?</P> 
<P>A It's relaxing, I guess.</P> 
<P>Q Okay. Now, with respect to the amount that you had in your residence, and you destroyed after the DSS interview, apparently [it] was in the back of some 
drawer somewhere.</P> 
<P>A Right.</P> 
<P>Q In the kitchen?</P> 
<P>A Right.</P> 
<P>Q Right. You knew, you obviously knew it was there if, when you got back from the DSS interview, you knew to get it to destroy it, right?</P> 
<P>A Right.</P> 
<P>Q Why were you keeping it?</P> 
<P>A No idea.</P> 
<P>Q You have no idea why you kept it?</P> 
<P>A I really don't.</P> 
<P>Q So, would I be wrong to infer that you might have used it, you intended to use it at some point?</P> 
<P>A I guess you would infer that. It sounds really bad though.(Tr. 79-80).</P> 
<P>While it is credible that he might not recall all the details of his drug use, his testimony regarding the marijuana-laced brownies was also sufficiently sketchy to 
call into question his trustworthiness, despite his earlier candor with the Government. He was able to recall that his camping companions were his spouse's 
coworker and her husband but not who transported the brownies or whose idea it was to lace the brownies with marijuana. Despite his change to a drug-free 
lifestyle, doubts persist as to whether he possesses the requisite good judgment that must be demanded of those with access. Subparagraph 3.a. is resolved 
against him.</P>
