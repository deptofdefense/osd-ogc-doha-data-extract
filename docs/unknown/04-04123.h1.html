<P>The Applicant's brother, sister and sister-in-law are citizens of and reside in Pakistan.  All three have applied for and will soon emigrate to the U.S.  His brother 
is a businessman.  His brother held a local government position in the late 1990s, but has held no such position since then.  The Applicant's sister and sister-in-law are housewives.  In the last 24 years, the Applicant has given his foreign relatives a total of about $70,000.  He recently deeded away property worth 
between $20,000 and $30,000 to his brother.  The Applicant's net worth in the U.S. is between $3,000,000 and $5,000,000.  The Applicant's foreign relatives 
are not connected to any foreign government, and are not subject to coercion.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 15, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about November 4, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on January 14, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on January 20, 2005, and the case was heard on February 16, 
2005.  The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called two witnesses to testify on his behalf.  The 
transcript was received on February 28, 2005.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Influence militates against the granting of a 
security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">47 years of age, and is the 
President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant came from Pakistan in 1980 (Transcript (TR) at page 24 at line 23 to page 25 line 3).  He became a naturalized citizen in 1991 (TR at page 28 
lines 10~13, and Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 1).  In 2000, the Applicant formed his own company, of which he is the President and CEO (TR at page 4 
line 22 to page 5 line 1, and at page 29 lines 3~8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. and 1.d.  The Applicant's brother is a citizen of and resides in Pakistan (TR at page 45 line 15 to page 48 line 2).  His brother was elected to a local 
government position in 1996 or 1997, but that position was "dissolved" in 1998 with a change in the national regime (TR at page 48 lines 2~16, and at page 70 
line 25 to page 72 line 1).  The Applicant's brother runs "a lumber and steel business" (TR at page 49 lines 3~9).  This brother is not a target for coercion; but 
should such a situation arise, the Applicant would report it to his security officer (TR at page 48 line 22 to page 49 line 2, and at page 63 line 19 to page 65 line 
9).  The Applicant's brother has applied to emigrate to the U.S., which should occur in 2005 (TR at page 78 lines 1~7, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) D at 
enclosure 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant's sister is a citizen of and resides in Pakistan (TR at page 49 line 14 to page 50 lines 14~18).  She is a housewife (<EM>Id</EM>).  The Applicant's 
sister has also applied to emigrate to the U.S. (TR at page 50 lines 12~14, and AppX D at enclosure 2).  She is not a target for coercion, and the Applicant 
would report such an attempt to his security officer (TR at page 63 line 19 to page 65 line 9).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant's sister-in-law is a citizen of and resides in Pakistan (TR at page 50 line 15 to page 51 line 3).  She is also a housewife (<EM>Id</EM>).  The 
Applicant's sister-in-law has applied to emigrate to the U.S. (TR at page 50 lines 12~14, and AppX D at enclosure 3).  She is not a target for coercion, and the 
Applicant would report such an attempt to his security officer (TR at page 63 line 19 to page 65 line 9).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.~1.h.  The Applicant is in weekly telephone contact with his brother and sister (TR at page 51 line 20 to page 52 line 17).  The subject of the Applicant's 
employment has never been a part of their conversations (<EM>Id</EM>).  Over the last 24 years, the Applicant has provided monetary gifts totaling about $70,000 to his 
before mentioned relatives (TR at page 52 line 18 to page 53 line 23, and at page 70 lines 17~24).  The Applicant's net worth in the U.S. is between $3,000,000 
and $5,000,000 (TR at page 56 lines 19~22, <EM>see also</EM> AppX B).  He has recently transferred property worth between $20,000 and $30,000 to his brother to avoid 
having any foreign financial interests (TR at page 53 to page 55 line 9).  The Applicant traveled to Pakistan to visit his family in 1987 or 1988, 1992 and 1998 
(TR at page 56 line 23 to page 59 line 3, and at page 78 lines 8~19).  He plans no further trips to Pakistan, as his family members will all soon emigrate to the 
U.S. (<EM>Id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His contemporaries in the defense sector and in his industry think most highly of the Applicant (TR at page 80 line 4 to page 85 line 25, at page 87 line 5 to 
page 96 line 22, and AppX D at enclosure 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1991, he renounced his Pakistani citizenship.  He founded his own company, which contributes to the defense 
sector, and has established a personal net worth of between $3,000,000 and $5,000,000.  He has thus realized the American dream by contributing his talents to 
his adopted land, and at the same time establishing personal wealth.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's brother, sister and sister-in-law, however, are citizens of and live in Pakistan.  The second disqualifying condition under Foreign Influence is 
therefore applicable as "[a]n immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country."  All of these subject relations are awaiting the issuance of their 
green cards and will soon thereafter emigrate to the U.S.  Furthermore, none of the Applicant's immediate family are presently connected with any government, 
and there is no evidence that their presence in Pakistan can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the Applicant 
would even consider any such attempt at exploitation.  The first mitigation condition is therefore applicable as "the immediate family members . . . are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has no financial interests in Pakistan, and his telephonic contacts with his family will end with their pending immigration.  Furthermore, he plans 
no further trips to the country of his birth.  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline B is found in the Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his alleged foreign influence.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
