<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 17, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security 
concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators 
could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A>On June

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions </SPAN>are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, 
Applicant's testimony, and the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 38-year-old computer systems engineer. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since July 2006. (Tr. 24) Applicant was 
born in Ethiopia. He moved to the U.S. with his older brother in 1985, at age 16. (Tr. 80-82, 168) His father sent them both to the United States because he 
was concerned that the then communist government of Ethiopia would take them out of school and force them to serve in the Ethiopian armed forces. (Tr. 
146-147) Applicant moved in with his uncle who sponsored him into the United States under a student visa. He attended high school and college in the United 
States, and obtained a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1991. </P> 
 
<P>After graduation, from approximately 1991 to 1996, he continued his practical training working for a couple of computer companies. (Tr. 82-96) In 1996, 
Applicant, two of his brothers, and a cousin established a computer sales company. He was a part owner in the business and worked as network engineer and 
sales representative. From February 2001 to December 2002, he was self-employed in his own consulting company. His business did not do well and from 2002 
to 2005, he was employed by a defense contractor doing networking and computer security. While working for this company, he submitted his security 
clearance application.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> From 2005 to 2006, he worked for another defense contractor doing computer security analysis and protection. Although he did well 
and received certificates of appreciation and commendation for his good job performance, he was terminated because he lacked a security clearance. In 2006, 
he began working for his current employer, a defense contractor, performing computer security analysis. He requires access to classified information to keep 
his job. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has completed extensive computer security training, including certified courses by excellent companies.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> During his last three jobs with defense 
contractors, he received yearly training in the handling of classified information as well as contractor's proprietary information. According to his three character 
witnesses' testimony, Applicant has a reputation for always complying with the rules for handling classified and/or proprietary information. (Tr. 21-67) They all 
worked closely with Applicant and supervised him directly for approximately two years, one and one-half year, and eight months respectively. Applicant is 
characterized as an excellent employee, reliable, dependable, honest, and trustworthy. In their opinion, Applicant is loyal to the United States, and always took 
the initiative to follow the companies' security rules and procedures. There is no evidence he has ever compromised or caused the compromise of protected 
information. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, his wife, and all of their immediate and extended family members were born in Ethiopia, with the exception of his six-year-old son who was born in 
the United States.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen in March 2003. He met his wife in the United States and they were married in 1998. 
His wife attended college in the United States and works for an airline as a ticket agent. She submitted her naturalization application in May 2006, and they 
expect she will be sworn in as a United States citizen in 2007.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> She last traveled to Ethiopia in 2004 and 2005 to visit with relatives and attend a cousins' 
weddings. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father (68 years old) and his mother (61 years old) are permanent resident aliens of the United States. (Tr. 99-111)  According to Applicant, they 
live in the United States approximately six months of each year and in Ethiopia the remainder of the year. His mother owns a fashion store and his father owns 
a computer retail store in Ethiopia. They frequently travel to the United States to purchase merchandise for their respective businesses and to visit their 
immediate and extended family living in the United States. Whenever they come to the United States, they stay with their sons or daughters. Applicant's 
mother would like to become a United States citizen. (Tr. 106) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has five siblings all of whom were born in Ethiopia. (Tr. 113-120) Three of his siblings are naturalized American citizens residing in the United 
States. Two of his siblings are Ethiopian citizens residing in the United States. One of them is in the process of applying for permanent residency, the other is in 
the United States under a student visa, but would also like to become a United States citizen.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant claimed he only communicates with his mother while she is in the United States. Since approximately 18 months ago, he has had limited contact with 
his father because of family disagreements. He averred having little of no contact with the rest of his extended family living in Ethiopia. He only communicates 
with them during special circumstances such as the death of a family member. (Tr. 169)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother-in-law is an Ethiopian citizen living in the United States as a permanent resident alien. (Tr. 124-129) His wife has nine siblings, three 
brothers and six sisters. One brother and a sister are citizens and residents of Canada (occupation unknown). Two brothers (a taxi driver and an owner of a 
small electronics repair shop, respectively) and two sisters (one imports women's clothing the other sister's occupation is unknown) are citizens and residents 
of Ethiopia. Three of the sisters are permanent resident aliens in the United States.  One of them has applied for American citizenship.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Additionally, Applicant has approximately 30 other extended family members (uncles, aunts, cousins) residing in the United States with whom he has frequent 
contacts. He has a similar number of extended family members who are citizens and residents of Ethiopia with whom Applicant claimed he has infrequent to no 
contact. (Tr. 140)</P> 
 
<P>To his, or to his wife's knowledge, none of his or his wife's immediate family members have ever been associated/involved with the Ethiopian government or 
its military forces. They claimed their immediate family members are apolitical and have not had any runs-ins with Ethiopian authorities. He stated that his 
immediate family members are financially self-sufficient and he does not provide (or receive) financial assistance to (from) any of his relatives. He only provides 
financial assistance (approximately $3,000 a year) to his youngest brother who is attending college in the United States.</P> 
 
<P>From 1997 to 2002, Applicant traveled between seven and ten times to Ethiopia to assist his father with setting up a computer retail store in that country. (Tr. 
148-155) Around 1997, he and two of his brothers and a cousin established a computer retail store in the United States. Their company in the United States 
supplied his father's business with used computer parts and equipment. Additionally, he unsuccessfully tried to establish his own computer business in Ethiopia. 
After his business failure, Applicant became disenchanted with the bureaucracy and limited business opportunities in Ethiopia. He decided to pursue his 
American dream and become a United States citizen. He testified that during his trips he was never approached or questioned by Ethiopian authorities. He 
never had any trouble entering or leaving the country, and he was never approached by anyone seeking information concerning the United States. He last 
traveled to Ethiopia twice in 2002 before becoming a United States citizen, and he has no intentions to travel to Ethiopia ever again. (Tr. 161) Applicant 
claimed he no longer owns any interest in his brother's computer business.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant said that because of his extensive security training, if he was ever approached by anyone asking for information about the United States, or if any 
pressure was ever placed on his family or him for such information, he would report such incident to the United States authorities. (Tr. 133) He knew as an 
individual he was powerless to resolve such incidents and his best course of action was to request the United States government assistance to deal with the 
problem.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant had no financial interests or property in Ethiopia. On the other hand, he testified he has substantial financial interests in the United States that include: 
a residence with an estimated value of $520,000 in which he has a $50,000 equity; an investment real state property he owns in partnership with two of his 
brothers and a second cousin with an estimated value of $1.3 million (their equity in the property is 30% of its value, of which he owns 25%); and four other 
residential real state properties with an estimated equity of $220,000. He also had liquid assets totaling $100,000. (Tr. 137-140)</P> 
 
<P>Ethiopia is a developing country with a democratic federal republic form of government.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Since the late 1970s, the United States has provided substantial 
military and economic assistance to Ethiopia. The two countries have had diplomatic relations since 1992. The relations between the countries is considered 
good, especially in responding to regional instability, supporting the war on terrorism, and economic development. Ethiopia has devoted high-level attention to 
the fight against terrorism, and has a continuous counterterrorism cooperation with the United States. The country does not provide sanctuary or offer political 
or financial support to any terrorist group, and in recent years there have been no significant terrorist incidents directed against U.S. citizens in Ethiopia. The 
government's human rights record is considered poor, although improving. Members of its security forces committed serious human rights abuses, including 
unlawful killings, alleged political killings, torture of detainees, arbitrary arrest and searches (particularly of those suspected of sympathizing with terrorist 
organizations), and in general, abused individuals' civil and privacy rights.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline B, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a "security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure." Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">One of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could raise a security concern in this case. FI DC 1 applies where an "immediate family 
member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country." Directive &para; 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> "Immediate family members" include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. Applicant's father, 
mother, and brother are "immediate family members." The government produced substantial evidence to establish FI DC 1 because Applicant's parents, some 
of his siblings, his mother-in-law, and some of his wife's siblings are Ethiopian citizens. Some of them live in Ethiopia, others in the United States. He has close 
ties of affection or obligation to them.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In every security clearance case an applicant's ties or connections to any foreign country require careful examination.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Although, the mere possession of close 
family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an 
applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise 
of classified information.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">has close ties of affection or obligation with his parents, siblings, mother-in-law, and wife's siblings. His parents are citizens of, and reside 
approximately half of the year in Ethiopia. Two of his siblings, his mother-in-law, and three of his wife's siblings are citizens of Ethiopia and reside in the 
United States. <A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The strength of his familial relationships is demonstrated by his travel to Ethiopia from 1997 to 2002, his wife's travel to Ethiopia in 2004-2005, and the financial support provided to his sibling as well as their business relationship. The fact that Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation to 
persons who are either citizens or residents of Ethiopia is sufficient to raise security concerns concerning the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure by a foreign country.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because FI DCs 1 applies, Applicant has the burden to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing the applicability of one or more foreign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC). FI 
C 1 recognizes that security concerns are reduced when there is "[a] determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States." Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. The Appeal Board has 
decided that Applicant must prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are not agents of a foreign power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> are not in a position to be exploited 
by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Applicant satisfies the first prong of 
FI MC 1 because none of his or his wife's immediate family members are "agents of a foreign power"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> under the Appeal Board's definition.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the "associate(s) in question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States." The Appeal Board interprets this 
language as establishing a strict standard; i.e., an applicant must affirmatively prove that there is <EM>no possibility </EM>that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence 
a foreign relative or acquaintance in the future.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In deciding whether Applicant's family members are in a position to be exploited, I considered Ethiopia's form of government.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Ethiopia and the United 
States have a cooperative relationship as demonstrated by their diplomatic status, the military and financial assistance/support provided by United States to 
Ethiopia, and Ethiopia's continued cooperation with the United States in the war against terrorism. There is no evidence the government of Ethiopia has 
engaged in any type of espionage against the United States. I took note of Ethiopia's poor human rights record. Although, there is little indication of targeting, 
or of violation of human/civil rights by the government against Ethiopian citizens who have become United States citizens, the potential still exists. To a certain 
extent, the security concerns raised by Ethiopia are less than those raised by a country hostile to the U.S. Nevertheless, the concerns still exist, because even 
friendly countries have interests that are contrary to the national interest of the U.S. Thus, FI MC 1 cannot be applied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">FI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where "contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent." Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3. 
Applicant has frequent contacts when his parents visit his family in the United States. Applicant also failed to establish that his wife's contacts with her siblings 
in Ethiopia are casual.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> I conclude that FI MC 3 cannot be applied. Although Applicant does not have any financial interests in Ethiopia, this fact does not 
mitigate the foreign influence concerns based on FI DC 1 or 3</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.<A HREF="06-06455.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I conclude that no Guideline B Mitigating Conditions apply, and I expressly and specifically

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following facts and circumstances. Applicant arrived in the United States at a young age and completed 
his high school and college education in the United States. He and his siblings have embraced the "American dream," working hard to establish businesses' 
opportunities and investments in the United States. He appears to be doing quite well with substantial financial interest solely in the United States. Most of 
Applicant's immediate family members reside in the United States. His parents have freely traveled for years between the two Countries without raising the 
concerns or interest of the Ethiopian authorities. His immediate family members residing in Ethiopia are not agents of a foreign country, are apolitical, and have 
not had runs-ins with Ethiopian authorities. Their occupations are such that it is not likely they would create any attention to themselves or Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">His parents, most of his siblings, his wife, and some of her siblings are permanent residents of the United States, and in the process of applying for citizenship. 
Applicant credibly testified his and his family's home is in the United States, and that he has no intentions of going back to Ethiopia. Applicant's past work 
history and reputation shows he is dependable, reliable and trustworthy. More important, he has established a reputation for being conscientious of and for 
follows security rules and regulations. Additionally, Ethiopia's government relations with the United States, its posture towards terrorism, its behavior toward 
American citizens, and the absence of a history of espionage against the United States makes it less likely that Applicant would be forced to choose between his 
loyalty to his family and the United States. Based on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant's immediately family members in Ethiopia do not pose an 
unacceptable security risk or concern for foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. 
I also applied the whole person concept. Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, I find Applicant has mitigated the 
foreign influence security concerns. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Formal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are as follows:</SPAN></P>

Applicant. Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P>
