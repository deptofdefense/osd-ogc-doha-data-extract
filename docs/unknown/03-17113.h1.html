<P>Applicant's sister is a U.S. citizen residing in Macau, a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China.  His father is a citizen resident of 
Hong Kong.  Applicant's in-laws are citizen residents of Taiwan.  Applicant failed to document on his security clearance application his travels outside the U.S. 
He failed to mitigate foreign influence and personal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA issued<A HREF="03-17113.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> a Statement of 
Reasons<A HREF="03-17113.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the 
Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 5 March 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me 
on 15 July 2004.  On 8 September 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 17 September 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is a 42-year-old advisory systems engineer for a defense contractor.  Applicant obtained a security clearance in 1986 when he worked in the applied 
physics laboratory of a university.  After starting work with his present employer in 2000, he obtained an interim clearance that was suspended when the SOR 
was issued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant was born in Macau, which was then a colony of Portugal and is now a Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  In 
1978, Applicant's mother divorced his father and moved to the U.S. with Applicant.  Applicant was 16 years old at the time.  He completed high school and 
college in the U.S. and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1985.  Ex. 1 at 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Taiwan.  Her parents are citizen residents of Taiwan.  Applicant has visited his in-laws once 
since his marriage in 1986.  His wife stays in touch with her parents.  Applicant's mother, father, and stepfather were born in what is now the PRC.  His father 
is a retired watchman who is a citizen resident of Hong Kong.  Ex. A.  Applicant saw his father on one of his trips to Macau.  Applicant's mother and stepfather 
are naturalized U.S. citizens.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant has one sister, one half-sister, and one brother.  Ex. 3 at 4.  The half-sister was born in the U.S.  His brother and sister were born in Macau.  The 
brother is a citizen of Macau, but lives in the U.S.  The sister was born in Hong Kong, is a naturalized citizen of the U.S., but has been a resident of Macau for 
30 years.  Ex. B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant has traveled to Macau to visit his sister once a year, the last time in early in 2004.  During these visits, he went to Shanghai, in the PRC, for a week, 
and visited another city in the PRC for dinner.  He used a Macau residency card, apparently provided to him when he was a resident of Macau, to cross the 
border into the PRC.  Applicant also has a Macau driver's license.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Macau is a 13 square mile enclave on the south China coast approximately 40 miles west of 
Hong Kong.  It reverted from Portuguese to PRC control on 20 December 1999.  Macau enjoys considerable autonomy except in defense and foreign affairs.  
acau's citizens should enjoy this autonomy until 2049 and the economic system and way of life are to remain unchanged until then.  Citizens have basic 
freedoms and the government respects basic human rights of its citizens.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant signed his security clearance applications (SCAs) on 6 September 2000 and 6 November 2003, certifying the information contained therein was "true, 
complete, and correct to the best of [his] knowledge and belief," and acknowledging that a "knowing and willful false statement" could be punished under 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Question 16 asked if Applicant "had traveled outside the Untied States on other than on official U.S. Government orders in the past 7 years."  
He was not to repeat travel covered in other questions.  Applicant answered "no" to this question on both SCAs.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's father is a citizen of Hong Kong residing in Macau (&para; 1.a); his sister is a U.S. citizen residing in Macau (&para; 1.b); his in-laws are citizen residents of Taiwan (&para; 1.c); he traveled to Macau three or four times between January 1998 and December 1999 and resided with his sister (&para; 
1.d); he traveled to the PRC (&para; 1.e), and he traveled to Hong Kong to visit his father who resides in Macau (&para; 1.f).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an 
applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to 
duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant has immediate family members--his father and sister--and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

foreign power and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to her family 
members and loyalty to the U.S.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, it is important to consider the totality of an applicant's family ties in a foreign country,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has cautioned against "overly simplistic distinctions between 'friendly' nations and 'hostile' nations" when deciding foreign influence cases.  
ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Relations between nations often change, even friendly nations may 
have "profound disagreements" with the U.S. over some issues affecting their national security, and not all cases of espionage against the U.S. involve nations 
hostile to the U.S.  <EM>Id.</EM>  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or 
country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United 
States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is clearly close to his sister who, although a U.S. citizen, has resided and worked in Macau for the past 30 years.  They are close, as demonstrated by 
his annual trips to visit her.  Although his personal contact with his in-laws is not great, Applicant failed to overcome the presumption that a person has ties of 
affection or at least obligation to the immediate family members of his spouse.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by failing to list non-government travel outside the U.S. (&para; 2.a).  Conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the 
applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA his travel to Macau and the PRC.  Proof Applicant omitted this 
information from his SCA shifted the burden to Applicant to explain the omissions sufficiently to negate a finding of knowing and deliberate falsification.  <EM>See</EM> 
ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant claims he misread the question on both SCAs and thought he was required to list official 
government travel outside the U.S. rather than any travel not authorized by the U.S. Government.  Applicant failed to convince me that his failure to list his 
travel on two SCAs, filed three years apart, was because he misread the question.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
