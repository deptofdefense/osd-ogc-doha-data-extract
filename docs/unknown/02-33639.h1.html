<P>Applicant is one of many boat people who left Vietnam after the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975. He is a 43-year-old man who, at the age of 16, fled 
Vietnam in 1977. He was allowed to immigrate to the U.S. as a refugee and he has since obtained a college education, registered for the selective service, and 
he is now a U.S. citizen. He is employed as a computer programmer for a large defense contractor. Applicant's father and eight siblings are resident citizens of 
Vietnam. Based on the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concern of foreign influence based on his family ties to 
Vietnam. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 2, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security 
concern under Guideline B for foreign influence. Applicant replied to the SOR on June 21, 2004, and requested a hearing. Department Counsel indicated he 
was ready to proceed on November 8, 2004, and the case was assigned to me November 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for 
December 27, 2004. Applicant appeared with counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. For unknown reasons, DOHA did not receive the transcript until 
arch 7, 2005. The transcript delay, coupled with a heavy caseload, have delayed issuing a decision in this case.  </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER> FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations except for subparagraph 1.e. His admissions are incorporated into my findings, and after a thorough 
review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant testified during the hearing, and I find his testimony credible. In making this finding, I note that English is not Applicant's native language and some 
allowances have been made for potential communication problems.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is one of many boat people who left Vietnam after the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975. He is 43 years old, married, and the father of two native-born U.S. citizen children. Like Applicant, his wife is a native of Vietnam and she is now a U.S. citizen. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance, for the 
first time, in conjunction with his employment as a computer programmer for a defense contractor. </P> 
<P>In 1977, the then 16-year-old Applicant, at his parents' urging, fled Vietnam by boat. His father encouraged Applicant to depart because it appeared Applicant 
would be conscripted into the Vietnamese military. Applicant traveled by boat to Malaysia where he stayed for about seven months before arriving in the U.S. 
under the sponsorship of relatives already living in the U.S.</P> 
<P>Applicant obtained a college education in the U.S., and he has been working as a computer programmer since about January 1995. He currently earns about 
$52,000.00 annually. His wife earns a higher salary, and together they own a home and investments in the U.S. Neither Applicant nor his wife has any financial 
interests in Vietnam.</P> 
<P>In February 2001, Applicant completed a security-clearance application (Exhibit 1). In it, he revealed, among other things, his birth in Vietnam, that he obtained 
U.S. citizenship, and that he had immediate family members who are Vietnamese citizens residing in Vietnam. He also indicated he had registered, as required 
by federal law, with the U.S. Selective Service System. </P> 
<P>In April 2002, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), and the interview produced a sworn statement (Exhibit 2). 
Because it is brief, the statement is quoted in full:</P> 
<P>I could not be influenced by other government because of my family or relatives. If in the situation that they threaten my family or my wife and children, right 
now, I don't know how to handle it. (I hope it won't happen to me). I [have] loyalty to the United States of America.</P> 
<P>In his response to the SOR, Applicant, noting that English was his second language, further explained that he would report any threat incident to his security 
officer immediately.</P> 
<P>Applicant's father is a resident citizen of Vietnam. He is a retired fisherman. He has no connection with the Vietnamese government or military or with any 
organization or company that would have an interest in U.S. classified information. Applicant has fairly regular contact with his father, perhaps calling once a 
month to check on his father's health and general welfare.</P> 
<P>Applicant's eight siblings (brothers and sisters) are resident citizens of Vietnam. They all have rather work-a-day lives working as fishermen, shopkeepers, and 
the like. None of the siblings have connections with the Vietnamese government or military or with any organization or company that would have an interest in 
U.S. classified information. Applicant does not have regular contact with his siblings, but may speak to one if present when he telephones his father. </P> 
<P>In addition to these siblings, Applicant has one brother who is a resident citizen of the U.S. Also present in the U.S. are Applicant's grandparents, three uncles, 
and numerous other family members.</P> 
<P>As a sign of respect and to help, Applicant sends money to his father. The amount varies, but ranges from $300.00 to $500.00 annually. Applicant provides no 
financial assistance to his siblings. </P> 
<P>Since fleeing Vietnam in 1977, Applicant has returned twice, both times as a U.S. citizen using a U.S. passport. The purpose of the first trip was to introduce 
his wife to his family. The purpose of the second trip was to attend his mother's funeral. Applicant had no problems or difficulties with Vietnamese officials 
during these two trips.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN></STRONG>   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or </P> 
<P>absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case 
can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Common sense suggests that t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he stronger the ties of affection or 
obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a 
foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline B. Applicant has family ties to Vietnam, as evidenced 
by his father and eight siblings who are citizens of and residents in Vietnam. He has fairly regular contact with his father by monthly telephone calls and 
irregular contact with his siblings (no doubt the relationships with his siblings have grown distant since he left Vietnam in 1977). His two trips to Vietnam are 
also evidence of his family ties. Taken together, these circumstances raise a security concern under DC 1.<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the MC under Guideline B and conclude that MC 1<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record evidence shows that Applicant's family members are not Vietnamese agents or agents of any other foreign power,<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and so the issue under MC 1 is if 
the family members are in a position to be exploited by the Vietnamese government. Although Vietnam is a communist-controlled country, the U.S. and 
Vietnam normalized diplomatic relations in 1995, and the normalization process continues to date. More specific to this case, his family members are not 
employed by or connected to the Vietnamese military or a governmental agency or some other organization that may have an interest in U.S. classified 
information. Given these circumstances, his family members are not in a position where they could be subject to exploitation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to MC 1, MC 5<A HREF="02-33639.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> applies for Applicant, as neither he nor his wife has any financial interests in Vietnam. They earn their incomes by working hard 
for U.S. employers, and they own a home and investments in the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The analysis does not necessarily end with the formal mitigating conditions, as other matters under the whole-person concept may mitigate the security concern. 
First, Applicant's commitment to the U.S. is high. It is difficult to fully appreciate the gravity of his decision, at the age of 16, to leave his immediate family and 
flee Vietnam for a possibility of becoming a U.S. citizen. Indeed, it was a potential life-and-death decision. Second, Applicant's ties or connections to the U.S. 
are strong. He has lived in the U.S. for essentially his entire adult life. Since his arrival here, Applicant can fairly be described as a model immigrant. He 
registered with the selective service, obtained a college education, and is employed as a computer programmer. Moreover, his professional career and financial 
interests are in the U.S. and that situation is unlikely to change. These are examples of ties that bind most members of a participatory democracy such as the 
U.S. To sum up, the record evidence demonstrates Applicant has all the indicators of a self-reliant, industrious, mature, responsible, and trustworthy individual. 
After weighing the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the foreign influence security concern raised by his family ties 
to Vietnam. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the 
whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P>
