<P>Applicant incurred more than $85,000.00 in debt as a result of overspending and poor financial management. His debts were twice discharged by the bankruptcy court in 1996 and again in 2003. 
Yet, he again incurred debt, some of which is currently delinquent and not resolved. He has not mitigated or overcome the government's concerns regarding his security eligibility and suitability 
based on financial considerations. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On October 13, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Applicant submitted a notarized response to the 
allegations dated November 11, 2005. He elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant with a complete copy on December 30, 2005. Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted a response and additional evidence on January 23, 2005. This case was assigned to me on February 9, 2006.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>

<P>Applicant submitted a copy of an agreement dated December 2, 1998, regarding payment terms for his monthly child support and for his $11,045.19 in child support arrearage.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> Under the terms of

Although he states that his wages are being garnished to pay the arrearage, he has not submitted any documentation to show the garnishment or the current balance on this debt. From the evidence of 
record, it does not appear that he is paying his arrearage as agreed.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines 
as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process 
provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and 
material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the 
presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be 
followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> The government has 
the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable 
clearance decision.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance,<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> Any reasonable 
doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-03482.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not 
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked 
to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>The government established its case under Guideline F. Applicant has a long history of excessive debt, as the result of over spending and poor financial management. After the bankruptcy court's 
1996 discharge of more than $50,000.00 of debt, he was given the opportunity to start fresh and manage his finances. He failed, and again incurred significant debt, which is now resolved because 
he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy a second time. Subsequent to his second bankruptcy discharge, he incurred additional unpaid debt. He still owes significant money in back child support. Under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts</EM>) apply.</P> 
 
<P>A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated in several ways. Applicant's debt problems have been ongoing for a number of years, are not recent, and are not an isolated 
incident. Thus, he has not established a mitigating condition under Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1. (<EM>The behavior was not recent),</EM> and E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>It was an 
isolated incident).</EM> Likewise, since he has not established that his debts are the result of factors beyond his control or that he received counseling for his credit problems, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>The 
conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control...</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) do not apply.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has initiated a good faith effort to repay the small debt. Since receiving the SOR, he has paid three of his previously unpaid debts. He has also established that one debt was discharged as 
a result of his 2003 bankruptcy filing. While the credit reports reflect that he has paid some money on his child support arrearage, he has not provided any information showing a recent reduction in 
the amount owed on his back child support or the monthly child support garnishment payments, which he contends he is paying. Several years ago, he paid the check dishonored by the bank. In light 
of these efforts, FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) may apply. However, he still has several unresolved, 
delinquent debts. His long and repeated history of excessive debt reflects a pattern of problematic financial management which outweighs his recent efforts to pay some of his outstanding debt. 
Since his most recent bankruptcy discharge, he has again failed to pay all his debts, even though he has sufficient monthly income to do so. He has not demonstrated an ability to manage his 
finances on a consistent level. Since he will be paying student loans in the future, I have concerns about his ability to pay this debt given his inability to manage his finances. He has failed to 
overcome the government's concerns regarding his security worthiness. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security 
clearance to Applicant.</P>
