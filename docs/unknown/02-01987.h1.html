<P>Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He was born in Cuba, but came to the U.S. at age 12. Applicant's immediate family are U.S. citizens, and he has an 
elderly aunt who recently became a permanent resident alien here. In 1997, he obtained a Cuban passport so he could visit his aunt. However, heeding a travel 
advisor that it was not then safe for U.S. citizens to go to Cuba at the time, he cancelled the trip. The Cuban passport expired, but he renewed it in 1999 and 
made a five-day trip to Cuba. He has since returned the Cuban passport and renounced his Cuban citizenship. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns 
under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On April 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (SOR) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information 
available to the Government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On May 2, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on June 3, 2003. On June 9, 2003, DOHA 
issued a Notice of Hearing setting this case to be heard on June 27, 2003. All parties appeared as scheduled, the government presented documentary evidence, 
and the Applicant testified in his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on July 9, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With the exception of the allegation at subparagraph 1.a, Applicant has admitted the allegations in the SOR. Additionally,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> after a thorough review of the 
pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 34-year-old senior network operations manager for a large telecommunications company. He first received a security clearance in 1988. The 
clearance was administratively terminated when he went to work for a different company, but he received another clearance in 1997 when he was hired by his 
current employer. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He was born in Cuba in 1964, but came to the United States when in 1977 when he was 12-years-old. Applicant was educated in U.S. high schools and a 
technical school. He is currently pursuing a college degree. He married a naturalized U.S. citizen from El Salvador in 1994. They have two children, both born 
in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Before he came to the U.S., Applicant, his mother and his three sisters lived with a maternal aunt. His father had gone to the U.S. ahead of the rest of the family 
in 1970. Applicant, his mother, and his sisters came to the U.S. via Spain in 1977, but his aunt did not come here until December, 2000. His aunt is the only 
family member living in the U.S. who is not a U.S. citizen. Applicant's only remaining relatives in Cuba are cousins and other distant relatives who he does not 
know very well and with whom he has no contact. Applicant has no property of financial interests in Cuba.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In July 1997, before he went to work for his current employer, Applicant obtained a Cuban passport so he could visit his aunt in Cuba in accordance with 
procedures outlined by the State Department. He then made arrangements to travel to Cuba, but cancelled the trip after a State Department travel warning 
recommended against travel to Cuba because of bomb threats by Central American insurgents. In 1999, Applicant renewed his Cuban passport and traveled 
with his mother and a sister to Cuba for five days. Before taking these actions, Applicant consulted with his company's security officer and made his intentions 
known.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has renounced officially his foreign citizenship, and he has relinquished his foreign passport, which expired in 2001. He has said that he would 
willingly bear arms for the United States against Cuba or any other foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has earned high marks for his job performance. He has intelligently expressed a full awareness of and appreciation for the freedom and prosperity he 
enjoys as an American, especially in contrast to Cuba's poverty and oppressive government.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, specifically, that Applicant has close ties of affection to foreign citizens, I conclude 
the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign Preference).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in 
ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
Government.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence). </STRONG>A</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she 
may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential 
for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other 
countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has established its case under Guideline B by showing that Applicant has close ties of affection to a foreign citizen, namely, his maternal aunt. 
As alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a, Applicant's aunt, to whom he has been close since his childhood, is still a citizen of Cuba. Guideline B disqualifying 
condition (DC) 1<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies here. I do not agree, however, that he has close ties of affection to his distant relatives still in Cuba. They are not immediate family 
members within the meaning of this guideline. Further, he has seen them once since he was 12-years-old, and does not appear to have any on-going contact with 
them. As for his aunt, she is an elderly woman with no ties to the Cuban government, who is seeking U.S. citizenship after coming to this country two years 
ago. Applicant's contacts with this foreign citizen have no security significance. Guideline B mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies here. In light of the 
foregoing, and in consideration of the lack of any significant contacts in Cuba or any other foreign country, I conclude Guideline B for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline C (Foreign Preference).</STRONG> A security concern arises when an individual <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">acts in a way that may indicate a preference for the interests of a foreign 
country over those of the United States, raising the possibility he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests 
of the United States.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Here, the government's concerns stem from Applicant's acquisition and use of a foreign passport, conduct which constitutes exercise of 
dual citizenship. Guideline C DC 1<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 2<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply here. Cuba considers anyone born there who left after 1970 to still be a Cuban citizen and imposes its 
own entry requirements on those persons if they want to travel to Cuba.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Whether he realized it or not, Applicant exercised his Cuban citizenship when he 
decided to obtain, then renew a Cuban passport so he could visit his aunt. It does not appear he could have visited Cuba without complying with Cuban laws 
governing travel by Cuban-born Americans. The choice to do so, however, was his to make, but he did not do so lightly. Before going to Cuba in 1999, he 
researched the State Department guidelines for limited travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, and he consulted his security officer, who required only that be debriefed 
after his trip. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant possessed but did not renew the Cuban passport after it expired in 2001. After receiving the SOR and being informed of the DoD policy against 
granting or continuing a security clearance for persons who possess a foreign passport, he relinquished his passport. He also has renounced officially his Cuban 
citizenship.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Guideline C MC 4<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies. Further, when he obtained, then renewed his Cuban passport, the current DoD policy on foreign passports as 
contained in the August 2000 OASDC3I memorandum (known as the "Money memo" after its author) was not yet available. I credit Applicant with complying 
with that part of the Money memo that provides for mitigation if an Applicant relinquishes his foreign passport.<A HREF="02-01987.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> I conclude Guideline C for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence in this case, and I have applied the aforementioned disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each 
applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. Despite the exercise of dual citizenship by Applicant, the 
security significance of his conduct is diminished by the fact he has lived in the U.S. since childhood. His and his family's lives are clearly and fully vested in 
America, with no interests in Cuba or contacts there that might reasonably be used as leverage by the Cuban government. His isolated exercise of Cuban 
citizenship is not likely to recur, and  I am convinced that Applicant's foreign connections do not undermine his suitability for clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
