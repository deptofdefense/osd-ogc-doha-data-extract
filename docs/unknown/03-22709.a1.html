<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On December 27, 2004, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On August 15, 2005, after considering the 
record, Administrative Judge David S. Bruce denied Applicant's request for a security clearance. Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; 
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions regarding Applicant's 2001 termination by his 
private employer and his description of that event on a 2002 security clearance application were arbitrary and capricious in light of all the record evidence. </P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that: in 2001, Applicant was terminated by a private employer for poor performance on the job, associated with unauthorized 
use of the company computer system (including to access pornographic web sites).  Applicant understood his unauthorized use of the computer system resulted 
in poor performance at the time, but did not reveal it to his wife and family.  In June 2002, Applicant prepared a security clearance application, wherein he 
acknowledged having been fired and explained that it had been due to unsatisfactory performance, low product demand, a reduction-in-force and personnel 
reorganization mandates. The Judge's findings represent a plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  The Judge concluded that Guideline E, Disqualifying 
Condition 1<A HREF="03-22709.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Disqualifying Condition 2<A HREF="03-22709.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> applied to Applicant's case.  The Judge discussed several mitigating conditions and the "whole person" concept, 
and concluded that Applicant had not shown that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Applicant argues for 
an alternative interpretation of the record evidence and then the successful application of mitigating conditions and a favorable "whole person" analysis based 
on the alternative interpretation.  Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.  The Board need not agree with the Judge to conclude that his 
interpretation and resultant analysis are sustainable.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance. </P>

<P>The decision of the Administrative Judge denying  Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.</P>
