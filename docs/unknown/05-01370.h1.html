<P>Applicant holds an active Romanian passport and is reluctant to renounce her Romanian citizenship.  Her brother, mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and aunt 
are citizens and residents of Romania.  Her mother is a citizen of the Romania and a permanent resident of the U.S., but she visits Romania with Applicant's 
school-age son for 3-4 months each summer.  Security concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 19, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant 
a security clearance to Applicant. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Under Guideline 
C, the SOR alleges Applicant holds an active Romanian passport (&para; 1.a.); she is unwilling to renounce her Romanian citizenship because it offers health care 
benefits for her son in Romania (&para; 1.b.); and she exercised Romanian citizenship by obtaining dental care while visiting Romania in April 2002 (&para; 1.c.).  Under 
Guideline C, the SOR alleges Applicant's mother is a citizen and resident of Romania who also periodically resides in the U.S. (&para; 2.b.); and her brother, 
parents-in-law, two sisters-in-law, and her aunt are citizens and residents of Romania (&para;&para; 2.a., 2.c., 2.d., and 2.e.).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 13, 2005.  Under Guideline C, she admitted the allegation in SOR &para; 1.a. but denied the allegations in &para;&para; 
1.b. and 1.c.  Under Guideline B, she admitted all the allegations but explained that her mother (&para; 2.b.) has obtained a green card and "resides in the United 
States and periodically in Romania."  She also pointed out her father-in-law (&para;2.c.) is dead.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  She elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written record in lieu 
of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on October 26, 2005.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was 
provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  
Applicant received the FORM on October 28, 2005 and responded on December 4, 2005.  The case was assigned to me on December 9, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old quality inspector for a defense contractor.  She has worked for her current employer since October 2003.  She has never held a 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her spouse were born, raised, and married in Romania.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  They fled from Romania in 1980 because of its oppressive Communist government, and 
went to Greece as refugees.  After seven months in Greece they chose to immigrate to the U.S.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 1987, and 
her spouse became a U.S. citizen in October 1988.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  They have a son, born in the U.S., who is about 8 years old.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is deceased.  Her mother is a citizen of Romania who resides in the U.S. for about eight months each year, holds permanent resident alien 
status, and cares for Applicant's son during the school year.  Her mother spends the summer traveling in Romania with Applicant's son.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother, two sisters, mother-in-law, and aunt are citizens and residents of Romania.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Her brother is a mechanical engineer involved in designing 
hydroelectric plants, and his wife is a chemical engineer who tests food products for the Romanian government.  She has weekly e-mail contact with her brother 
as well as weekly telephone contact during the summer months when her mother and son are visiting.  The rest of her immediate family are retired.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A sister of Applicant's spouse owns a drugstore in Romania.  The record contains no information about Applicant's mother-in-law or her aunt, except for the 
fact that her aunt lived with her father and cared for him until he died.  She told a security investigator she has no contact with anyone in Romania except her 
immediate family.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant obtained a Romanian passport in January 2003.  In an interview with a security investigator, she stated she obtained it as "a novelty" and "something 
of a whim."  She also holds a U.S. passport, which she used to travel to Romania and other countries in 1995 and 2002, after she obtained the Romanian 
passport.  She told the security investigator she has never used to Romanian passport, and she would be willing to surrender it "should that be a requirement of 
my clearance."<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also told the investigator she was not sure she would renounce her Romanian citizenship because it provides health care benefits for her son.  She 
stated a renunciation of her Romanian citizenship would require some thought, and she could not make the decision at the time of the interview.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Romania is a democracy with an elected president, a two-chamber parliament, and an independent judiciary.  Since the 1989 revolution, it has actively pursued 
a policy of strengthening ties with the West, especially the U.S. and the European Union.  It has participated in several peacekeeping operations and was the 
first country to enroll in the NATO Partnership for Peace program.  NATO invited Romania to become a member in 2002, and it officially joined the 
organization in March 2004.  In January 2004, Romania began a two-year term as an elected member of the United Nations Security Council.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  The U.S. and 
Romania are actively cooperating in securing the Black Sea region.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Romania has a market economy that has been in transition since the 1989 revolution.  Economic crimes against tourists, although usually non-confrontational 
and non-violent, are a problem.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Romania has a generally good human rights record.  However, there have been problems with police abuses, restrictions on freedom of speech and the press, 
and harassment of minorities.<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C: Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., he or she may be prone to provide information or make 
decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A disqualifying condition may arise if an individual exercises dual citizenship 
(DC 1), possesses or uses a foreign passport (DC 2), or accepts "educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement or social welfare, from a foreign 
country" (DC 4).  Directive &para;&para; E2.A3.1.2.1., E2.A3.1.2.2., E2.A3.1.2.4. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant exercised her dual citizenship by obtaining a Romanian passport after she became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Accordingly, I conclude DC 1 is 
established.  Although the evidence shows she has never used her Romanian passport, her possession of an active foreign passport establishes DC 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted she obtained dental work in Romania while visiting her father in March 2002.  The record does not indicate, however, whether her dental 
work was a citizenship-based entitlement, an entitlement based on her father's citizenship, or a service available to citizens as well as foreigners.  I conclude the 
dental work, standing alone, does not establish DC 4, and I resolve SOR &para;1.c. in her favor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record does indicate, however, that Applicant is unwilling to renounce her Romanian citizenship because it entitles her 8-year-old son to health care 
benefits.  There is no evidence that any benefits have actually been received, but her reluctance to relinquish those benefits tends to show foreign preference, 
even though it does not fall within the specific terms of DC 4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several mitigating conditions are relevant.  MC 1 applies if dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Directive &para; 
E2.A3.1.3.1.  MC 1 is established, because Applicant did not affirmatively seek foreign citizenship, but acquired it by virtue of her birth in Romania to 
Romanian parents.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When possession or use of a foreign passport is involved, the clarifying guidance issued by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, 
Communications, and Intelligence (the "Money Memorandum"), dated August 16, 2000, requires denial of a clearance unless the applicant surrenders the 
foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the U.S. government.  Applicant received a copy of the Money Memorandum in the FORM,<A HREF="05-01370.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> but 
she produced no evidence of compliance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Willingness to renounce dual citizenship is a mitigating condition (MC 4).  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.3.4.  MC 4 is not established, because Applicant has declined to 
renounce her Romanian citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and considering all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated the security concern based on foreign preference.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B: Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para; 2.b. alleges Applicant's mother is a citizen and resident of Romania, but it is refuted in part, because the evidence shows her mother is a citizen of 
Romania and a permanent resident of the U.S.  SOR &para; 2.c. alleges her parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Romania, but it is refuted in part because the 
evidence shows her father-in-law is dead.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."  ISCR Case 
No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   Applicant has stated she has contact with only her immediate family, but she has not 
addressed her ties of obligation, if any, to her mother-in-law.  Thus, the presumption of ties of obligation to her mother-in-law is not rebutted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude DC 1 is established.  Applicant's mother is a citizen of Romania who is present in Romania for 3-4 months each year, her son is present in Romania 
for 3-4 months each year, and her brother and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Romania.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A disqualifying condition (DC 3) may arise if an individual has relatives "who are connected with any foreign government."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  I 
conclude DC 3 is established, because Applicant's sister-in-law is employed as a chemical engineer by the Romanian government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the Government  produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1 and DC 3, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign 
country or who are connected with a foreign government, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members, cohabitant, or 
associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose 
between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents 
of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not 
agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) 
involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Although Romania is friendly to the U.S., the 
distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and 
unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security.  We know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR 
Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  We also know countries with stable, democratic governments and good 
human rights records engage in intelligence gathering.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's 
government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable 
to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family 
member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nature of Romania's government, its human rights record, and its relationship with the U.S. are clearly not determinative.  Nevertheless, they are all 
relevant factors in determining whether Romania would risk damaging its relationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order to 
force a U.S. citizen to betray the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of Applicant's immediate family members are agents of a foreign power under either the statutory definition in 50 U.S.C. 1801(b) or the broader 
definition apparently adopted by the Appeal Board.  <EM>See</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 02-24254, 2004 WL 2152747 at *4-5 (App. Bd. Jun.29, 2004) (employee of foreign 
government need not be employed at a high level or in a position involving intelligence, military, or other national security duties to be an agent of a foreign 
power for purposes of MC 1). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Her brother works for a major industry susceptible to involvement in industrial espionage, and her sister-in-law appears to be 
connected to the government as an employee.  She has frequent contact with her brother, a citizen and resident of Romania, and her mother, a permanent 
resident of the U.S. who spends her summers in Romania.  She is unwilling to renounce her Romanian citizenship because it affords medical benefits to her son 
while he spends his summers in Romania. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each 
individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Considering her family ties individually as well as in 
totality, it is clear she has significant family connections to Romania, and her family has connections to Romanian industry and government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 
5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  I conclude she has not carried her burden of establishing MC 1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  The 
record reflects Applicant visited her aunt once in 2002, but she now has contact only with her immediate family.  Thus, MC 3 is established in part with respect 
to her in-laws and her aunt, but not with respect to her mother and brother.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions and considering all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant 
has not mitigated the security concern based on foreign influence.</SPAN></P>
