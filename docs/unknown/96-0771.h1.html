</P>

<P>	On 25 October 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="96-0771.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 19 November 1996, Applicant answered the SOR and
requested an administrative decision on the record. Applicant did not respond to the
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 23 December 1996; the record in this
case closed 14 February 1997, the day the response was due at DOHA. I received the case on 23
April 1997 to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR, but denied the conclusory
allegation of Paragraph 1.; accordingly, I incorporate Applicant's admissions as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 36-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain a secret
clearance.</P>

<P>	The allegations of the SOR revolve around Applicant's extensive history of alcohol
abuse. Applicant first abused alcohol in approximately 1977, when he consumed alcohol as a
minor. In July 1977, he was arrested for an open container offense. He had a driving while
intoxicated (DWI) arrest in November 1981. In January 1984, Applicant applied for a security
clearance while in the military.<A HREF="96-0771.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  However, despite security concerns about his alcohol
consumption, Applicant continued to drink excessively. He had another DWI in February 1992,<A HREF="96-0771.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>
and again in November 1995.<A HREF="96-0771.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> Applicant has drunk six to twelve can of beer a week from 1978
to May 1996. While he admits that he has used alcohol irresponsibly in the past, he denies that
alcohol has adversely affected his home life, career, finances or health. He denies receiving
counseling or treatment as a result of alcohol consumption. He intends to consume alcohol
moderately in the future; he considers his present level of alcohol consumption to be moderate.</P>

<P>	Applicant has a satisfactory work record. His ----------- manager and shift supervisor
vouch for his character and work ethic; however, neither appears aware of his alcohol abuse
history.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (CRITERION G)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the
influence. . .</P>

<P>		Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		None.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish
his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to
demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion G. The record clearly establishes
Applicant's alcohol abuse. He had alcohol-related arrests in 1977 and 1981. In 1984, he became
aware of the security significance of his alcohol consumption when those arrests where the focus of
a subject interview relating to Applicant's military security clearance. Yet, despite this awareness,
Applicant again had DWI arrests in 1992 and 1995. In his 1996 sworn statement (Item 5)--as in his
1984 sworn statement (Item 7)--Applicant denies having an alcohol problem. However, the record
belies that claim. While consumption of 6-12 beers a week is not necessarily inherently abusive, it
is clear that Applicant has, on occasion, consumed those beers abusively. Further, I note that the
drink of choice the night of the most recent DWI was not beer, but tequila.  Applicant's work
performance suggests that alcohol has not affected his performance. However, the Government's
legitimate security concerns extend to Applicant's off-duty hours; Applicant's character references
appear to have no knowledge of this area of Applicant's life. While Applicant's alcohol abuse has
not resulted in more frequent alcohol-related incidents, the four documented incidents--two within
the last two years--are sufficient to raise significant concerns about Applicant's fitness for access
to classified information. The Government need not wait until Applicant's alcohol abuse worsen or
he actually mishandles classified information before acting. Applicant's responses demonstrate little
insight into the problems alcohol abuse has caused in his life and are insufficient to ameliorate those
concerns. He considers his present level of consumption to be moderate; I do not, as evidenced by
his arrests. Applicant promises that alcohol-related incidents will not recur; he made similar
representations in 1984, yet had two additional DWI arrests. I conclude that Applicant is likely to
abuse alcohol in the future. Accordingly, I find criterion G. against Applicant.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January
2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996  (Directive).
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Applicant's alcohol consumption raised security concerns even then. On 16 March 1984, Applicant addressed
the issue of his two alcohol-related incidents: "I realize the indications this may give one. I would like to state for the
record,  that I do not have and have never had a drinking problem. I never drink at home and on the occasion when I
do step out socially with my spouse, I never drink anything stronger than beer. A DWI arrest is a painfully learning
experience and I feel at this time that I have matured beyond this type of behavior. . . The shadow of the DWI is
constantly pervading my thoughts on [occasions when I do drink] as it is a permanent black mark on my record. . ."
(Item 7).
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Applicant described the arrest: ". . . I had drank about six to eight cans of beer over a three hour period at a
local night club. Driving home, I was stopped by a [police] officer for weaving on the road. During the traffic stop, the
officer smelled alcohol on my breath and requested me to take a breathalyzer test. I submitted to the test, which
registered above the legal limit." (Item 5).
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Applicant described this arrest: ". . . I had drank about four or five 6 ounce glasses of tequila over a four hour
period at a local night club. Driving home, I was stopped by a [police] officer for weaving on the road. During the traffic
stop, the officer smelled alcohol on my breath and requested me to take a breathalyzer test. I submitted to the test, which
registered above the legal limit." (Item 5).
