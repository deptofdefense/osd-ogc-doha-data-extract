<P>Twenty-five-year-old Applicant's relatively brief period of alcohol abuse during his freshman year at college in 1997-98, as well as during a five month period 
in 2001, and his two alcohol-related incidents in 2001, including one charge of drunk in public--which was eventually dismissed by the court as "no 
offense"--and a charge of driving while intoxicated, have been mitigated by his apparent rehabilitation.  He successfully completed a court-mandated alcohol 
program and attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings; has, with the exception of a single glass of wine consumed in January 2003, remained abstinent since 
August 2001, has changed his lifestyle, and vowed future abstinence.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 19, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn, written statement, dated April 10, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was initially 
assigned to another Administrative Judge on July 23, 2003, but, due to caseload considerations, was reassigned to me on August 6, 2003.  A notice of hearing 
was issued that same date, and the hearing was held on August 20, 2003.  During the course of the hearing, five Government exhibits, two Applicant exhibits, 
and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 29, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted three of the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol under Guideline G (subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., and 1.d.), as well as a portion of an 
additional allegation (subparagraph 1.b.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  He denied the remaining allegations (subparagraph 1.e., 
and a portion of subparagraph 1.b.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a secret security clearance.  An interim security clearance was granted to him in 
August 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a former alcohol abuser.  His early alcohol consumption was undistinguished as to quantity and frequency, but his subsequent consumption, 
commencing at the age of 19, and coinciding with his enrollment in college in August 1997, became somewhat troublesome.  During his freshman year, on less 
than 10 occasions, he consumed unspecific, but excessive, quantities of alcohol to the point of intoxication.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  None of those episodes resulted in incidents of a 
reportable nature, and none resulted in arrests.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon completion of his freshman year, Applicant dropped out of school to work, initially in the family business, and eventually elsewhere.  His alcohol 
consumption during this entire post-freshman year in college was again undistinguished as to quantity and frequency.  Three years later, two alcohol-related 
incidents occurred which would alter the characterization of Applicant's relationship with alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first incident occurred in March 2001, when Applicant and his best friend were in a local bar for around three hours<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> celebrating his friend's birthday.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  
An unspecified number of alcoholic beverages were consumed during that period.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his friend departed the bar and were, as he described it, 
"talking loudly and generally having a good time."<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  They were apparently making too much noise and were arrested and charged with a class 4 misdemeanor - 
drunk in public.  Applicant spent the night in jail and was released the following morning.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  On April 17, 2001, the charge was dismissed with a notation "no 
offense."<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Although Applicant initially indicated he had been fined,<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> he subsequently modified his position to indicate a fine had been mailed to the court but 
never processed or cashed.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Court records reveal no evidence that a fine was ordered.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second, and most recent, incident occurred five months later, in August 2001, when Applicant and some friends were in a local club for about three hours 
celebrating his new job.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He consumed approximately seven alcoholic beverages, including beer and vodka,<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> confident the designated driver among them 
would drive him home.  Unfortunately, that person disappeared and Applicant decided to drive himself home.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  At about 2:46AM, he was stopped by the 
police and administered both field and breathalyzer tests, both of which he failed.  Applicant registered .20 percent and was charged with driving while 
intoxicated (DWI) 1<SUP>st</SUP> offense.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A pre-court evaluation of Applicant performed by a probation counselor with the county Alcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP) assessed him to be a "problem 
drinker."<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The probation counselor opined that Applicant was apparently minimizing his self-reported history of alcohol consumption and recommended 
referral to the county ASAP.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  In November 2001, Applicant pled guilty to the charge and was ordered to pay a fine of $300.00 and entered into the county 
ASAP.  In addition, his operator's license was suspended for a period of one year.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant commenced his new position in another state, the county ASAP referred him to a similar program in the state of his new residence.  He 
enrolled in the program in January 2002 and participated in 29 group sessions, one individual session, and two Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per 
week.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Urinalyses were performed on two occasions and both tests were negative for mood-altering substances.  As of May 2002, Applicant was still not 
convinced of the perils of alcohol, and denied the existence of an alcohol problem.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Nevertheless, he vowed not to drink alcohol to excess in the future, but 
conceded he might continue to consume some wine with dinner.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Applicant eventually accepted his powerlessness over alcohol and realized the dangers in 
continuing his relationship with alcohol.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Upon his successful completion of the program in July 2002, the discharge diagnostic impression rendered by his 
substance abuse counselor--a person with an M.S. degree and no other apparent professional designation--was alcohol abuse, in apparent remission.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  His 
prognosis was reflected as "good," provided he followed the two recommendations: 1) abstinence for an unspecified period, and 2) attendance at an unspecified 
number of AA meeting for an unspecified period.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has dramatically altered his attitude, relationship with alcohol, and his lifestyle, and he no longer goes to bars.  Furthermore, he has abstained from 
any alcohol consumption since his August 2001 arrest, with the exception of a glass wine he consumed while having dinner with his parents in January 2003.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  
Thereafter, he apparently experienced an epiphany--in large measure motivated by his experiences in the alcohol program and the loss of his interim security 
clearance--and has sworn off all future alcohol consumption.<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 2000, at the age of 22, Applicant was hired as a desktop technician by a government contractor.  That company was taken over by his current employer, 
and Applicant was promoted, first to junior network engineer, and then to network engineer.  Applicant's character and the quality of his job performance have 
been very favorably characterized by his direct supervisor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the "clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security" standard<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard.  For the purposes herein, despite the different 
language in each, I have concluded those standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, 
logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  Because of this special relationship the Government must be able 
to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, 
by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions 
are predictive in nature and must often address potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline G, the Government has established its case.  Commencing in about August 1997, and continuing for a period of one year, and then 
again for about five months in 2001 (March through August), Applicant seemingly threw caution to the wind and exhibited a pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, and immature behavior by becoming an occasional alcohol abuser.  While his college-related alcohol consumption created no legal problems 
and no incidents, the subsequent five month period saw two alcohol-related incidents with police involvement.  On the first occasion, in March 1997, after 
consuming an unspecified number of alcoholic beverages during a three hour period in a local bar, he was charged with a class 4 misdemeanor--drunk in 
public--and spent the night in jail.  Fortuitously, the charge was dismissed by the court with a notation "no offense."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second, and more significant, incident occurred five months later, in August 2001, when Applicant spent three hours with friends in a local club consuming 
seven alcoholic beverages, including beer and vodka.  When the designated driver among them disappeared, Applicant foolishly decided to drive himself home. 
 These incidents and the conduct which contributed to the incidents fall within Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. (<EM>alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>) 
and DC E2.A7.1.2.5.(<EM>habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The pre-court evaluation of Applicant performed by the county ASAP probation counselor in October 2001 assessed him to be a "problem drinker."  That 
"assessment" term does not constitute a "diagnosis," and has not been further defined.  Moreover, while the term "assessment" may by similar to an 
"evaluation," there is no evidence to indicate the probation counselor is a "licensed clinical social worker" as referred to in DC E2.A7.1.2.4. (<EM>evaluation of 
alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program</EM>).  Thus, DC 
E2.A7.1.2.4. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eventual July 2002 diagnostic impression of alcohol abuse, in apparent remission, was rendered by his substance abuse counselor--a person with an M.S. 
degree and no other apparent professional designation.  There is no evidence to indicate the substance abuse counselor is a "credentialed medical 
professional"<A HREF="02-23131.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> While there is substantial evidence, in my view, to support a finding Applicant was an alcohol abuser, there has been no such diagnosis 
provided by a "credentialed medical professional."  Thus, DC E2.A7.1.2.3. (<EM>diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical 
psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence</EM>) does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For a relatively brief period, alcohol clearly adversely impacted Applicant's life.  The pattern of his abuse has caused him to be fined, detained, and even jailed.  
It appears the most recent evidence of an alcohol problem occurred in August 2001, when he was last arrested.  I do not give much security significance to his 
consumption of one glass of wine at dinner with his parents in January 2003.  As indicated above, Applicant's attitude and relationship with alcohol have 
evolved over time.  Initially, he saw no problem and occasionally consumed too much alcohol.  Upon receiving professional intervention, guidance, counseling, 
and education, he became more accepting of the problem and limited his consumption to zero.  His abstinence remained for approximately 17 months until it 
was briefly interrupted by his consumption of one glass of wine with dinner.  While the impact of the alcohol program was substantial, the subsequent impact of 
the SOR solidified his resolve to swear off alcohol altogether.  His job and his security clearance are far too important to him and he is now more mature and 
responsible to risk resuming any relationship with alcohol.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's changed behavior clearly falls within Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A7.1.3.3. (<EM>positive changes in behavior supportive of 
sobriety</EM>).  There is no evidence to rebut Applicant's contention he has abstained, with one exception in January 2003, since August 2001.  The absence of any 
evidence of an alcohol <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">problem</SPAN> for approximately two years clearly falls within MC E2.A7.1.3.2. (<EM>the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no 
indication of a recent problem</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the evidence presented, I am confident that Applicant's alcohol abuse of the past will not recur.  There is convincing evidence of current sobriety.  He has 
taken efforts to rehabilitate himself, and it appears he has, in fact, been successful.  Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, 
successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's case with respect to the issue of alcohol consumption.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the 
SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
