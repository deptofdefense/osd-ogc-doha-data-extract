<P>Applicant was born in Lebanon, but came to the U.S. in 1984 and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1996. He still has family ties and financial interests in 
Lebanon, and he renewed and used his Lebanese passport for six years after he was naturalized. In 2002, Applicant gave up his Lebanese citizenship and 
passport. That same year, he also pleaded guilty to driving under the influence (DUI). Security concerns about his criminal conduct and foreign preference are 
mitigated; however, Applicant has not mitigated concerns about foreign influence. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On August 3, 2004, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline B (foreign influence), Guideline 
C (foreign preference), and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely answered the SOR, admitted with explanation all but one of the allegations,<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 
requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on July 18, 2005, and I convened a hearing on August 16, 2005. The government submitted 11 exhibits (GE 1 - 11), and Applicant 
submitted seven exhibits (AE A - H). Applicant also testified, and presented the testimony of two other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on August 
17, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I also find the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 41 years old, and is a partner in an engineering firm which supports a variety of Defense Department water treatment and desalinization efforts 
around the world.  He has applied for a security clearance to enable his company to participate in similar contracts with the State Department.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon, but left in 1984 at age 18 to study engineering in the United States. He worked his way through college and 
was hired in 1992 by an engineering firm where he met his current business partner. The two left the firm in October 1996 and started their own company, 
which has been very successful. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1996.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been married twice. His first marriage, to a U.S. citizen, ended in divorce in 1988. He re-married in 1993 to a Lebanese citizen. His current wife 
became a U.S. citizen in 1997, and the couple has two children, born in the U.S., both under 10 years of age.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is almost 70 years old. He has been retired for nearly 15 years from the Lebanese army, where he rose to the rank of Chief Warrant Officer. 
Applicant also has three siblings, a brother and two sisters. His brother was educated at a private U.S. university, then returned to Lebanon. He came back to the 
U.S. in May 2005, on a K-1 employment visa, presumably sponsored by the Applicant, to work as an accountant for Applicant's firm. One of his sisters is a 
teacher in the United Arab Emirates. The other sister was a teacher in Lebanon, but stopped working to stay at home and raise her children. Her husband leases 
land to businesses seeking to mine granite and other stones for commercial manufacturing applications. All of Applicant's immediate family members residing 
overseas are citizens of Lebanon.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law is also retired from the Lebanese army, having attained the rank of two-star lieutenant. Applicant's mother-in-law is a housewife. 
Applicant's three brothers-in-law are all educated professionals - an engineer, an architect, and an obstetrician/gynecologist. Applicant's wife's family are all 
citizens of Lebanon and reside in East Beirut, as do Applicant's father and one sister.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owns a house in Lebanon, where his father lives for most of the year. Applicant receives about $4,000 each year in rental income from his father, 
which is valued at an estimated $140,000. Applicant has also invested in an apartment building in Beirut, which he owns with his wife's brothers and her uncle. 
His investment is worth about $100,000 and Applicant sometimes uses one of the apartments when he is in Lebanon. His holdings in Lebanon constitute 
between 5% and 10% of his total net worth of more than $3,000,000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presented information about his personal and business finances. Part of the information consisted of a personal financial statement submitted to 
obtain a $500,000 line of credit for his company. Applicant included the value of his overseas real estate holdings in that statement as part of the overall 
calculation of his personal net worth, on which his credit as a company officer is based.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's company rents office space in Beirut to maintain a presence in the region and for business dealings there. Applicant feels there is a significant 
potential market for his company's water treatment and water supply engineering services in the Middle East. Indeed, Lebanon has in recent years made 
changes in its laws to allow more foreign investment there.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant travels to Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East several times each year. In May 1999, Applicant renewed his Lebanese passport even though he 
had become a U.S. citizen in 1992 and had received a U.S. passport in 1993. Applicant used his Lebanese passport when he traveled to Lebanon because it was 
convenient to do so. After he was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in July 2002, Applicant decided to give up his Lebanese citizenship 
and passport. He has since traveled using only his U.S. passport. As of the hearing, the last time he was in Lebanon was May 2005 to bring his brother back to 
the U.S. Since 1997, Applicant has traveled to Lebanon at least 24 times.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the summer of 2001, Applicant's company hired a Lebanese citizen who had just graduated as an engineer from a U.S. university. Applicant began the 
process of sponsoring the new hire for a visa commensurate with his status as a foreign citizen working in the U.S. Before the process was too far along, the 
sponsored employee was hired away by a different company for more money and has pursued his immigration matters through that company.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he has been interviewed by a local agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on several occasions. The agent contacts Applicant 
occasionally to ask his input, as a long-time U.S. resident from Lebanon, about people from the Middle East living in the area where Applicant lives in the U.S. 
He believes the FBI is trying to build and maintain a database of persons of interest as a result of heightened domestic security concerns after the 9-11 attacks.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Historically, Lebanon has had close ties with the U.S. and has a democratic form of government which allows representation of a variety of diverse factions 
within that country. Indicative of the diversity and inclusiveness of the Lebanese democracy is the fact several members of the terrorist organization Hezbollah 
are elected members of parliament. Since the late 1970s, Lebanon has been beset by prolonged civil wars, and occupation by military forces from Syria, a state 
sponsor of terrorism. Also, Islamic militant groups and terrorist organizations have been active there. Some of these groups have ties to Al-Qaida, and all are 
bent on the destruction of Israel and the expulsion of U.S. interests from the Middle East. Recent events, such as the assassination of the Lebanese Prime 
inister and car bombings in downtown Beirut, have contributed to heightened concern about the viability of Lebanon's close ties to the U.S. and the overall 
stability of that country. While the Lebanese government is on record as opposing the goals and methods of these groups, it has done nothing to stop them or 
expel them from Lebanon. Finally, Lebanon has a spotty human rights record, including government censorship of the media and restrictions on assembly, 
arbitrary arrests and detention, and torture aimed at groups intent on de-stabilizing the government. Also of concern is the lack of an independent judiciary as 
shown by that branch's record of vulnerability to influence by various political factions in Lebanon. However, there is no indication the government of Lebanon 
itself targets U.S. citizens or interests to obtain intelligence at the expense of U.S. interests.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was arrested on February 2, 2002, and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). He eventually pled guilty, was sentenced to 60 days 
in jail (suspended), placed on probation for two years, assessed a fine and court costs, had his drivers license suspended for one year, and ordered to complete 
an alcohol safety awareness course. Applicant has completed all the terms of his sentence and probation, his license has been reinstated, and there is no 
information suggesting he has an alcohol problem. Applicant has never been arrested for or committed any other criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline B (foreign 
influence), Guideline C (foreign preference), and Guideline J (criminal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who is willing to 
ignore the law, thereby risking criminal sanctions including fines and incarceration, may also be willing to disregard rules, regulations, and procedures intended 
to protect classified information. As alleged in SOR &para; 3.a, Applicant was arrested for and pleaded guilty to DUI. Under Guideline J, disqualifying condition  
(DC) 2<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. By contrast, this arrest was an isolated event, that occurred more than three years ago, and there is no indication Applicant abuses alcohol or 
has ever been anything other than an upstanding, law-abiding citizen. Guideline J mitigating condition (MC) 1<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 2<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. Further, this offense was a 
misdemeanor and it does not appear Applicant's background reflects "a history or pattern of criminal activity," begging the question why this allegation was 
included in the SOR in the first place. I conclude Guideline J for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern addressed under Guideline C is that an applicant who </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United 
States may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The SOR alleged here that Applicant 
renewed his Lebanese passport despite being a U.S. citizen and already holding a valid U.S. passport (SOR &para; 1.a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">), and that he used his Lebanese passport rather 
than his U.S. passport at least 13 times between 1997 and 2002 (SOR &para; 1.b). The government has presented sufficient evidence to support these allegations.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On 
these facts, Guideline C DC 1<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.  
On August 16, 2000, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (OASDC3I) issued a 
memorandum clarifying DoD policy on the security significance of foreign passport possession. According to that memorandum, a person holding and/or using 
a foreign passport is precluded from also holding a security clearance. Although there is no mitigating condition that directly corresponds to DC 2 (possession 
of a foreign passport), the OASDC3I memorandum provides that surrender of the passport or U.S. Government approval of its use may mitigate DC 2. In fact, 
long before the SOR was issued, Applicant renounced his foreign citizenship and relinquished his foreign passport. To his credit, he took these actions as soon 
as he realized during his subject interview with DSS that possession of a foreign passport and the exercise of dual citizenship might adversely affect his ability 
to obtain a security clearance. Guideline C MC 4<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies.  
The SOR also alleged in &para;&para; 1.c and 1.d that Applicant has property interests in Lebanon worth about $240,000. For these facts to be disqualifying under 
Guideline C, Applicant must be shown to have used his foreign citizenship to protect those interests.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The record here does not support such a finding. These 
same facts are alleged as a security concern under Guideline B, and are discussed within that context, below, but they do not adversely affect Applicant's 
suitability for clearance under Guideline C. Based on the totality of information available on the issue of foreign preference, I conclude Guideline C in favor of 
the Applicant. 
Under Guideline B, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Available information in this case 
supports the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b, that Applicant has close ties to his father and one sister and to his wife's parents and siblings  in Lebanon. 
Applicant's brother is now in the U.S. working for Applicant; however, the record is unclear about his brother's future residency or citizenship plans and it 
must be considered that he would return to Lebanon at some point. Further, as alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.c and 2.d, the record evidence shows Applicant's father and 
father-in-law have ties to the Lebanese government through their status as retired Army officers. These facts, in turn, support application of Guideline B DC 1,<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
and DC 3.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
By contrast, the foregoing requires consideration of MC 1.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's father and father-in-law have official connections to the Lebanese government through 
their status as retired Army officers, but their positions do not fall within the meaning of "agents of a foreign power,"<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> and none of Applicant's nor his wife's 
other relatives have any connection with the Lebanese government. However, application of MC 1 also turns on the question of whether the relatives are "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in a 
position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> 
With the exception of a sister who lives in the UAE, and, for the time being, his brother in the U.S., Applicant's father and his wife's relatives in Lebanon may 
be vulnerable to such pressure insofar as they live in and around Beirut in light of the ongoing violence fomented by terrorist groups there. Concern about their 
vulnerability to pressure by the Lebanese government must also take into account that country's human rights record. The Lebanese government may have 
committed human rights abuses, but those actions appear directed at the terrorist groups operating from Lebanon and with the intent to curtail terrorist activities. 
There is no indication such arbitrary actions would be directed against ordinary citizens such as Applicant's relatives and in-laws. 
Although it is unlikely the government of Lebanon itself would exert pressure on Applicant's family to gain access to U.S. classified information through his 
ties of affection, analysis of this aspect of MC 1 must also consider the terrorist groups operating in Lebanon. These groups have been included in statutory 
definitions of the term "foreign power"<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> and their presence in Lebanon must be considered, for purposes of MC 1 applicability, the same as a recognized 
foreign government or nation. Because the terrorist groups operating in Lebanon and the surrounding areas are engaged in international terrorism with stated 
goals of destroying U.S. interests or expelling U.S. interests from the Middle East, MC 1 cannot apply here. 
Applicant also has financial interests in Lebanon, as alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.e and 2.f, in the form of two investment properties. One of the properties he rents to 
his father for the cost of utilities. The other is an apartment building Applicant invested in with his three brothers-in-law and his wife's uncle, and where 
Applicant sometimes stays when he is in Lebanon. As alleged in SOR &para; 2.g, Applicant's company maintains an office in Beirut to try to market their services in 
what Applicant and the State Department both describe as an increasingly lucrative market for western businesses. The issue these allegations raise is whether 
Guideline B DC 8<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies.   
Applicant's position is that his personal holdings are minimal and of no security significance when compared to his overall net worth. Yet he relied in part on 
the value of the house and apartment to get a line of credit for his business. Additionally, as alleged in SOR &para; 2.i, Applicant travels extensively to Lebanon, 
ostensibly to promote his company's business prospects there. I conclude the totality of the information available warrants application of DC 8. I have also 
considered the corresponding MC 5.<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although it applies, its value to Applicant is limited. Applicant's house and his interest in the apartment building are a 
very small portion of Applicant's overall net worth. But his financial interests also include his ongoing efforts to establish his company's business in Lebanon 
and elsewhere. He travels to Lebanon several times annually to see his family and to promote his business interests. These are not minimal financial interests. 
Despite his claims to the contrary, his finances would be adversely affected if a foreign power were to act against his overseas holdings in an effort to leverage 
Applicant's access to classified information. The sum of the information available on the issue of foreign influence shows Applicant's personal and financial 
interests are still as intricately tied to Lebanon as they are to the U.S., despite having lived here for more than 20 years. On balance, I conclude Guideline B 
against the Applicant. 
I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the relevant adjudicative factors as appropriate. No single factor is dispositive of my decision in 
this matter. Applicant has successfully mitigated the government's concerns about his criminal conduct and about his exercise of his Lebanese citizenship. 
However, the resolution of one or more issues in favor of the Applicant does not compel a like resolution of the ultimate issue in this case; that is, whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest for Applicant to have access to classified information. Reasonable concerns remain about the presence of 
Applicant's family and Applicant's other connections and obligations in a foreign country. A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-05051.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> of the record before me shows 
the facts established in this case constitute an unacceptable risk that Applicant would be vulnerable to pressure that may cause him to undermine U.S. interests 
in favor of foreign interests. Accordingly, I conclude the available information is insufficient to resolve the government's doubts about Applicant's ability to 
protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.
