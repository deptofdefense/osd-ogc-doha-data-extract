<P>	Applicant's sister, who is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong, works for the Chinese
government. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are also citizens and residents of Honk Kong.
Applicant, a naturalized United States citizen since September 2001, receives a $4,000.00 monthly
pension from the Hong Kong government that is deposited directly into a Hong Kong bank. He also 
maintains approximately $1,050,000.00 in assets in Hong Kong. He surrendered his foreign passport

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On September 16, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-27396.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in
essence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence)
and Guideline C (foreign preference). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR, received by
DOHA on October 8, 2003, and requested a clearance decision based on the written record without
a hearing. Applicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR, although he claimed he had
surrendered his foreign passport.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 12, 2004, that
was mailed to Applicant January 13, 2004. Applicant responded to the FORM by submission of a
statement sworn to on February 7, 2004. Department Counsel did not object to the admissibility of
the information and supporting documents submitted by Applicant. The case was assigned to another
administrative judge on March 4, 2004, and reassigned to me on March 5, 2004, based on
administrative concerns.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a
thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant is 56 years old, married, and the father of two daughters, ages twenty-two and
eighteen. He, his wife, and daughters, all of Chinese ancestry, immigrated to the United States from
Hong Kong in 1995, and became naturalized U.S. citizens on September 14, 2001. They have resided
in the same residence since December 1995. Applicant's mother, who is eighty-two years old, and
a citizen of Hong Kong, also resides with him. Applicant was employed as an audit technician from
September 1996 to December 1997, and has been employed as a network engineer for a defense
contractor since January 1998. Applicant's home, value not listed, is paid-in-full. He has about
$460,000.00 deposited in U.S. banks, and $650,000.00 invested in U.S. mutual funds.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> 	Applicant worked in the computer field for the tax department of the British Hong Kong
government in Hong Kong for approximately twenty years. He retired in 1995, and receives a
pension of $4,000.00 per month from the Hong Kong government that is deposited directly into a
bank in Hong Kong. The balance in the Hong Kong account is approximately $50,000.00.
Applicant's pension payments are still deposited into the Hong Kong account, but are now
automatically transferred bimonthly to a U.S. bank. Applicant provided a statement on May 30,
2002, in which he stated he could transfer the money in this account to the U.S. whenever he wants.
He has not done so because interest rates are higher in Hong Kong than in the U.S.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant inherited a family home and around five acres of land in Hong Kong from his
father. He estimated the value of the property at approximately $1,000,000.00 in his May 2002
statement. He stated he could sell the property if he wanted, although the Chinese government
considers him only a tenant, and reserved the right to seize the property whenever it wanted. In his
SOR answer, Applicant claimed the valuation provided in that statement was an "optimistic
guesstimate." In his response to the FORM he claimed the land had no realizable value to him.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of the U.S. He has a third sister, 40
years old, who is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong, and employed by the Chinese government as
an accountant in the treasury department. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are both 81 years old,
and are also citizens and residents of Hong Kong. Applicant and his family visited their relatives in
Hong Kong while vacationing there between July 1, 1996 and August 8, 1996.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was issued a Hong Kong passport by the British on March 18, 1994 that did not
expire until March 18, 2004. However, he renounced his British National Overseas status on
September 27, 2003, and simultaneously surrendered his foreign passport. He was issued a U.S.
passport on November 28, 2001.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's Republic of
China since July 1, 1997, but enjoys a high degree of autonomy, except in areas of defense and
foreign policy, and retains its own currency, laws, and border controls. Under Chinese nationality
law, persons of Chinese descent who were born in the mainland of China or Hong Kong are Chinese
citizens. However, under an agreement between the United States and the People's Republic of
China, all U.S. citizens entering Hong Kong on their U.S. passports, including such persons as may
be considered Chinese nationals by the Chinese authorities, are considered U.S. citizens by the Hong
Kong SAR authorities for purposes of ensuring consular access and protection.<A HREF="02-27396.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Neither Applicant nor any of his relatives have been contacted by agents of the Chinese
government since he immigrated to the United States. He avers he would notify the security officer
for his employer and the FBI if any action were taken to place pressure on him through his foreign
resident relatives or assets.        </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's
eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and
Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the
Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against
clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever
a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline
B, pertaining to foreign influence, and Guideline C, pertaining to foreign preference, with their 
respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">	Foreign Influence</SPAN>. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,
including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence,
or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified
information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,
exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
