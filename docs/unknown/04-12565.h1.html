<P>Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns about alcohol abuse stemming from four alcohol-related arrests. He also failed to mitigate security concerns about 
his deliberate falsification of his security clearance application. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On July 14, 2005, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) and 
Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant timely answered the SOR, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on September 29, 2005, and I convened a hearing October 19, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented six exhibits (GE 1 through 6), which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf, and submitted one  document admitted 
without objection as Applicant's Exhibit (AE) A. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on November 1, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 34 years old and has held his current job with a defense contractor since March 2001. He works as a technician supporting satellite information 
links for forward-deployed armed forces. Applicant has held a top secret level security clearance for 14 years. He first received a clearance while serving as an 
enlisted man in the U.S. Navy between October 1989 and October 1999. He received an honorable discharge and left the service as a third class petty officer 
(paygrade E-4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been married twice. His first marriage lasted from 1991 until 1995, when he and his wife divorced. They had one child together and now share 
custody. Applicant re-married in October 2000, but that marriage also ended in divorce in 2004. Applicant's first wife regards him as a good and responsible 
father. She testified at hearing in support of Applicant, and the two appear to have a friendly, mature relationship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 1994, Applicant was stopped for running a red light. He had been drinking earlier and failed a field sobriety test. Applicant was charged with and 
eventually convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. He was assessed a fine and court costs, sentenced to 30 days in jail, and ordered to attend 
an alcohol safety awareness program (ASAP). The jail sentence was suspended, he was placed on probation for one year, and his driving privileges were 
restricted for one year.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1995, he was interviewed by a government investigator as part of an earlier security clearance background investigation. In a signed, sworn statement given 
at the interview, Applicant stated his 1994 DUI was an isolated incident, and that he would avoid driving after drinking in the future. In the same statement, he 
acknowledged having, on one occasion, consumed alcohol to the point of passing out. His level of drinking in 1995 was on the order of six or seven beers in a 
sitting twice weekly. When he was again interviewed in February 2004, Applicant indicated his alcohol consumption was generally unchanged since 1995. At 
his hearing, he stated his alcohol consumption is still the same. He regards being intoxicated as having impaired speech and motor functions, loss of memory, 
blackouts, and so forth. The last time Applicant was intoxicated according to his own definition was at a wedding in January 2004.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1995, the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON CAF), which is responsible for adjudicating security clearances for Naval 
personnel, reviewed his background, including the circumstances of his 1994 DUI. His clearance was renewed after DON CAF determined the DUI to be an 
isolated incident, which, at the time it was.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1999, while onboard a U.S. Navy warship on extended deployment, Applicant received non-judicial punishment (NJP) for unauthorized possession of 
alcohol and for being drunk on duty. He was reduced in rank from petty officer second class (paygrade E-5) to petty officer third class, restricted to the ship for 
60 days, and ordered to forfeit one-half month's pay for two months. Applicant and some shipmates had consumed mixed drinks in their berthing area. When 
he mustered for duty, a supervisor smelled alcohol on his breath and had Applicant's belongings searched, whereupon a bottle of liquor was found in 
Applicant's possession. Applicant explained he and his friends were celebrating Applicant's decision to leave the Navy. He was honorably discharged at the 
end of his obligated service in October 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2001, Applicant went to dinner with his wife and a friend. He insists he had only one alcoholic drink at dinner. After dinner, he found that his truck had 
become stuck in a sandy area (Applicant lives near a beach). As he was trying to get the vehicle back on the road, a policeman arrived and pointed out to 
Applicant a "no trespassing" sign. The officer also asked Applicant if he had been drinking, to which Applicant replied he had consumed one drink at dinner. 
The officer took Applicant into custody and charged him with public intoxication and intent to trespass. Applicant was eventually convicted of both charges and 
assessed fines and court costs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI after being stopped by a police officer. He avers he had "two or three beers over a two hour period" 
at a friend's house just before getting into his car.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant's blood alcohol content (BAC) when he was pulled over was .19%, nearly twice the legal limit in 
that jurisdiction. The charges were eventually dismissed when it was determined the police lacked probable cause to stop him in the first place.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on June 24, 2002, wherein he disclosed his 1999 NJP and his 1994 DUI. He did not disclose his 
2001 arrest for public intoxication and intent to trespass, either in response to question 24 (alcohol-related arrests/charges) or question 26 (other arrests). When 
asked about this omission by a government investigator in February 2004, he stated "I did not list these charges on my SF 86 because they either had not 
happened at the time I filled out the form or I had not yet been convicted. I was not intentionally trying to omit pertinent information or falsify the form."<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  At 
his hearing, Applicant explained his omission of the 2001 arrest as a product of either rushing through the form or confusing the requirements of questions 24 
or 26.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was faced with similar questions when he was interviewed by investigators after his first DUI in 1994. After omitting pre-USN drug use from a 
security questionnaire, he stated he thought he only had to list information from the preceding  five years.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded at work. He occupies a position of responsibility and is potentially on call around the clock to respond to emergencies and 
unplanned events. There have been no reports of misconduct at work and he has not been any adverse contacts with law enforcement since is 2003 DUI.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for an applicant to have access to classified information. 
The applicant must then present sufficient evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, 
applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion to comply with the government's compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, 
reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard 
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> for consideration when evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions listed under each adjudicative guideline as may be applicable to the 
facts and circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the 
Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific 
applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of 
access to classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are 
Guideline E (personal conduct) and  Guideline G (alcohol consumption).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern about alcohol consumption, as expressed through Guideline G, is that<STRONG> </STRONG>excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of 
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to 
carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant has been charged four times with alcohol-related offenses, and has been convicted of three of 
those charges (SOR &para;&para; 1.a - 1.d). The fourth charge (SOR &para; 1.a) was dismissed for lack of probable cause to detain Applicant in the first place. However, it is 
undisputed he had a .19% BAC at the time he was arrested. One of the charges was brought based on Applicant's drinking while in a duty status on board a 
Navy warship (SOR &para; 1.c). The government also alleged Applicant consumes alcohol to the point of intoxication at least once a year (SOR &para; 1.e). This record 
presents sufficient evidence to support these allegations and the government's preliminary decision to deny or revoke a clearance for this applicant under 
Guideline G. Specifically, disqualifying condition (DC) 1,<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 2,<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 5<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply to these facts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, this record requires consideration of Guideline G mitigating condition (MC) 2,<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 3.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's last alcohol-related arrest was more than 
two years ago, but the value of this mitigator is limited by Applicant's pattern of behavior and ongoing use of alcohol. Applicant also presented several 
character witnesses who vouched for his responsibility and reliability. While this information supports application of MC 3, Applicant's alcohol-related conduct 
occurs about every two or three years. Indeed, his last three are almost exactly two years apart. He still engages in conduct - drinking - that was the underlying 
cause for his arrests. Social drinking, even allowing for occasional intoxication, is not usually cause for concern in assessing one's suitability for a security 
clearance. But this individual has a history of alcohol-related arrests and has not thought it necessary to alter the way he uses alcohol. Absent information 
showing more definitively he is not likely to engage in excessive drinking in the future, Applicant cannot overcome the government's concerns about his use of 
alcohol. I conclude Guideline G against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has also expressed concerns about Applicant's trustworthiness through SOR allegations that he deliberately falsified his answer to SF 86 
Question 24 (alcohol-related arrests) when he failed to disclose his 2001 arrest and conviction for public intoxication (SOR &para; 2.a). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 
security concern arises where it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The record 
evidence shows Applicant did not list his arrest as alleged, but to be disqualifying, the omission must have been intentional. Applicant listed other disqualifying 
information in response to other questions, so on first glance, this omission appears to be an oversight by Applicant. However, his statement to a government 
investigator and his testimony on this point at hearing present inconsistent explanations for his omission. In light of the fact investigators confronted him with a 
similar omission when he was interviewed in 1995, there is no reason to think Applicant did not intentionally omit his 2001 arrest. At the very least, he should 
have listed this event in response to question 26 (other arrests). Having considered all of the available information relevant to this issue, I conclude Guideline E 
DC 2<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies here. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have also considered these facts in light of the Guideline E mitigating conditions. Of those potentially applicable to these facts,<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I conclude none are 
supported by this record. The omitted information was directly material to assessing Applicant's suitability for access, and the omission was recent insofar as it 
involves the SF 86 that serves as the basis for his most recent investigation. Further, Applicant has completed similar questionnaires before and there is no 
information to suggest he relied on anyone else's advice when completing the SF 86 at issue here. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step 
in requesting a security clearance. Because false or incomplete information given in the questionnaire is capable of affecting the way government investigators 
obtain complete and accurate information about an applicant, it is material. Moreover, a false answer is material even if there is no proof it actually influenced 
Applicant's background investigation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all available information on this issue, I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="04-12565.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> of the entire record before me shows the government properly expressed reasonable doubts about Applicant's suitability 
to have access to classified information. The SOR was based on sufficient, reliable information about Applicant's history of alcohol use, and about his 
willingness to be forthcoming in his statements to the government. Such issues bear directly on an applicant's ability to protect classified information, and to 
exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Available information about his current 
circumstances is not sufficient to show it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
