<P>Applicant, a 31-year-old employee of a government contractor since the age of 18, has held a security clearance for three years and was a recreational user of 
marijuana for approximately ten years before having a clearance. He was arrested twice on marijuana-related offenses in 1990 and 1998. Applicant failed to 
report these facts in 2001 on his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) fearing the loss of his job. Applicant has undergone a change of lifestyle and has shown 
a recognition  of the magnitude of his error in judgment three years ago that warrants the grant of his clearance. Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 15, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry, </EM>as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated November 12, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and admitted all of the specific allegations. 
He requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2004. A hearing was held on February 12, 2004. The Government introduced four exhibits 
at the hearing and the Applicant introduced five. All exhibits were accepted into evidence. The transcript was received on February 24, 2004. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted to all of the specific allegations as to drug use under Guideline H and the two falsification allegations under Guideline E in the SOR. The 
admitted facts are hereby incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant, a 31-year-old employee of a government contractor, who has held a security clearance for three years, was a recreational user of marijuana for 
approximately ten years before holding a security clearance. He was arrested twice on marijuana-related offenses in 1990 and 1998. Applicant failed to report 
these facts on his SF 86 when he filled it out in 2001 for fear of losing his job. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's confinement for one night on the occasion of the last arrest caused him to change his ways and he has not been a user of marijuana since then. 
Applicant encountered a difficult period in his life during a two year period between 1996 and 1998 when he separated from his wife and later was divorced. 
During that time his only child was in the care of a brother-in-law when the child was shaken and died. The brother-in-law was tried, convicted, and imprisoned 
for causing the death resulting in  disruption in the relations with the extended family. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is in a stable employment situation having worked for the same employer for the past 13 years and is highly regarded by his employer. (Attachments 
to Answer). Two civilian employees of the Department of the Army with whom Applicant works testified as to his job performance and general reputation for 
truthfulness. </P> 
 
<P>His contributions to the work of his command has been recognized by the Department of Defense. (Exh. B and C)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's employer established a drug free workplace policy in 2003 and he has agreed to abide by it.(Exh. D and E)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under the Directive the Government has alleged a number of Disqualifying Conditions (DC) These concern drug involvement including drug abuse 
(E2.A8.1.2.1.) and illegal possession (E2.A8.1.2.2.) under Guideline H. Also alleged is falsification of his SF 86 by failing to disclose the drug use and his two 
arrests (E2.A5.1.2.2) under Guideline E. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The government has cited Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline H in the SOR concerning drug involvement as relevant to the proposed denial of a 
security clearance for the Applicant. Drug involvement is always a security concern because it raises questions about a person's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Any drug abuse is a condition that may be disqualifying. E2.A8.1.1.3 provides the following definition: "Drug abuse is the illegal use of 
a drug . . . ." </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has shown an ability to recover from the drug problem he had six years ago and has become a stable member of society. He has remarried and has 
two small children. Mitigating Condition (MC) 3 is applicable since there is a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. Also applicable is (MC) 
1 in that the drug involvement was not recent. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>With regard to Guideline E, Applicant did not disclose his drug use and the two arrests in 1990 and 1998 and the confinement for one night in 1998 on his SF 
86. Thus, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 2 is applicable in that he deliberately omitted relevant and material facts from his SF 86. He candidly admitted the 
omissions were deliberate in an effort to prevent the loss of his employment. He knows it was a very bad decision on his part. He failed to report the conduct 
when he panicked at the thought of losing his job. He is contrite about his conduct and comprehends the gravity of his actions. He candidly admitted the facts 
surrounding his omissions in an honest and forthright manner. While no specific mitigating conditions are applicable the matter deserves further analysis. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </P> 
 
<P>The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applying the standards set for the 
Directive for application of the whole person analysis (E2.2.1.) I conclude that he meets the test established by the whole person standard. While the nature of 
the offense was serious and he deliberately withheld information for a reason that is not acceptable, the act occurred once three years ago when he was in his 
twenties after an emotional and traumatic period in his life. There have been behavioral changes since then and the potential for coercion, exploitation or duress 
has been eliminated since his conduct has changed and his employer knows of the problems created by his conduct. Most importantly, the likelihood of 
continuance or recurrence of either the drug use or falsification of information has been eliminated. Having heard his testimony and observed him, I believe 
there is no likelihood of a recurrence of similar conduct. </P> 
 
<P>After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that the Applicant is a 
trustworthy and reliable person whose record of good conduct over the past six years and employment stability for the past 13 years justifies a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to him. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline H:    FOR APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:     For Applicant</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>After full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.</P>
