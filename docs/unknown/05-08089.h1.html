<P>Applicant is 29 years old, unmarried, and has a son whom he supports.  He works for a defense contractor.  He admits his 11-year marijuana use, sale,

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On January 17, 2006, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="05-08089.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 2, 2006.  Applicant requested his case be 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
<P>On March 15, 2006, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to 
the Applicant.  He was given  the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant filed a response to the 
FORM on April 12, 2006, within the 30 day time allowed.  The case was assigned to me on April 20, 2006. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 29 years old, unmarried, and works for a defense contractor.  He has a son whom he supports. (Items 4, 5)</P> 
<P>Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from at least 1992 until at least 1999.  His usage may have been daily during certain times within this period, 
particularly from 1993 to 1997.  From October 1997 to December 1999 he used marijuana about 300 times.  Applicant also purchased marijuana from some 
time in 1996 until December 1999.  He also sold it from December 1999 to at least June 2003.  In 1993 the police department in his hometown detained him for 
possession of marijuana.  Between 1993 and June 2003, at various times, he planted and cultivated marijuana plants at his home, in different quantities.  For 
example, in 1993 or 1994 his local police department confiscated two marijuana plants from his home. (Items 1 and 3; FORM Response)</P> 
<P>Sometime in 1993 Applicant received a citation from a state park ranger for having an open container of alcohol in a state park.  Applicant's punishment was 
performance of community service. (Items 1 and 3, FORM Response)  On the SCA Question 24 asked if he had ever been charged with or convicted on any 
alcohol or drug related offenses, he answered "no."Applicant did not disclose this citation on his security clearance application (SCA) dated September 22, 
2004, but it was a mistake and not deliberate because the offense was minor, a decade earlier, and he did not go to court on the charge. (Item 3, FORM 
Response)  </P> 
<P>On his 2004 SCA, Applicant answered Question 27 regarding the use in the past seven years of any illegal substance with a "yes" and stated he used marijuana 
about 300 times from 1994 to December 31, 1999.  He did not disclose any marijuana use prior to 1994.  The seven year period referred to in the question was 
from September 1997 to September 2004. (Items 1, 3, 4; FORM Response)</P> 
<P>Applicant disclosed on the October 2, 2003, SCA to Question 27 about his illegal drug use in the past seven years (the period October 1996 to October 2003) 
that he used marijuana about 20 times between September 1997 and December 31, 1999, having answered "yes".  He did not disclose any use prior to 
September 1997. (Items 1, 3, 5, FORM Response)</P> 
<P>Applicant did not disclose in answer to Question 29 of the October 2, 2003, SCA that he was involved in the illegal purchase, manufacture, trafficking, 
production, transfer, shipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, or cannabis for his own use.  Specifically, he did not 
disclose his several incidents between 1993 and 2003 of cultivating marijuana plants, which activity is prohibited by state and federal laws.  Nor did he disclose 
he sold</P> 
<P>marijuana during 1999 to 2003, and purchased marijuana from 1996 through 1999.  Deliberate falsification of information on a SCA is a felony offense under 
18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. (Items 1, 3, 5; FORM Response)</P> 
<P>Applicant submitted three character statements attesting to his competent work and ability to handle classified material.  He complied with the rules and 
procedures of his workplace.  He is regarded highly by his coworkers who wrote the letters.  Applicant has had an interim clearance for the past 18 months.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding 
Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. 
ay 2, 1996).  All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an 
applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 
00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden 
shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H: Drug Involvement: <EM>The Concern. Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to 
protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information. E2.A8.1.1</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E: Personal Conduct: <EM>The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </EM>E2.A5.1.1</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J: Criminal Conduct: <EM>The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness</EM>. 
E2.A10.1.1</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR, except that in subparagraph 2.b. and subparagraph 3.c. as it referenced subparagraph 2.b.  The admitted 
allegations create a picture of Applicant as a person using marijuana over an 11-year period who admitted he falsified his 2003 SCA in certain particular 
questions, and whose involvement with marijuana was in continuous violation of state and federal anti-drug laws.  The specific security concerns are discussed 
in the succeeding paragraphs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Applicant's drug involvement under Guideline H, the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) applicable to these facts are DC 1 (any drug abuse, defined as 
the illegal use of a drug. E2.A8.1.2.1 and E2.A8.1.1.3) and DC 2 (Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or 
distribution. E2.A8.1.2.2).  Over the 11-year period of involvement with marijuana, Applicant grew and cultivated it, bought and sold it, and used it, sometimes 
daily, and other times weekly or monthly.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) in the guideline apply to Applicant's situation.  His marijuana involvement ceased only recently compared to the time 
he spent in that activity.  While he expresses a desire not to return to that lifestyle in his Answer, he does admit further that he did it to raise money to provide 
for his son and to obtain an education for himself.  But he submitted no other evidence that he has separated himself from those activities, and his declaration is 
not persuasive.  The burden of proof and persuasion on the applicability of the MC are upon Applicant under each guideline.  Here he has not met that burden.  
I conclude this security concern against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The personal conduct is the alleged deliberate falsification of answers on his two SCAs and the illegal course of conduct he engaged in by using marijuana from 
1992 to 2003.  He admits some falsifications on both SCAs, but claims some were mistakes, not deliberate, and finally that some were deliberate.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He did not disclose his open alcohol container citation from 1993, claiming he forgot about it.  I am not sure an open container violation is a criminal offense 
that would be arrested.  There is no evidence he was charged, or convicted or just cited as a juvenile and told to perform some community service.  He admitted 
the falsifications in 2.c and 2.d, so there is no reason he would deny he lied about this insignificant charge.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Next, he disclosed on his 2003 SCA, in answer to Question 27, only 20 uses of marijuana from September 1997 to December 31, 1999.  On the 2003 SCA he 
did not disclose his sale, purchase, and cultivation of marijuana in answering Question 29.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the 2004 SCA he disclosed more than 300 uses of marijuana between January 1994 and December 1999.  But Question 27 on the 2004 SCA only asked 
about a seven year period from 2004 back to 1997, so he disclosed more than he was asked and more than he did on the 2003 SCA.  The Government alleges he 
should have disclosed almost daily use from 1992 to December 1999.  On the 2004 SCA he disclosed he cultivated, sold, and purchased marijuana when he 
answered Question 29 with a "yes".</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2 (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, or similar form used to 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness E2.A5.1.2.2), DC 4 (Personal conduct that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the 
person susceptible to blackmail. E2.A5.1.2.4), DC 5 (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. E2.A5.1.2.5), and DC 6 (Association with persons involved in 
criminal activity. E2.A5.1.2.6) apply.  Considering all of the evidence submitted to me, I conclude Applicant deliberately falsified his Answer to Question 29 on 
the 2003 SCA by not disclosing his cultivation, sale, and purchase of marijuana over several years.  I also conclude Applicant's course of conduct over those 
years as alleged in SOR Paragraph 1 is personal conduct that displays questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, and dishonesty.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Mitigating Conditions under the personal conduct security concern, MC 5 (The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or 
eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. E2.A5.1.3.5) and MC 7 (Association with persons involved in criminal activities has ceased. 
E2.A5.1.3.7) apply here on certain falsification allegations, those in subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. because Applicant had met his burden of proof and persuasion 
on those allegations.  I conclude he did not deliberately falsify subparagraph 2.a. because it was not recent and so insignificant he forgot about it, so he only 
made a mistake.  On subparagraph 2.b. he disclosed material uses of marijuana beyond the seven-year period Question 27 requested, so there was no deliberate 
falsification there.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In contrast to these allegations, Applicant admitted his deliberate falsification as alleged in subparagraph 2.c., so I conclude that allegation against him.  He also 
admitted his deliberate falsification on Question 29 on the 2003 SCA regarding his sale, cultivation, and purchase of marijuana.  I conclude this allegation in 
subparagraph 2.d. against him.  His cessation of drug related activities removes him from persons involved in such criminal activities, but that MC 7 alone does 
not overcome the magnitude of his actions as alleged in subparagraph 2.e.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, the criminal conduct security concern has DC 1 (allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged. 
E2.A10.1.2.1) and DC 2 (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. E2.A10.1.2.2) being applicable.  Applicant admits his criminal activities involving 
drug abuse. Isn't 3.b the same as part of 3.c? What about discussing SOR &para; 3c concerning 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No MC apply to Applicant's criminal activity.  Therefore, I conclude this security concern against him.</SPAN></P>
