<P>Although his family ties to Ethiopia raise a security concern, Applicant has successfully mitigated the concern because the totality of the circumstances show 
his family ties do not pose an unacceptable risk or concern of foreign influence.  Additionally, Applicant has worked in the defense industry since 1998 and 
held a security clearance for eight years establishing a proven track record of trust and responsibility.  Applicant also mitigated a minor security violations 
concern following a single incident in 2001.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 13, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-24243.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), Guideline K (Security 
Violations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 3, 2004, and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 9, 2005, the hearing office received the case file and it was assigned to another administrative judge on the same day.  On March 10, 2005, DOHA 
issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on April 5, 2005.  Due to caseload considerations, the case was reassigned to me on April 1, 2005.  
The case was conducted as originally scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented five exhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, without objection.  Applicant presented 
26 exhibits, which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through Z, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on April 19, 
2005.  By letter dated April 26, 2005, Applicant's counsel submitted an errata sheet correcting errors in the transcript, without objection.</SPAN></P>

was a member of The Bulldog Den Club, a social club sponsored by the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, which offered students the opportunity to study English 
and to learn about the U.S.  Tr. 24, AE A.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the time Applicant graduated from high school, Ethiopia was a communist country.  Options to pursue higher education were limited and administered 
through the Consul for Higher Education.  Consequently, Applicant was allowed to pursue his education in the Soviet Union where he studied in Moscow, 
oldavia, and Odessa.  Tr. 25.  While in Odessa, he was granted permission to visit West Berlin, once there, he defected, sought and was granted asylum in 
Germany.  Tr. 25-26.  From Germany Applicant successfully enlisted the aid of a church organization in the U.S., who sponsored him to study in the U.S.  Tr. 
27.  AE D, AE F. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in August 1988.  GE 1.  After arriving in the U.S., Applicant pursued his studies and was awarded a bachelor of science 
degree in biomedical engineering in June 1996, a master of science degree in electrical engineering specializing in digital signal processing in June 1998, a 
master of science degree in engineering in December 2002, and is currently working towards his Ph.D. part-time in electrical engineering.  Tr. 54-56, AE M. </SPAN></P>

citizen, from October 1997 to November 2001.  That marriage ended in divorce.  GE 1.  Applicant has remarried and has a one-year-old child with his second 
wife.  His wife is studying nursing at a local community college.  Tr. 42.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to Applicant's wife and child, his immediate family consists of his mother, father, three brothers, and one sister.  His mother is a resident alien living 
in the U.S. since May 1999.  Her application for U.S. citizenship is pending.  Tr. 29.  Applicant's father is a citizen resident of Ethiopia.  He has a pending 
application to become a resident alien of the U.S.  Tr. 34, 48.  Applicant's sister is a resident alien living in the U.S. since March 2004.  She intends to apply for 
U.S. citizenship when eligible.  Tr. 29, 51, GE 1.  Applicant has one brother, who has been a resident alien living in the U.S. since April 2005.  Tr. 30-31, 33-34, 52, GE 1.

alien of the U.S., and the other brother intends to become a resident alien as soon as practicable.  Tr. 29, 51, GE 1.  None of Applicant's immediate family 
members living in the U.S. or those remaining in Ethiopia have ever been affiliated with the Ethiopian government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since September 2002, Applicant has been employed as a senior radar engineer for a defense contractor.  He has held a secret security clearance since 
September 1998, which he acquired while working as an engineer for his previous defense contractor employer.  He seeks to renew his clearance.  Tr. 53.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While employed with his previous employer, Applicant was involved in a minor incident involving mishandling classified material.  In July 2001, some 
classified material signed out to Applicant was discovered on top of a common safe located in a secure computer room.  Applicant and a co-worker were 
working on a project and were sharing the classified material.  Applicant left the secure computer room to answer a telephone call and upon his return a co-worker discovered the classified material in question on top of a safe.  An informal investigation revealed there was no compromise of classified information 
and Applicant was informally counseled.  Tr. 39-41, 47, Answer to SOR, GE 3.  No further security breaches are documented in the record.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has limited contact with his immediate family members living in Ethiopia.  Tr. 34-35.  He has letter contact with his father approximately once a year 
and telephonic contact approximately four times a year, usually around holidays.  GE 2.  Applicant sent money to his family in Ethiopia in the amounts of 
$50.00 to $100.00 per month from 2001 to 2003 to pay for his sister's medical bills and for his brother's college tuition.  He no longer sends money.  Tr. 35-36, 
AE K, AE L.  Applicant traveled to Ethiopia to visit his family in August 1997 and August 2000.  Tr. 38, GE 2.  Applicant does not own property in Ethiopia 
nor does he have any financial interests in Ethiopia.  Tr. 38-39.  Applicant's family members in Ethiopia are apolitical and are not subject to any persecution by 
any political faction.  Tr. 44.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation at work, has a strong work ethic, and is making a significant contribution to the defense industry.  His supervisors state 
his character is above reproach and fully endorse his being granted a security clearance.  Tr. 57-77, AE T through Y.  He is an avid runner and he and his wife 
regularly attend church.  Tr. 42.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel submitted two documents published by the U.S. State Department on Ethiopia.  The first is titled "Background Note: Ethiopia," originated 
by the Bureau of African Affairs," January 2005.  The second is titled "Ethiopia, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2003, released by the Bureau of 
Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, February 25, 2004.  GE 4, GE 5.  Applicant also submitted a document published by the U.S. State Department that is a 
Consular Information Sheet titled "Ethiopia," August 11, 2005.  AE Z.  GE 5.  The evidence illustrates despite progress made in the area of human rights, there 
still remains room for considerable improvement.  However, no evidence was offered nor was there any suggestion that links Applicant's remaining family 
members in Ethiopia to any form of human rights abuse. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, administrative judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's father and four siblings are resident citizens of Ethiopia (&para; 1.a); that Applicant has telephonic contact with his relatives 
in Ethiopia about four times yearly and contact by letter about once yearly (&para; 1.b); that Applicant was actively working to sponsor his two Ethiopian brothers to 
the U.S. (&para; 1.c.); that Applicant sent $100.00 monthly from 1999 to January 2003 to his family in Ethiopia (&para; 1.d.); that Applicant traveled to Ethiopia in 1997 
and again in 2000 to visit family members (&para; 1.e.); and that the Ethiopian government sponsored his education and selected his area of study (&para; 1.f.).  <EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to 
security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR-Applicant has immediate family members 
who are citizen residents of a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  However, some of the information alleged in the SOR under this concern has changed and is 
discussed below.  The government amended the SOR to reflect these changes at the conclusion of the hearing.  Tr. 78-81.  While the</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law,</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or 
mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb 8, 2001).  It is a mitigating condition if the immediate family members or associates 
are not agents of a foreign power  and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to his family members and loyalty to the United States.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not an exact science.  Instead, they are predictive judgments about an Applicant's security suitability in light of that person's 
past conduct and <EM>present circumstances.  Egan, </EM>484 U.S. at 528-29.  Applicant is a loyal U.S. citizen, enjoys the rights and privileges of being a U.S. citizen 
resident, and has established an excellent record of being a valued and trusted employee of a defense contractor.  Since  the SOR was issued, two of his siblings 
have relocated to the U.S., leaving his father and two brothers in Ethiopia.  One of his brothers lives with his father and the remaining brother lives on his own.  
Efforts are being made for Applicant's three remaining family members living in Ethiopia to immigrate to the U.S.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is also noteworthy Appellant has worked in the defense industry since 1998 and has held a security clearance.  His employer and colleagues, who work with 
him on a daily basis, strongly endorse his having a security clearance.  They emphasized his past and projected contributions to the defense industry.  In short, 
Applicant has a proven track record of loyalty and trust to his employer and the United States.  Applicant's connections to or contacts with Ethiopia are rather 
minimal or insignificant when compared with his significant connections to the U.S.  Applicant's connections to or contacts with Ethiopia, as alleged in the 
SOR, and subsequently amended, and based on the record evidence as a whole, do not pose an unacceptable security risk or concern for foreign influence.  
Under the totality of circumstances, I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline K - Security Violations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged in July 2001 Applicant had failed to secure classified material in an authorized manner (&para; 2.a.).  Noncompliance with security 
regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.  Directive E2.A11.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admission the allegations in the SOR - Applicant failed to secure classified material in an 
authorized manner.  The pertinent disqualifying condition under this concern is a violation due to negligence.  E2.A11.1.2.2.  This was an isolated incident and 
relatively minor in nature.  In July 2001, Applicant checked out a classified document he was working on with a co-worker.  When distracted to answer a 
telephone call, he left his secure area and while gone, the document in question was discovered on top of the safe.  Applicant does not recall whether he or his 
partner was reviewing the document, but since the document was signed out to him, he was responsible for it.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An informal investigation determined there was no compromise of classified information and Applicant was informally counseled.  There have been no further 
incidents of this nature since this event occurred over four years ago.  Applicant accepted responsibility for his actions and has a positive attitude about 
maintaining security.  This act was inadvertent, was an isolated infrequent occurrence, and Applicant has a positive attitude towards the discharge of security 
responsibilities.  Directive &para;&para; E2.A11.1.3.1., E2.A11.1.3.2., and E2.A11.1.3.4.  I find for Applicant on this concern.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR allegation under this concern repeated the identical security incident under Guideline K - Security Violations and is considered multiplicious.  The 
discussion above adequately addresses this incident.  Therefore, no further discussion is warranted.  I find for Applicant on this concern.</SPAN></P>
