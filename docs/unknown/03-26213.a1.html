<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On March 3, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 23, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge 
James A. Young denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline F had 
not been mitigated.<A HREF="03-26213.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised by his history of financial difficulties had not been 
mitigated.  In support of that contention, Applicant essentially reargues his case with respect to the limited evidence he presented below and also argues that the 
Judge erred with respect to his findings.  The Board does not find Applicant's contention persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The findings which Applicant challenges are permissible characterizations by the Administrative Judge.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating 
that the Administrative Judge's material findings with respect to Applicant's conduct of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation 
of the record evidence.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's material findings<A HREF="03-26213.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> of security concern are sustainable. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial obligations.  At the time the case was submitted for 
decision, Applicant still had significant outstanding debts.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Applicant's financial problems 
were still ongoing.  Moreover, the Board has previously noted that it is reasonable to expect applicants to have documentation about efforts to satisfy specific 
debts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-23511 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and 
seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant 
with respect to several of the factual allegations.  However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not fully applying any mitigating conditions in this case, 
and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  
The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Administrative Judge's 
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. June 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him, 
the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines F is sustainable.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a 
clearance.</SPAN></P>
