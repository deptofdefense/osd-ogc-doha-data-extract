<P>The Applicant has not shown a present ability to resolve his indebtedness in a reasonable period of time.  He has also not shown that the past due indebtedness 
was due largely to his divorce.  He did show that he did not falsify a questionnaire concerning his debt situation.  All things considered, the Applicant has not

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 2, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 27, 2005, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on July 5, 2005, and a 
Notice of Hearing was issued on July 28, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on August 17, 2005, at which the Government presented five  documentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also 
submitted three hearing exhibits.  He subsequently submitted three post-hearing exhibits.  Applicant's Exhibit D consists of an additional written statement of 
the Applicant and divorce records.  Applicant's Exhibit E consists of payment receipts from creditors.  Applicant's Exhibit F is a written statement from the 
Applicant's employer.  The transcript was received on September 6, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 27, married and has a GED.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Dispatcher, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and 
the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial irresponsibility)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance in that he is financially 
overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to obtain funds.  The Applicant admitted all the allegations under this paragraph.  Those 
admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has had severe financial difficulties for several years.  His financial situation, while improving, is still not good.  The Applicant's first wife, from 
whom he is now divorced, admitted in writing that she opened accounts and ran up bills without his knowledge.  (Applicant's Exhibit A.)  The Applicant 
allowed his ex-wife to run the finances and he trusted her to pay the bills on time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2004, the Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service.  At this time, he was shown a copy of his credit report.  He 
acknowledged that the debts were incurred during his marriage.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  When the Applicant and his ex-wife were divorced, their petition 
states the following with regard to their debts, "We are keeping whatever debts are on our credit."  (Applicant's Exhibit D at 4.)  The Applicant and his ex-wife 
were divorced in September 2003.  (Applicant's Exhibit D at 7.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has begun to resolve his debts.  He has remarried and, with the addition of his new wife's pay, is in a better position to pay off his debts.  
(Transcript at 47-50.)  His actions are set forth below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant has paid off this past due medical bill in the amount of $76.72.  (Applicant's Exhibit E at 1.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits owing this past due debt for telephone services in the amount of $167 since 2000.  He has not contacted this creditor 
because he was unable to find contact information.  He will contact this creditor and determine whether the debt is his.  If it is, he will pay it.  (Transcript at 27-31.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits owing this past due debt for a credit card in the amount of $833 since January 2001.  He has not yet contacted this 
creditor for two reasons.  First, there is some indication that this debt may have been sold to another company and the Applicant needs to find out who actually 
owns this debt.  Second, he wants to wait on sending a letter to this creditor until he is in a better position to pay them.  (Transcript at 31-32.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits owing this past due debt in the amount of $242 since January 2001.  He has not yet contacted this creditor for two 
reasons.  First, there is some indication that this debt may have been sold to another company and the Applicant needs to find out who actually owns this debt.  
Second, he wants to argue with this creditor that the debt is actually his ex-wife's.  If the Applicant does owe the debt, he intends to pay it off in one lump sum. 
(Transcript at 32-34.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant admits owing this past due debt in the amount of $6,845 for an automobile repossessed in February 2001.  He has not yet 
contacted this creditor.  When he does, the Applicant wants to try and negotiate a payment arrangement where he only has to pay half the debt, since it was 
incurred during his first marriage.  In any event, he will make payments on this debt.  (Transcript at 35-37.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant admitted in his Answer owing this past due debt for a bad check in the amount of $32 since 2001.  At the hearing, the 
Applicant testified that he has not paid this debt and is confused as to whether he owes this debt at all.  If it is proven to be his debt, the Applicant will pay it.  
(Transcript at 39.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.g.  The Applicant admits owing this past due debt in the amount of $1,678 for a credit card since March 2001.  He has not yet contacted this 
creditor, but intends on paying off this debt.  (Transcript at 39-40.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.h.  The Applicant admits owing this past due debt in the amount of $3,638  for an automobile repossessed in February 2001.  He has not yet 
contacted this creditor.  When he does, the Applicant wants to try and negotiate a payment arrangement where he only has to pay half the debt, since it was 
incurred during his first marriage.  In any event, he will make payments on this debt.  (Transcript at 40-41.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.i.  The Applicant admits owing this past due debt in the amount of $633  for a credit card since June 2001.  He has not yet contacted this 
creditor.  When he does, he will make payments on this debt.  (Transcript at 35-37.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.j.  The Applicant paid this debt in the amount of $53.65 for cable television services in August 2005.  (Applicant's Exhibit E at 2-3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.k.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of $445 since July 2002.  He has not yet contacted this creditor and hopes to settle this 
account for a lesser amount.  (Transcript at 43-45.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.l.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of $102 since June 2003.  He has contacted this creditor and hopes to settle this account 
as soon as they contact him.  (Transcript at 45.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.m.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of $1,019 for a credit card since September 2003.  He has not yet contacted this 
creditor and hopes to settle this account once he has paid off the smaller debts.  (Transcript at 45-46.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.n.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of $451 since September 2003.  He has not yet contacted this creditor and hopes to 
settle this account for a lesser amount.  (Transcript at 46.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.o.  The Applicant admits owing this debt in the amount of $444 for telephone service.  He has not yet contacted this creditor and hopes to settle 
this account for a lesser amount.  (Transcript at 47.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 9, 2004, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that he had not been more than 180 days delinquent on any debts 
within the last seven years.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 38.)  He further stated that he was not currently 90 days delinquent on any debts as of the date of 
the questionnaire.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 39.) Finally, he also stated that he had never had any property repossessed for any reason.  (Government 
Exhibit 1 at question 35.)  All of these statements were false answers to material questions pertaining to the Applicant's financial and debt situation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, at question 43 of Government Exhibit 1, "General Remarks," the Applicant stated, "Also all credit related items were marked NO due to them being 
caused by my 'soon to be' ex-wife.  I have not had my credit ran in so long I have no idea what repo's or delinquenc[i]es I have."  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that he had no intent to deceive the Government when he originally filled out the form and answered questions 35, 38 and 39 "Yes."  He 
did not have specific information concerning his debts, and the form was returned to him by his company security manager.  While he filled out a questionnaire 
by hand, the final version would be the Electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire.  (Transcript at 50-53.)  The Applicant informed the security manager that 
he did not know specifics about his debts and testified, "She said that what you have to do then is put no, because when they do the investigation they check 
anyway, and they'll come to you on it if they have questions.  So just put something in the remarks section of the clearance request form that you may have 
something but you don't know, and then put why, and that's what I did."  (Transcript at 51.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.  The Applicant's employer submitted a letter in which it is stated, "[The Applicant] has been an outstanding associate with numerous 
commendations from his superiors."  (Applicant's Exhibit F at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case set forth 
under <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN>, below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of falsification and criminal conduct, as well as financial irresponsibility, that demonstrates poor judgement, 
untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant is financially overextended, and does not yet have 
his finances under control (Guideline F).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.  Turning to Paragraphs 2 and 3, I find that the Government has failed to make its initial burden.  The evidence 
shows that the Applicant notified the Government as best he could that he had financial problems.  Given his divorce and the problems with his now ex-wife, he 
could not know the true extent of his debts.  The electronic version of the Personnel Security Questionnaire requires considerable information concerning a 
person's bad debts in order to be validated, information which he did not have.  Under the whole person standard, and considering the state of the evidence, I 
find that the Applicant did not have the intent to deceive the Government.  Guidelines E and J are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The situation is different when it comes to his financial situation.  The Applicant admits owing $16,710.  He stated at the hearing that his ex-wife may be 
responsible for some of the debt, a fact which she admits, but he is unable to state with particularity what debts she is responsible for.  He submitted evidence 
showing that he has paid two debts worth $129.  This is less than 10% of the total amount owed.  He has not contacted all of his creditors as of yet, and he has 
no specific plan for paying them off.  While he has shown the beginnings of a good-faith effort to resolve his indebtedness, it is simply too soon in the process 
to have confidence that he will be able to complete it.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the facts of this case, Disqualifying Conditions E3.A6.1.2.1. <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM> and E3.A6.1.2.3. <EM>Inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts</EM> apply.  The behavior is recent, in that the debts are long-standing and continue to be unpaid.  In addition, they are not isolated.  I have considered 
the Applicant's separation and divorce in analyzing this case.  However, I do not believe that, <EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond 
the person's control</EM>.  (Mitigating Condition E2.A6.1.3.3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's efforts at reform are noted, and he is commended for his decision to pay off his debts as soon as possible.  If he continues to show the ability to 
maintain his current debt situation and pay off his past indebtedness, he may be eligible for a clearance in the future.  Under the particular circumstances of this 
case, this evidence does not overcome the adverse information that has been presented by the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  
As set forth above, Paragraphs 2 and 3 are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
