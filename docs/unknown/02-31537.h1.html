<P>Applicant's illegal use of marijuana from 1990 until 1994, and again in July 2002, has not been mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On August 11, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 27, 2003, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted  the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on October 27, 2003.  The Applicant was instructed to 
submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on October 31, 2003, and did not submit a 
reply.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on December 11, 2003. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is 30 years old and unmarried.  He is employed as a Systems Engineer by a defense contractor and is applying for a security clearance in 
connection with his employment.</P> 
 
<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has abused illegal substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant used marijuana from 1990 until 1994 at least two times, at parties with friends.  He last used it in July 2002.  In a statement he provided to the 
Defense Security Service, in August 2002, he stated that if someone offers him some marijuana at a party in the future, he might possibly use it.  He further 
states that if his employer told him that he was constrained from using marijuana, he would choose not to use it.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government Exhibit 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In his response to the SOR, the Applicant states that his past use of marijuana was a mistake and attributed it to the process of growing up.  (<EM>See</EM>, Government 
Exhibit 3).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his conduct shows poor judgment, 
unreliability or untrustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's illegal drug use set forth above, and the Applicant possible intent to use it in the future.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline H (Drug Involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. any drug abuse;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>4.  Personal Conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known may affect the person's personal , professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail;</P> 
 
<P>6.  Association with persons involved in criminal activity.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</P> 
 
<P> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P> 
 
<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of drug abuse and poor personal conduct which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</P> 
 
<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant engaged in drug abuse (Guideline H) and poor personal conduct (Guideline 
E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's 
conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has failed to introduce persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome 
the Government's case.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's history of drug abuse, from 1990 until 1994, and again in July 2002, at parties with friends, although intermittent, and not frequent, shows 
extremely poor judgment on his part.  The fact that he may possibly use it in the future also shows poor judgment.  There is no evidence of a demonstrated 
intent that he will not use marijuana in the future.  None of the mitigating factors apply under either Guidelines H or E.  Drug abuse is illegal, and the Applicant 
knew or should know that it is, and that it is clearly prohibited by the Department of Defense.  The Applicant's drug use was not isolated, but extended over a 
period of several years, and may continue in the future.  Accordingly, under the particular facts of this case, I am given no other choice than to find against the 
Applicant under Guideline H, (Drug Abuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  </P> 
 
<P>On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement 
of Reasons.     </P>
