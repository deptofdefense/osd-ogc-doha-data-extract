<P>Applicant, a 34-year-old native of India, became a naturalized citizen of Australia, married a U.S. citizen, immigrated to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen.  
Applicant successfully refuted foreign preference and mitigated foreign influence personnel security guideline concerns.  Applicant demonstrated it is in the 
national interest to grant him a clearance.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor, applied for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), the federal agency 
tasked with determining an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information, declined to grant Applicant a clearance.  In accordance with the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-16085.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-16085.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 2 January 2003 detailing why a clearance was not 
granted and recommending Applicant's case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether the clearance should be denied/revoked.  In the SOR, 
DOHA alleged Applicant failed to meet the foreign preference (Guideline C) and foreign influence (Guideline B) personnel security guidelines. </P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 17 January 2003.  The case was assigned to me on 10 February 2003.  On 21 March 2003, I convened a hearing to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of three exhibits 
(1a, 1b, and 2).  Applicant testified on his own behalf, called two witnesses to testify, and submitted 7 exhibits at the hearing in addition to the exhibit attached 
to his answer.  A transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on 31 March 2003.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.  Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 2.  <EM>See </EM>Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. May 9, 
2001).  Once the Government has established a prima facie case by substantial evidence<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate the facts.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is 
clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See </EM>Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C-Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline C that Applicant had a preference for a foreign country over the U.S. by exercising dual citizenship with Australia 
and possessing both Indian and Australian passports. </P> 
<P>Under Guideline C, w<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, he may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive &para; E2.A3 .1.1.  The Government alleged the following applicable 
conditions raise a security concern in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) The exercise of dual citizenship.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The fact that the indicators of foreign preference occurred before Applicant obtained U.S. citizenship is an applicable mitigating factor.  Directive &para; 
E2.A3.1.3.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence of record clearly demonstrates that Applicant has not exercised dual citizenship with the United States and Australia and does not possess a valid 
passport from either India or Australia.  Finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline B that Applicant was subject to foreign influence because his parents, some of his siblings, and his mother-in-law 
are not citizens of the U.S. and that some of them reside in countries other than the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an 
individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  It is a security concern that may be disqualifying when an 
immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.2.l.  Such security concerns may be mitigated by a finding that the immediate family members are not agents of a foreign power or 
in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.  
Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.l.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence that members of Applicant's immediate family are not citizens or residents of the U.S.  Nevertheless, 
Applicant successfully mitigated those security concerns.  These family members are not agents of a foreign power and Applicant is not in a position to be 
exploited by them.  The U.S. is his home and he intends to live and die in this country.  Tr.  91.  He understands his duties and will report any overtures to the 
appropriate authorities.  After observing and hearing Applicant, I am convinced that his family members do not represent a credible security risk to this nation.  
Finding is for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
