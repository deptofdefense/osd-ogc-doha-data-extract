  The minor faulty findings of fact identified by Applicant on appeal do not warrant remand or reversal because correction of those errors would not reasonably be likely to change the outcome of the case.  Given the Judge's sustainable findings of fact about Applicant's ties with immediate family members in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude security concerns were raised under Guideline B.  Considering the record as a  whole, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his burden of presenting sufficient evidence to mitigate the  security concerns raised under Guideline B.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated May 6, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C 
(Foreign Preference).  Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated June 29, 2005.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred in making certain factual findings, and (2) whether the 
Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) had not been mitigated.  For the reasons that 
follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in making certain factual findings</SPAN>.  Applicant contends that the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance 
decision should be reversed because it is predicated on several minor faulty findings of fact.<A HREF="03-06267.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board does not find Applicant's contention persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The factual errors which Applicant alleges<A HREF="03-06267.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> would not be reasonably likely to change the outcome of the case.  Applicant has not met his burden of 
demonstrating that the Administrative Judge's material findings with respect Applicant's foreign family members do not reflect a reasonable or plausible 
interpretation of the record evidence.  As noted above, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's 
material findings of security concern are sustainable.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) had not been mitigated</SPAN>.  
Applicant argues that the evidence he provided in the proceeding below was sufficient to require the Administrative Judge to conclude that he had rebutted, 
mitigated or extenuated the security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Specifically, Applicant contends that the Judge's adverse decision 
should be reversed because the Judge: (1) misapplied Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition 1,<A HREF="03-06267.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> (2) failed to consider mitigating evidence, and (3) made an 
unfavorable decision that is unsupported by the record as a whole.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate 
the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that: (1) Applicant's father and mother are citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina residing in that country, (2) 
Applicant maintains contact with his father and mother through video teleconferencing several times a month, (3) Applicant had traveled to Bosnia-Herzegovina between 1999 and 2001 to visit his parents, and (4) Applicant's father had been a high-level official in the Bosnian government and a major 
government-held corporation.  Given those findings, the Judge concluded that Applicant's ties with his immediate family members raised security concerns 
under Guideline B and that Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition 1<A HREF="03-06267.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> applied.  That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also contends that the Administrative Judge gave insufficient weight to evidence that: (1) Applicant's parents in Bosnia-Herzegovina were now 
retired and were not agents of the Bosnian government, and (2) Bosnia-Herzegovina was not hostile to the United States.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that, even assuming none of Applicant's family members were agents of the Bosnian government, Applicant still had the 
burden of demonstrating that his family members in Bosnia-Herzegovina were not in positions where they are likely to be exploited by a foreign power.  
Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that it was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant had not 
met his burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  As noted above, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo.</EM>  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge 
considered all the record evidence unless he or she specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  The mere 
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate error without a showing that the Judge's weighing of the evidence was 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>The absence of evidence that Applicant's family members in Bosnia-Herzegovina are currently employees or agents of the Bosnian government is not 
dispositive.  Having relatives, cohabitants, or associates who are connected with a foreign government is a disqualifying condition under Guideline B.<A HREF="03-06267.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  
However, the absence of such a connection with a foreign government does not mean that there is no security concern under Guideline B.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case 
No. 02-29665 (November 10, 2004) at p.5.  A reading of Guideline B in its entirety shows that security concerns can be raised by a variety of foreign 
connections, not just having family members with foreign government connections.  Moreover, the Board has previously rejected the premise that security 
concerns under Guideline B are mitigated merely because an applicant's foreign family members are elderly or retired.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-04786 
(June 27, 2003) at p. 5 (Administrative Judge failed to articulate a rational basis for his conclusion that the age of the applicant's father reduces security 
concerns under Guideline B; also noting that foreign government could bring pressure to bear on the applicant's father through threats concerning father's 
pension).  Finally, nothing in Guideline B indicates or suggests that it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 (September 22, 2005) at p. 6.  The Board has warned "against reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between 'friendly' nations and 'hostile' nations 
when adjudicating cases under Guideline B."  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (March 29, 2002) at p. 6.  In his decision, the Judge articulated a rational basis for 
his conclusion that Applicant's circumstances increased Applicant's vulnerability to foreign influence.  Considering the record as a whole, it was not arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law for the Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his burden of producing sufficient evidence to warrant the application of 
itigating Conditions 1 or to conclude that Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline B.</P>
