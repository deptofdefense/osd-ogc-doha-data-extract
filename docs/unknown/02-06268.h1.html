<P>Applicant has a lengthy history of alcohol abuse and related criminal conduct, including a driving while intoxicated (DWI) conviction, a driving under the 
influence (DUI) conviction, and several public intoxication convictions.  He voluntarily sought and received inpatient and outpatient alcohol abuse treatment in 
June 2001, has regularly attended alcoholics anonymous since his completion of that treatment, and has not had an alcoholic beverage in more than two years.  
He has successfully mitigated the security concerns that arose from his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct.  Applicant also has a lengthy history of 
financial delinquencies that he had failed to remedy by the time of the hearing.  Having failed to introduce satisfactory evidence to demonstrate that he is on the 
path to becoming a financially responsible individual, Applicant is unable to mitigate the financial issues that have been raised.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations.  
Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR on April 14, 2003, requested a hearing, and admitted every allegation in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 29, 2003 and reassigned to me on May 30, 2003 because of caseload concerns.  A notice of 
hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for June 24, 2003.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted twenty-five documentary 
exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-25 and admitted into the record without an objection.<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Applicant testified at the 
hearing and submitted six exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-6, and admitted into the record without an objection.  The transcript was 
received on July 2, 2003.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 32-year-old single man who was hired by a defense contractor into an apprentice training program on March 22, 1999.  He submitted five letters 
from instructors and other persons who he has worked with or for at his place of employment that attest to the outstanding academic record he established and 
his reputation for being dependable and having an outstanding work record.  At least two of the individuals who submitted a character reference letter on 
Applicant's behalf were aware he had some personal issues and had sought assistance from the employee assistance program.  Applicant also attended junior 
college from August 2001 to June 9, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested and convicted on two occasions in 1991, and on two additional occasions in 1997, for offenses involving either public intoxication or 
unlawful possession of alcohol.  He was arrested on March 2, 1989 and charged with DWI.  His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of that arrest 
was .14.  He was convicted of this offense, ordered to pay a fine and had his driver's license suspended for six months.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He was arrested on November 12, 1994 and charged with DUI.  His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) at the time of that arrest was .19.  He was convicted of 
that offense on April 19, 1995, fined $200.00, and had his driver's license suspended for 12 months.  While this DUI was pending, Applicant was arrested for 
the offense of driving under suspension (DUS).  While he admits driving a vehicle at the time, he denies that he knew his driving privileges had been 
suspended.  Applicant was convicted of this offense and ordered to pay a fine.                       </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was found by a court to be a habitual offender on August 8, 1995 based upon his DWI, DUI, and DUS convictions.  While the SOR alleges, and 
Applicant admits this resulted in his driving privileges being revoked for a period of ten years, the court order that was entered states that Applicant ". . . is 
hereby prohibited </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>until further order of this Court</EM>, or other appropriate Court, from operating a motor vehicle on the highways. . . ."  His driving privileges 
were reinstated on December 5, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on July 10, 1989 and charged with assaulting his mother.  That charge was dismissed at the mother's request.  He was convicted of 
uttering a bad check in 1991 and ordered to pay a fine and make restitution.  On August 19, 1993, a charge of trespass that had been filed against Applicant for 
an incident that occurred on July 31, 1993 was nolle prossed.  Applicant was again arrested and charged with trespass on June 2, 1996.  This offense occurred 
after Applicant observed his girlfriend's automobile in the driveway of another man's house and attempted to gain entry in an apparent attempt to confront 
them.  He was convicted of this offense on June 20, 1996, sentenced to 30 days in jail, 27 days of the sentence being suspended, and fined $100.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant started drinking alcohol when he was approximately 14-years-old, which would have been about 1985.  His consumption of alcohol increased from 
about six beers per week at that time, to the point where he was consuming approximately 24 beers per week from the ages of 21 to 26.  At least partially 
realizing the problems alcohol was causing in his life, Applicant reduced his consumption to about twelve beers per month.  In June 2001, Applicant initiated a 
request for help with his alcohol problem through his employer's assistance program.  He entered a 3-day detoxification program on June 21, 2001, and was 
thereafter referred to an intensive outpatient program that he attended for three hours an evening, two evenings a week, for fourteen weeks.  Following his 
successful completion of these programs, he began attending AA meetings.  He continues to attend from three to six AA meetings a week.  He now has a 
sponsor in the AA program, and has not consumed any alcohol since entering the detoxification program in June 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has a long history of financial irresponsibility.  There are accounts listed in the SOR, totaling $2,128.00,<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> that, although not alleged as such in the 
SOR, have been placed for collection.  There are three additional accounts listed in the SOR, totaling $2,234.00, on which judgments have been entered against 
Applicant that have not been satisfied.  Finally, there are two accounts listed in the SOR, totaling $2,493.64, on which judgments were entered against 
Applicant and only satisfied by means of wage garnishments.  Applicant has had disposal income he could have applied toward settling these accounts since at 
least May 11, 2001 when he submitted a personal financial statement disclosing net monthly remaining income, after payment of all living expenses, of 
$773.00.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chiefs among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a

than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-06268.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior.  Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant began abusing alcohol when he was 14-years-old and started drinking a six-pack of beer on a weekly basis.  As he got older, his drinking problem 
increased to the point where he was consuming a case of beer a week and was arrested on six occasions for alcohol related offenses, including a DUI and a 
DWI.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, 
or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>; and DC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment </EM>apply in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant began to realize he had a drinking problem following his last alcohol related arrest in 1997, and significantly reduced the amount of alcohol he was 
consuming.  In June 2001, he accepted the fact that reduced consumption was an insufficient remedy because the use of alcohol was still causing him problems 
in his personal life.  He sought assistance from his employer's assistance program and successfully completed a detoxification program and an intensive 
outpatient program.  Following completion of those programs, Applicant began attending AA meetings on a frequent and regular basis, and has acquired an AA 
sponsor.  He has not had a drink of alcohol since commencing the treatment programs, and, as evidenced by the character reference letters he submitted, there is 
every reason to believe he will remain abstinent in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigating Conditions (MC) 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Positive changes in 
behavior supportive of sobriety  </EM>applies.  Considering all the evidenced presented on this security concern, I find that the Mitigating Conditions substantially 
outweigh the Disqualifying Conditions and that Applicant is able to mitigate this security concern.  Guideline G is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets.  A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case against Applicant under Guideline J.  The evidence establishes that Applicant was arrested on numerous occasions 
between his first arrest on July 10, 1989 and his last arrest on October 17, 1997.  Included in those arrests are a DUI, a DWI, three public intoxications and two 
trespass offenses.  DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It has been nearly six years since Applicant was  last arrested.  Since that time he has completed the alcohol programs noted above and has maintained sobriety 
for more than two years.  He has worked for the same employer for more than 4 years, and has earned a reputation of being a good and trusted employee.  MC 
1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>apply in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After considering the evidence of record in this case, and weighing the disqualifying conditions against the mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns caused by his criminal conduct.  He has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion.  
Guideline J is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has significant unpaid debts that have either been referred for collection or resulted in the entry of judgments against him.  He acknowledges that the 
cause of his adverse financial position is his irresponsibility and unwillingness to accept responsibility for his actions.  He was put on notice that his debt 
situation was a security concern in December 2002 when he received interrogatories asking for information concerning those debts in the course of his security 
application investigation.  If, for some reason, he did not grasp the significance of his debt situation at that time, it could not have been more clearly brought 
home to him than it was by issuance of the SOR on April 3, 2003.  Despite receiving these warnings, and with the financial ability to make at least some 
payment toward satisfying the delinquent accounts, he has made no effort to do so.  The only evidence introduced showing any payment on the accounts is 
contained in AE 6, which consists of receipts, the last in time being dated November 8, 2002, well prior to the warnings noted above.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on all the evidence presented in this case, I find that DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>: and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts </EM>apply in this case.  I cannot  find that any Mitigating Condition</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> applies in this case.  Accordingly, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern 
caused by his financial considerations and Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfy his ultimate 
burden of persuasion.  It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
