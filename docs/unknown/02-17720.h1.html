<P>Applicant has 19 delinquent debts alleged in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  He mitigated </P> 
<P>a number of them, and has made attempts to pay the others.  Several debts alleged are actually the same debt listed by different collectors on the credit report.  
Applicant's presentation at the hearing and his documentary evidence show clearly that he is confused about the extent of his debts and whether they are past 
due more than 180 days.  Applicant did not mitigate all of the financial considerations security concern, and also did not mitigate the personal conduct security 
concern.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On August 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons under 
Guideline F(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>On September 9, 2003, Applicant submitted an extensive statement on the allegations, which was found to be non-responsive as required by the Directive.  
Applicant then submitted a signed and sworn Answer dated November 5, 2003.  He requested a hearing.  This case was assigned to me on January 12, 2004.  A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on January 20, 2004, setting the hearing for February 5, 2004.  I convened the hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The Government presented four exhibits which were admitted into evidence. Applicant 
submitted 14 exhibits at the hearing, and 10 additional exhibits subsequent to the hearing, to which the Government had no objection<A HREF="02-17720.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>.  I received the transcript 
of the hearing on February 24, 2004.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government moved to amend subparagraph 1.b. to delete the initial language, and substitute new wording specifying one creditor as being owed $592.00.  
Applicant did not object, and the motion was granted.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 1.c., 1.g., 1.h., and 1.l. through 1.s.  Applicant denied subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. through 1.f., 1.i. 
through 1.k.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 49-year-old machine tool worker at a defense contractor's plant.  He is married, with one son from his first marriage and has adopted his present 
wife's children.  He works at the same plant as he has for 25 years.  His annual income is about $39,000. (Tr. 15, 102, 104 to 106; Exhibit 1).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant neglected the payment of 19 debts, with the earliest being incurred in 1996 .  Applicant's financial problems were caused by his inability to manage 
his money properly, medical costs for various treatments for himself and family members, and his 1989 divorce.  The SOR allegations and the evidence 
introduced at the hearing are summarized in the following table: (Tr. 112 to 122</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's debts total about $40,000 as alleged in the SOR.  While these debts were delinquent, Applicant purchased a 2002 sports utility vehicle for $30,000, 
on which he is paying $775 monthly and regularly.  Upon completion of the installment payment contract in three years, Applicant will have paid nearly 
$46,000 for this vehicle.  This vehicle is the only auto Applicant owns, and he does most of the driving for his family. (Tr. 108, 109, 139, 147)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant talked to two attorneys in the past three years on how to resolve and pay his debts, including discussing bankruptcy, but no action was taken at that 
time.  Applicant consulted also with a debt payment service, and has an intention of hiring that firm to get his debts paid.  He saw their advertisement on 
television and contacted them about helping him.  He is negotiating with them about helping him resolve his debts.  Applicant thinks his delinquent debt 
situation is good because he only has six debts remaining to be paid by his calculations. (Tr. 41, 126, 133 to 136, 141)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Throughout the hearing Applicant displayed a lack of knowledge about to what creditor he owed what sum of money.  He seemed uncertain and confused about 
his debt history, what debts had been paid, and in what amount.  Applicant does not have a firm grasp of his financial situation and does not manage his money 
well.  Applicant thought garnishment meant the bills were being paid. (Tr. 8, 9, 59, 61, 69 to 71, 101, 146)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not disclose the existence of these debts on his security clearance application (SCA).  He answered "No" to question 38 regarding delinquent 
debts over 180 days past due, when the debts listed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR are all over 180 days delinquent.  Applicant also answered Question 39 regarding 
delinquent debts over 90 days past due as "No", again failing to disclose the delinquent debts set forth in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  Applicant's evident lack of 
factual knowledge about the extent and current status of his debts at the hearing made it impossible for him to fully answer these two questions on the SCA. 
(Answer; Exhibits 1 and V)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After the conclusion of the hearing, and during the period granted Applicant to compile his disconnected pile of papers into a coherent response to the SOR 
allegations, coordinating them with the specific allegations of Paragraph 1, Applicant failed to return eight of the 12 exhibits, and submitted other documents, 
which were marked as exhibits O through V.  The Government had no objection to the marking and admission of the additional post-hearing exhibits. (Tr. 49)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id</EM>. At 527.The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>&sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility 
for a security clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F: Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) A history of not meeting financial obligations. E2.A6.1.2.1</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> E2.A6.1.2.3</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) The individual is making a good faith effort to pay his debts. E2.A6.1.3.6</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(A) The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(B) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; E2.A5.1.2.2 </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(C) Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative 
finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, I draw those 
inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering Guideline F (Financial Considerations), I find Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 and 3 apply.  Applicant does not have the income to pay all these 
debts at one time or in a short period of time, or over a period of time.  His income is about $39,000 annually.  With debts exceeding $40,000, plus the normal 
living expenses of daily life, Applicant could not repay those debts in less than at least five years.  He aggravated his financial ability to repay these delinquent 
debts by purchasing a $30,000 automobile, and paying a high interest rate because of his bad credit rating that made his monthly payments $775.  While 
Applicant has made numerous attempts to repay his debts, and has repaid several of them, there are delinquent debts remaining unpaid, and they are listed in 
subparagraphs 1.a., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1.m., and 1.o. of the SOR.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find no Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply to this case.  The only MC which might have applied was MC 6, but that MC requires a "good-faith" effort to repay 
debts or resolve them.  The DOHA Appeals Board, in various decisions, has opined that "the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing that a person acts in a 
way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation" (ISCR Case No. 02-07138 (December 9, 2003), citing ISCR Case No. 
99-9020 (June 4, 2001).  Applicant has made a some effort at various times to repay his delinquent debts, but it is not and was not a systematic approach which 
would qualify for the application of MC 6.  He managed to repay six debts (subparagraphs 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.l.  Other, larger delinquent debts 
remain unpaid for many years.  His explanations of his debts at the hearing was confusing as to what amount is owed to which creditor, and what the current 
status of the debt was.  While he owes many debts, he takes it upon himself to pay debts incurred by family members, for example, his adopted son who has not 
contributed any money to repay the phone bill in subparagraph 1.o.  Some of the debts arose from his divorce situation in 1989, but those were mitigated.  
Applicant considered garnishment of his pay a repayment of debt method, but it is not a voluntary method.  He also believes he has paid $12,000 on a debt of 
about $3,000 through that garnishment.  In efforts to rid himself of this debt burden, Applicant talked to two attorneys seeking legal advice on reducing and 
paying his debts, and considered bankruptcy.  He also is talking to a debt resolution company about helping him alleviate this debt problem.  He never made a 
decision to avail himself of any of the available advice and legal methods to pay his debts in a structured and timely fashion.  Applicant has only exerted 
periodically haphazard attempts to resolve his delinquent debt problem, and needs to apply more effort.  The crowning touch to Applicant's efforts to repay his 
delinquent debts was his purchase of a $30,000 automobile on which he pays $775 monthly due to his bad credit rating.  He could have done nicely with a good 
quality used car, or a cheaper new car.  That $775 monthly would have paid a lot of debts rapidly.  He can make those payments regularly, but he cannot pay his 
other debts on time.  After looking at all the evidence, and considering Applicant's confusing and confused presentation at the hearing, the lengthy duration of 
the debts and the amounts outstanding, and Applicant's failure to return eight exhibits as ordered, I conclude that Applicant has not made good-faith efforts to 
repay his debts.  Applicant has not met his burden of proof.  Therefore, I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, I conclude the Government proved its case.  The totality of Applicant's delinquent debt situation is not disclosed in the SCA in 
Question 38 (debts over 180 days delinquent in the past seven years) and Question 39 (debts over 90 days delinquent).  Applicant disclosed two large debts, 
which were later included in the SOR, being subparagraph 1.c. and its allied subparagraphs, and subparagraph 1.r.  Applicant also disclosed the garnishments in 
1999.  Applicant completed the SCA in 2001, and seven years previous would be 1994.  During that time period Applicant was making payments periodically 
on some of his debts.  Yet there were many others which were unpaid for more than 180 days, and the Government clearly proved the long list of those debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As regards mitigating conditions, Applicant disclosed the two judgments against him, and he made further disclosures in response to Question 43 about his 
debts.  From Applicant's presentation at the hearing, it is clearly evident to me that he did not know at the hearing what debts were delinquent for what length 
of time, but he did know he had debts.  He also knew many were delinquent longer than 180 days.  He failed to disclose any of those debts, or answer Questions 
38 and 39 with a "yes" and provide the information subsequently.  He could be specific about his judgments, and if he could remember them, he could 
remember other debts.  I do not apply any MC to this case under this guideline.  Consequently, I find Against Applicant on Guideline E.</SPAN></P>
