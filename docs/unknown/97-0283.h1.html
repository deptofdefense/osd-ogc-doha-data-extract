<P>		On April 15, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant
to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January
2, 1992, amended by Change 3, February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine
whether clearance should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer
to the SOR May 14, 1997.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on July 7, 1997. A notice of hearing was issued
on July 8, 1997, and the case was heard on August 7, 1997. The Government submitted documentary
evidence. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript was received on August 18, 1997. </P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Following Findings of Fact are based on the documentation and testimony. The SOR
alleges drug involvement (Criterion H). Applicant admitted all the allegations of the SOR but noted
he last purchased marijuana in 1991 and not August 1996 as alleged in the SOR.</P>

<P>	Applicant is 34 years old and employed as a vice president and technology officer for a
defense contractor. He seeks a secret level clearance.</P>

<P>	Applicant used marijuana from 1976 to at least October 1996.<A HREF="97-0283.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Applicant's stated intention
not to use marijuana in the future is undermined by his ambiguous testimony in explaining question
24a of the security form. (GE #1) His heaviest use of the drug was from 1977 to 1981, but his use
dropped from 1986 to 1991 while he was in college. After his baby was born in 1991 he reduced his
marijuana use. He purchased the drug from 1977 to at least October  1996.<A HREF="97-0283.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Applicant used cocaine
about 10 times between 1980 and 1981. He purchased and used LSD around twenty times between
1980 and 1981. Applicant used hashish between 10 and 15 times between 1977 and the early 1980s.
He used opium about five times between 1977 and the early 1980s. Finally, he used Quaaludes,
Valium, and amphetamines between 1980 and 1986. </P>

<P>	Applicant maintains he is an honest person. He also believes he is trustworthy because he is
routinely supplied confidential information about employees of various corporations.  </P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance
on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of fact,
must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to evaluation
of the facts in this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Involvement (Criterion H)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>1. any drug use;</P>

<P>	2. illegal drug possession,...purchase....</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive)
include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the
time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and, (8) the
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant
may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative Judge can
only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence
of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative
or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under drug involvement (Criterion 
H) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. While a
rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability
to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to the sufficiency of proof of a rational
connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely
to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P><U>	</U>The Government has established a case of drug involvement under Criterion H. While 
Applicant's use of use of cocaine, opium, Quaaludes, Valium, amphetamines, his purchase and use
of LSD and hashish, stopped approximately 11 years ago without subsequent evidence to infer or
suggest recurrence, Applicant's continuing marijuana involvement after 1986, raises residual doubts
about whether there will be a recurrence of drug use in the future. Applicant has used marijuana from
1976 to October 1996 at different frequencies. Although Applicant strenuously claims he quit
marijuana drug use in August 1996, his language in response to GE #1 provides a more reasonable
inference that he was using marijuana after August 1996 to at least until October 22, 1996, when he
filled out GE #1.</P>

<P>	Applicant's confusing testimony regarding the words he inserted in response to the drug use
question on the security form (GE #1), casts a cloud over Applicant's credibility. Applicant's
credibility is weakened even more by his 'no' answer to question 24c of the form asking whether he
had ever purchased drugs. In addition, Applicant has offered no independent evidence in support of
his claim he stopped using marijuana in August 1996.</P>

<P>	The record reflects Applicant's drug use was recent because it occurred as recently as a year
ago in October 1996. Although Applicant describes his use as isolated or infrequent as far back as
1991, his suspect credibility raises a strong suggestion he used the drug more between 1991 and
1996 than he is willing to admit.</P>

<P>	Although Applicant has stated in GE #2, his Answer and at the hearing his intention not to
use marijuana in the future, his stated intention cannot receive blind acceptance but must be weighed
against several facts in the record. First, the words in Applicant's response to question 24a of the
security form (GE #1) clearly provides a logical and reasonable conclusion that Applicant had been
using marijuana at least until October 1996 when he submitted the form. Second, Applicant's
testimony in response to question 24a is ambiguous and has no probative value in understanding why
Applicant chose present-tense language in his response to question 24a, if he had actually stopped
using marijuana two months before he filled out the security form.</P>

<P>	Second, even though Applicant's incorrect response to question 24c (drug purchase question) 
is not alleged in the SOR, telling the Government he never purchased drugs when he actually did,
undermines Applicant's credibility even further.</P>

<P>	Considering Applicant's marijuana involvement from 1976 to October 1996, his suspect
credibility, and the absence of independent evidence to corroborate his honesty, his trustworthiness,
and his intentions to forego drug use in the future, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden
of persuasion under Criterion H.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Having weighed the specific policy factors under Criterion H with the general policy factors
under the whole person concept, Formal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the
Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1 (drug involvement-Criterion H):     AGAINST THE APPLICANT.</P>

<P>	     a. Against the Applicant (to October 1996).</P>

<P>	     b. Against the Applicant (to October 1996).</P>

<P>	     c. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>	     d. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>	     e. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>	     f. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>	     g. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>	     h. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>	     i. For the Applicant.</P>

<P>	     k. For the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>DECISION</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</U></STRONG>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER>Administrative Judge</P>


<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> In response to question 24a, the drug activity question on the security form (GE #1), Applicant indicated
he used marijuana from October 1989 to the present, and that his use was often early but now only once or twice a
year. Also, he testified he was in a hurry and misunderstood question 24a.  Applicant's explanations for why he
chose the word 'present' are not credible (TR. 22-23), especially when considered with the word 'now' he chose to
describe the number of times he was using the drug. Applicant's overall credibility is undermined even more by his
'no' answer to question 24c (the drug purchase question). See, GE #1. Even though his failure to disclose his
periodic drug purchases was not alleged in the SOR and are not considered on the merits of this case, the
concealment raises some doubt about Applicant's  overall credibility.
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> While Applicant maintains his last use was in 1991 (Answer), his confusing testimony relating to his
response to question 24a, and his incorrect response to question 24c of the security form, persuades me to find he
purchased marijuana until August 1996.
