<P>Applicant's past drug use over a thirty year period raises security concerns. Applicant is disqualified from having a security clearance under a provision of the 
Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, 10 U.S.C. Section 986 ("The Smith Amendment") as statutory provision (2) applies 
to anyone who "is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802)."  
Applicant's recent use of marijuana and cocaine falls within this statutory prohibition as he knowingly and willfully continued this drug use against the 
government's security policies.  While he has a good employment record, such excellence on the job does not erase the security significance of his 
acknowledged drug use after applying for a security clearance.  Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 22, 2002.  (Item 1)  The SOR detailed 
reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-02413.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over drug use (Guideline H). Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer 
notarized on November 20, 2002, where he admitted all of the allegations except for 1.d. and 1.p. and requested a hearing. (Item 2)  The case was assigned to 
Department Counsel who attested it was ready to proceed; and the case was assigned to me.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed 
to; and a Notice of Hearing was issued which set the matter for January 28, 2003, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  On January 10, 2003, 
Applicant requested his case be decided on a written record as he wanted to "recall" his request to have a hearing.  (Item 4)</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel to prepare for a decision on the administrative record.  On February 7, 2003, she prepared the File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) for the Applicant's review and advised Applicant that he had 30 days to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was 
submitted to an administrative judge and that he had the right to be represented by counsel.  Included in the items provided to Applicant was a copy of the 
DOHA Operating Instruction No. 64 for Processing Procedures for Cases Subject to 10 U.S.C. 986.  (Item 9)</P> 
 
<P>A Personnel Security Specialist (PSS) sent the FORM to Applicant on February 18, 2003, and again notified the Applicant that he had 30 days from receipt of 
the letter to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge. Applicant  received the FORM and submitted a 
response (Exhibit A) which DOHA received on April 2, 2003.  On April 11, 2003, Department Counsel indicated she did not object to Applicant's submission.  
On April 14, 2003, the case was assigned to me.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>A provision of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, 10 U.S.C. Section 986 ("The Smith Amendment"),  mandates 
restrictions on the granting or renewal of security clearances.  This statutory limitation was implemented within the Department of Defense by a June 7, 2001, 
emorandum, and within DOHA by Operating Instruction (OI) 64, issued on July 10, 2001.  (Item 9)  Statutory provision (2) applies to anyone who "is an 
unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802)."  This case falls within 
this statutory provision. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 50 years old, has worked for Defense Contractor #1 in State #1 since July 1998.   (Item5; Exhibit A)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was married in 1980.  (Item 5; Exhibit A)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In completing a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in October 1999, Applicant only admitted marijuana use three to six times per year from July 1992 to 
ay 1990.  (Item 6)  When interviewed by the Defense Security Service (DSS) in October 2000, Applicant admitted much more extensive drug use (Item 7):</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI><STRONG>Marijuana</STRONG>: Applicant began using in September 1972 while in college; his use increased from 1973 to 1977.  He would purchase marijuana paying $15 for 
once ounce every four to six weeks and would occasionally resell small amounts to friends.  He once purchased a one-fourth pound baggie of marijuana for 
$40.  From 1977 to 2000 Applicant used marijuana three to six times yearly.  He was detained by Canadian custom officials in summer 1979 for possession 
of drug paraphernalia.  He never sought counseling for his use of marijuana.  At the time of his DSS interview in October 2000 Applicant stated that he 
intended "to use marijuana on a recreational basis in the future."  (Item 7)  In fact, he used marijuana again in July 2002.  (Item 8)  In his April 2003 response 
Applicant stated that he does not intend to use drugs in the future.  (Exhibit A)  He submitted to a five panel drug screen in March 2003; no drug use was 
detected.  (Exhibit A)  However, given his past conduct and contrary statement to DSS in 200, I can give this April 2003 statement and the one-time negative 
drug test limited weight.  Further, this new statement of a decision not to use drugs in the future was not subject to cross examination by the Government as 
on January 10, 2003, Applicant requested his case be decided on a written record as he decided to "recall" his request to have a hearing.  (Item 4)</LI> 
 
1990-1991.  He purchased cocaine in the 1970's on two occasions and paid $100 per gram and purchased again in the 1990-91 period.  He would snort 
cocaine up his nostrils.  He would become jittery and grind his teeth while under the effects of cocaine.  In September/October 1999 Applicant used cocaine 
at the home of friends.  He did so after he completed his SF 86 in summer 1999. (Item 7)  Applicant does not intend to use cocaine again.  (Item 7) Given his 
past conduct I can give his April 2003 statement and the one-time negative drug test limited weight as his new statement of a decision not to use drugs in the 
future was not subject to cross examination by the Government as on January 10, 2003, Applicant requested his case be decided on a written record as he 
decided to "recall" his request to have a hearing.  (Item 4)</LI> 
 
not intend to use LSD in the future.  (Item 7)</LI> 
 
to use speed in the future.  (Item 7)</LI> 
 
 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Job Performance</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has received favorable performance reviews from 1993-2002  (Exhibit A, Attachments 3-10)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>References</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a favorable reference letter from his manager who has known him for almost thirteen years.  This manager has "great respect and trust" in 
Applicant who is a valuable asset to the contractor.  The manger is "confident in his abilities to perform his job in the future." (Exhibit A, Attachment 1)</P> 
 
<P>A former supervisor who has known Applicant since the late 1980's also provided a favorable letter concerning his ability, stability, character and honest.  
Applicant worked for this individual from 1990 to 1995 when the office was consolidated.  He entrusted Applicant with "the most sensitive of internal 
processes and he always remained a steadfast and trustworthy associate.  (Exhibit A, Attachment 2)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[First]  Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[Second] Inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Any drug abuse (see above definition); </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government established security concerns over Applicant's intermittent marijuana use  that spanned the 30-year period 1972 to 2002, his intermittent 
cocaine use that spanned the period  from 1973 to 1999, and his experimental use of LSD in 1974, as well as his experimental use of speed and Quaaludes in 
the 1970's.  He also purchased marijuana in the 1970's and cocaine in the 1990's.  He was detained by Canadian custom officials in summer 1979 for possession 
of drug paraphernalia.  In fact, he continued to use both marijuana (in October 2000 and in July 2002) and cocaine (October 1999) even after he had applied for 
a security clearance in September 1999.  At the time of his DSS interview in October 2000 he stated that he intended "to use marijuana on a recreational basis 
in the future."   Thus, his conduct falls within disqualifying conditions 1 and 2, detailed above.</P> 
 
<P>Further, Applicant is disqualified from having a security clearance under a provision of the Smith Amendment.  This statutory provision (2) applies to anyone 
who "is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802)."  Applicant's 
recent use of marijuana and cocaine falls within this statutory prohibition.  </P> 
 
<P>To his credit, Applicant has a successful work record and favorable references which indicate partial rehabilitation. Applicant in April 2003 stated he has no 
longer any intent to use drugs in the future and provided a March 2003 negative drug screen.  However, given his thirty-year history of intermittent use of 
marijuana and cocaine, this very  recent statement of commitment to avoid drugs in the future is not sufficiently persuasive to mitigate fully  his past drug use 
over a thirty year period given his earlier statement to DSS in October 2000 that he planed to continue recreational use of marijuana.  However, his 
experimental use of LSD, speed and Qualuudes which was limited to the 1970's is mitigated under Mitigation Condition (MC) 1, as that drug involvement was 
not recent.   Further by not using again for almost thirty years, this drug use falls within MC 3.  Also, his use and purchase of marijuana and cocaine in the 
1970's as well as his detention in 1979 by Canadian custom officials for possession of drug paraphernalia is mitigated under MC 1.  Thus, he has mitigated his  
past drug use in part.  On the other hand, for Applicant to continue to use drugs after he completed his SF 86 and knew, or should have known, such drug use 
was against  the government's policies raises sizeable questions about his judgment overall.  With respect to those drugs he fails to meet the test of MC<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 3, a 
demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future as his recent decision to stop using drugs is too recent to be given the test of his commitment over time 
given his long history.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b.,1.c., 1.e., 1.h., 
1.i., 1.j., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., but against Applicant on subparagraphs 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., 1.k., 1.l., 1.p. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 1. </P>
