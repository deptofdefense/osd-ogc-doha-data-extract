<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June 15, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On February 
17, 2006, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Erin C. Hogan denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed 
pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  Instead, Applicant states that he now appreciates the seriousness 
of his situation and requests that the case be remanded so he can retain a lawyer and have a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>A review of the record indicates Applicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the Directive.  Although <EM>pro se</EM> 
applicants cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR 
Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial 
of their rights.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2003).</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  
Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error.  Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is 
AFFIRMED.</P>
