<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 24, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 20, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on March 11, 2002, 
and a Notice of Hearing was issued on March 21, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on April 24, 2002, at which the Government presented seven documentary exhibits, and called one witness.  Testimony was taken from the 
Applicant, who also submitted four hearing exhibits and three post-hearing exhibits.  Applicant's Exhibit E consists of the Applicant's work-related 
performance reviews; Applicant's Exhibit F is a letter of recommendation from his Unit Security Officer; and Applicant's Exhibit G is the Amended Schedules 
to the Applicant's bankruptcy case.  The transcript was received on May 3, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 41, single and has a high school diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Supply Technician Lead, and he seeks to obtain a DoD 
security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and 
the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>.  It is alleged in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to obtain funds.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits that he is indebted to the creditors set forth in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i. of the SOR.  The debts all became delinquent during the 
time period from 1995 through 1997.  The Applicant states that most of the debts were incurred during a period when he was attempting to establish a business 
in 1994 and 1995.  Specifically, subparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.g. concern credit cards that the Applicant used to try to keep his business going. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stopped paying on this indebtedness in 1996 because he simply did not have the funds.  From 1995 through 1999 the Applicant went through 
several periods of unemployment and underemployment.  In addition, he testified that he spoke with an attorney who recommended against bankruptcy at that 
point in time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1999, the Applicant was interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS).  He made a sworn statement in which he indicated that he 
would resolve his indebtedness as soon as possible.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  Due to family problems the Applicant was not able to take care of these debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act on March 29, 2002.  (Applicant's Exhibit B.)  He filed his amended schedule of creditors 
on May 1, 2002.  (Applicant's Exhibit G.)  The Applicant's debts had not been discharged in bankruptcy before the record closed on May 3, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to Applicant's Exhibit G, the Applicant owes the following amounts to the creditors named in the SOR.  The total amount is $25,589.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. $62.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. $2,841.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. $10,000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d. $9,521.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. $521.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. $743.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. $1,625.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.h. $126.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.i. $150.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's financial situation was fairly secure before he decided to start his business in 1994.  (Applicant's Exhibit A.)  His current financial situation is 
tight, but the Applicant submits that he is able to maintain his current payments.  He does not have any current credit cards and pays cash for almost everything.  
Given five years, the Applicant could have paid off these overdue debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His work evaluations show that the Applicant is a valued employee who works hard and is respected on the job.  (Applicant's Exhibit E.)  His Unit Security 
Officer wrote a letter of recommendation which states, "His [the Applicant's] behavior has, at all times, consistently exhibited high moral and ethical 
standards."  (Applicant's Exhibit F.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F (Financial considerations)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may have excessive indebtedness that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has been approximately $25,000 in debt for several years.  He has known since 1999 of the Government's concerns about this situation.  Only 
after the Notice of Hearing was issued to the Applicant did he file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  His debts had not been discharged as of the date the record closed.  
His arguments about why he has not been able to resolve these problems have been noted, but they do not rise to the level of mitigating the security concerns of 
his long-standing indebtedness.  Paragraph 1 and its subparagraphs are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The Applicant is not currently eligible for a security clearance.  However, if his debts are  successfully discharged in bankruptcy, and he continues to make 
timely payments on his current debts, he may be eligible for a security clearance in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons. </SPAN></P>
