  Discharge of debts in bankruptcy does not immunize Applicant's history of financial problems from review for its security significance.  Applicant's history of financial problems, which resulted in two bankruptcies, provides rational  basis for Administrative Judge's concerns about Applicant's security suitability.  Adverse decision affirmed.    </P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Jerome H. Silber issued a decision, dated July 31, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On February 26, 1998, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. 
The SOR was based on Criterion F (Financial Considerations).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">A hearing was held on June 17, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision.  The Judge found
Applicant had $86,400 in debts discharged in bankruptcy on March 13, 1991, and Applicant had debts in excess of
$107,000 discharged in bankruptcy on May 15, 1998.  The Judge considered Applicant's history of financial difficulties
and concluded Applicant's history of financial irresponsibility had negative security implications that were not overcome
by the favorable evidence presented by Applicant.  The Judge concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse decision.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's factual findings about his history of financial difficulties.  Rather,
Applicant contends that the Judge should not have made an adverse security clearance decision because his debts were
discharged in bankruptcy and were thus "satisfied" and should no longer be considered against him.  Applicant also
contends he is not financially overextended and that he presented evidence that mitigated any security concerns raised by
his financial history.  The Board construes Applicant's arguments as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to
classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 508, 511 n.6 (1980); <EM>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union,
Local 473 v. McElroy</EM>, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), <EM>aff'd</EM>, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  Furthermore, the federal
government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to properly safeguard classified information
before it can deny or revoke that person's access to classified information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C.
Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Under Criterion F, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into
question when that applicant has a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring financial difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR
Case No. 96-0544 (May 12, 1997) at pp. 5-6 (discussing security implications of financial problems).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">In this case, the Administrative Judge made findings about Applicant's history of financial problems.  Those findings,
which are supported by the record evidence and were not challenged on appeal, provide a rational basis for the Judge's
concerns about Applicant's suitability for access to classified information.  Furthermore, the record evidence provided the
Judge with a rational basis for his doubts about Applicant's ability to avoid financial problems in the future.  Moreover,
the Judge acted reasonably when he concluded the discharge of Applicant's debts in bankruptcy did not eliminate the
security concerns raised by Applicant's history of financial difficulties.  Although a discharge of debts in bankruptcy may
provide an applicant with a fresh start financially, it does not immunize the applicant's history of financial problems from
scrutiny for its security significance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 4.  Accordingly, it was
entirely proper for the Judge to consider Applicant's overall financial history and evaluate its security significance despite
the fact that Applicant's debts were discharged in bankruptcy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Finally, the favorable evidence presented by Applicant did not preclude the Administrative Judge from making an adverse
decision.  Although Applicant may not be financially overextended in the immediate aftermath of his second bankruptcy,
the Judge must consider the record evidence as a whole (Directive, Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable
evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0783 (August 7, 1998) at p. 5. 
Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes the favorable evidence presented by Applicant did not require the
Judge, as a matter of law, to make a favorable security clearance decision.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the
Administrative Judge's July 31, 1998 decision.</FONT></P>
