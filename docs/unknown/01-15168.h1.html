<P>Applicant incurred several debts when his wife ran up credit card expenses while he was deployed at sea with the U.S. Navy.  His subsequent separation and 
divorce, and the initial support payments of $28,000 a year, put Applicant further in debt.  He has paid off most of the delinquent debts, had his support 
obligations reduced to $14,000 a year, and made good-faith efforts to resolve the others.  Applicant sufficiently mitigated the financial considerations security 
concerns.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 16 May 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="01-15168.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="01-15168.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 12 June 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was originally assigned to another administrative judge, but was transferred to me on 12 November 2003.  On 9 
December 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 30 December  2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant served in the US. Navy as a fire control technician.  Tr. 29.  He entered the service in May 1990.  He married in July 1992 and had three children with 
his wife.  Ex. 1 at 5.  Applicant's wife, using a power of attorney Applicant gave her so she could manage the family finances while he was deployed on 
extended sea duty, ran up tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt.  Tr. 10.  On 30 October 1998, Applicant signed a separation agreement obligating him 
to pay $28,000 a year in child and spousal support.  Tr. 10-11.  Applicant separated from the Navy in January 1999.  Ex. 1 at 5.  Applicant is now divorced.  
Applicant is no longer responsible for spousal support, only child support, thus reducing his payments to $14,000 a year.</P>

<P>The debt in &para; 1.f. resulted from his failure to turn in the electronic box for his cable television when he moved.  He is looking for the box.  If he doesn't find it, 
he will pay the debt.  Tr. 25.  The debt alleged in &para; 1.d. was actually some $22,000 and consisted of a combination of delinquent child and spousal support.  
Applicant's father paid the debt as a gift to his son.  Applicant does not owe any money as a result of the foreclosure on his home.  Tr. 24.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent financial accounts (&para; 1.a.-1.c., 1.f.-1.i.); delinquent child support obligations (&para; 1.d.); and a foreclosure 
action (&para; 1.e.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.l.l.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established through substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations contained in the SOR.  The facts establish that 
Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and was unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  
However, the conditions that resulted in this behavior were largely beyond Applicant's control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3)-his wife ran up considerable credit card debt 
while he was deployed at sea and his separation agreement required him to pay such a substantial portion of his income that he was unable to address some of 
his wife's debts.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant has not quite finished paying off all of his delinquent debts, he is well on the road to resolving his financial problems.  There is little likelihood 
of a recurrence of these problems and no potential Applicant would be exploited for the few remaining debts.  Applicant is an honorable man who recognizes 
the need to pay off his debts.  Although he considered filing for bankruptcy, he decided to weather the storm and pay these debts off.  Applicant fully 
understands that failure to keep his financial affairs in order could lead to the revocation of a security clearance.  Under all the circumstances of this case, 
Applicant has sufficiently mitigated the financial considerations and does not represent a security risk.  I find for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
