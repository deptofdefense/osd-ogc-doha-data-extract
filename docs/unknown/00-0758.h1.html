<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 19, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>In the Applicant's response to the SOR dated May 17, 2001, he elected to have the case determined on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department 
Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on June 5, 2001.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information 
in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on June 11, 2001, and he submitted a response dated June 15, 
2001.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on July 11, 2001. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Applicant is 55 years old, and is employed by a defense contractor as their Chief Financial Officer.  He is applying for a security clearance in connection 
with his employment.</P> 
<P>The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and Guideline in the SOR:</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct involving 
questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Applicant was born in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in 1944.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1948 or 1949, his family fled to Taiwan because the communists were gaining 
control of the PRC.  The family lived in Taiwan, and the Applicant graduated from college in Taiwan.  In 1970, the Applicant came to the United States to 
obtain a higher educational degree, but was forced to drop out when he and his wife had a child, and he needed to go to work to support them.  </SPAN>The Applicant 
became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1987.</P> 
<P>The Applicant completed an application for security clearance dated April 14, 2000, and was asked to give the full name, correct code, and other requested 
information for each of his relatives and associates, living or dead, as specified.  The security clearance application requested, in part, that he list the full name, 
date of birth, country of birth, country(ies) of citizenship, and the current address of his Brother, Sister, Father-in -Law, Mother-in-Law and other relatives.  
(See, Question 9, of Government Exhibit 4).  In addition, under Code 17 (Other Relative), the Applicant was to include only foreign national relatives not listed 
in 1-16 with whom he and his spouse are bound by affection, obligation, or close and continuing contact.  The Applicant listed his mother and father, (both of 
whom are deceased), and his two children (who were born in the United States).  He failed to list his two brothers and one sister, all citizens of Taiwan and 
residing in Taiwan.  He also failed to list his Father-in-Law and Mother-in-Law, both citizens of Mexico and residing in Mexico, and his spouse's seven 
brothers and sisters, all citizens of Mexico and residing in Mexico.  The Applicant explained that he had never applied for a security clearance before, and the 
process was new to him.  He completed the form in a hurry, misread the question, and was not careful with his responses.  (See, Government Exhibit 3 and 
Applicant's Response to File of Relevant Material).  </P> 
<P>When the Applicant was interviewed by the Defense Security Service he was asked to describe his extended family, and he provided the information.  The 
Applicant stated that he provided all relevant information to the Government as soon as he understood the question.  He further stated that under no 
circumstances was he attempting to conceal anything from the Government.</P> 
<P>  </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same security clearance application asked the Applicant, "Have you traveled outside the United States on other than official U.S. Government orders in the 
last seven years?"  The Applicant answered "NO."  This was a false answer.  (See, Question 16, of Government Exhibit 4 dated April 14, 2000).  The Applicant 
failed to list his travel to the PRC on May 15, 1999, and his travel to Taiwan on May 29, 1999, for pleasure.  He also failed to list his travel to the PRC and 
Taiwan in May 1996, for pleasure.  The Applicant stated that again he misunderstood the question.  It never occurred to him that he needed to list his foreign 
travel that he took for pleasure.  He was under the impression that he was to list only official Government travel.  He stated that he provided all relevant 
information to the Government once he understood the question.  (See, Government Exhibit 3 and Applicant's Response to File of Relevant Material). </SPAN></P> 
<P>The same security clearance application required the Applicant to indicate whether he has ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol 
or drugs?  (Regardless of whether the record has been sealed or otherwise stricken from the record).  The Applicant answered "NO".  (See, Question 24, of 
Government Exhibit 4).  The Applicant was arrested for an alcohol related offense in February 1989.  However, there is no evidence that he was ever charged or 
convicted.  The Applicant explained that he did not list the incident because no complaint was ever filed against him, there was no evidence to show that he was 
driving under the influence, and he considered it to be a mistake on the part of the police department for detaining him in the first place.  Government Exhibit 6 
corroborates the fact that no complaint was filed against the Applicant.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly, I find that the Applicant did not intentionally conceal this information 
from the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant's responses to Questions 9 and 16 on his security clearance application of April 14, 2000, concerning his foreign relatives and 
associates, and foreign travel,  were a deliberate attempt to conceal material information from the Government.  The Applicant is an intelligent man who is well 
educated.  The Applicant's responses to the questions were completely false and inaccurate, and he knew or should have known that they were false when he 
provided them to the Government.      <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in criminal conduct 
and violated a Federal criminal statute.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's intentional falsifications on his security clearance application of April 14, 2000, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.(a), and 1.(b), of the SOR, were 
each violations of 18 United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.         </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN>.  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other 
countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has two brothers and a sister and nine nephews and nieces who are citizens of Taiwan and reside in Taiwan.  He has yearly contact with his 
brothers, and converses with his sister about once or twice a month, as she is experiencing some health problems.  He states that his siblings are not involved in 
politics, and are not college educated.  The Applicant provides his siblings no financial support.  He states that they are all business people and anti-communist, 
in support of the United States.  (Government Exhibit 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's spouse was born in Mexico and is a naturalized citizen of the United States.  The Applicant's children were born in the United States. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's Father-in-Law and Mother-in-Law, and his spouse's seven brothers and sisters are citizens of Mexico and reside in Mexico.  The Applicant is 
very close to his wife's parents and provides them with financial support.  They visit the Applicant and his wife in the United States every other year.  The 
Applicant has visited them in Mexico on two occasions in the last seven years.  (Government Exhibit 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides his relatives, the Applicant has no other foreign connections.  He owns no property and has no personal business or  financial interests in Taiwan, the 
PRC or Mexico.  The Applicant has no close associations with any non-United States citizen either in the United States or abroad.     </SPAN></P> 
<P>  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG>      POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of  the 1992 Directive, sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent Guideline.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision 
in any </P> 
<P>case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his or her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own 
unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the 
Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P>5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>: </P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
<P>1.  Any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
<P>None. </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant 
to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member, or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</P> 
<P>a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P> 
<P>b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P>c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
<P>d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
<P>e.  The voluntariness of participation</P> 
<P>f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
<P>g.  The motivation for the conduct </P> 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
<P>  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>The eligibility guidelines established in the DOD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</P> 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination."  The Administrative Judge can draw only 
those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order... shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in personal conduct and criminal conduct that demonstrate poor judgment or unreliability.</P> 
<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</P> 
<P>In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has  engaged in dishonest personal conduct (Guideline E), criminal conduct 
(Guideline J), and is subject to foreign influence (Guideline B).  The Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is intelligent, and well educated in his field.  As Chief Financial Officer of the 
company he knew or should have known how to correctly answer the questions on the security clearance application.  Accordingly, he is held responsible for 
the incorrect, false answers that he put down. </SPAN> The Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application when he attempted to conceal his foreign 
connections and foreign travel in two foreign countries.  This deception  on his application, raises serious doubts about his character, integrity and honesty.  He 
has also violated a Federal criminal statute.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, the Applicant's conduct  shows poor judgment, unreliability and 
untrustworthiness, and falls far short of meeting the eligibility requirements for access to classified information under Guidelines E and J. </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the Applicant has substantial foreign contacts in his personal life.  Although he has no foreign business or financial interests, he 
has significant emotional and family ties in Taiwan and Mexico.  His siblings as well as his nephews and nieces live in Taiwan, and are citizens of Taiwan.  His 
wife's entire family including her Father and Mother and her seven brothers and sisters, not to mention their children, live in, and are citizens of, Mexico.  The 
Applicant provides them with financial support.  The Applicant and his wife maintain continuing and regular contact with their families in Taiwan and Mexico.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Applicant was not forthright in revealing his foreign family ties on his security clearance application.  This raises even more questions as to 
whether the potential for foreign influence exists.  It is the Applicant's burden to show that these ties are not of a nature that could create the potential for 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  He has not done so.  Accordingly, I cannot say that he would not be vulnerable to 
foreign influence.  The risk is considerable, and is of present security significance.  Accordingly, the Applicant's request for a security clearance must be denied 
under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
<P>In addition, the Applicant failed to offer any independent evidence from people who know him well, such as family, friends, coworkers, or supervisors that 
could attest to his trustworthiness.  It is not clear from the evidence that the Applicant has gained the necessary insight into the seriousness of his conduct, or 
whether he is prepared to act honestly and responsibly in the future.  There is no evidence of rehabilitation to any extent.  Consequently, I cannot conclude that 
he is now a reliable and trustworthy individual.  </P> 
<P>Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case. On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>
