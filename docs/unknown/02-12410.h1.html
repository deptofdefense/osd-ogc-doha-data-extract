<P>Applicant was convicted in June 1973 of two counts of embezzlement for having used his position as a clerk tasked with issuing food stamps to steal 
approximately $4,600.00. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail. On reconsideration in August 1973, he was released from jail after 43 days and he was 
continued on supervised probation for two years. In October 1973, while on probation, Applicant was arrested for felony armed robbery, a charge that was 
dismissed before trial for lack of evidence. Because he received a jail sentence in excess of one year, 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 applies to disqualify Applicant from 
receiving a security clearance. Clearance is denied. However, Applicant has lived without incident as a solid, law-abiding citizen for the past 30 years. I 
recommend further consideration of his case for meritorious waiver.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 23, 2003 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise 
security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOHA 
adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security 
clearance.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On February 15, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2003. On April 16, 2003, 
DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting this case to be heard on May 13, 2003. Thereafter, Applicant requested a continuance to which Department Counsel 
did not object. I granted Applicant's request and re-scheduled the hearing for May 22, 2003. All parties appeared as scheduled and the government presented six 
exhibits (GE 1 through 6). Applicant relied on 17 exhibits (AE A through Q), which were admitted without objection, on his own testimony and on that of three 
witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on June 2, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 51-years-old. When he was 18-years-old, he went to work for the state food stamp program as a clerk assigned to distribute food stamps. In the 
summer of 1972, a state audit of the food stamp program</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> showed approximately $1,800.00 in cash and food stamps unaccounted for during a two month period. 
When asked about the audit discrepancies, Applicant admitted to having embezzled more than $3,000.00 from the food stamp program over the previous 10 
months. Subsequently, a full audit for the prior year showed a cash and food stamp shortfall of $4,646.25.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On November 2, 1972, he was arrested and charged with 10 violations of five sections of the state criminal code. Specifically, he was charged with felony 
embezzlement of state funds (two counts), grand larceny (two counts), grand receiving (two counts), petty larceny (two counts), and petty receiving (two 
counts). On May 2, 1973, he pled guilty to two counts of embezzlement and was sentenced to incarceration for 18 months, the last 15 months of his sentence to 
be suspended on payment of restitution. He was released after less than two months, but was still subject to two years supervised probation.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant joined the Army in November 1972<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> - after he was arrested, but before he was convicted and sentenced. When the Army became aware Applicant 
had to return home to stand trial, it initiated discharge proceedings. In August 1973, after he was released from jail, he petitioned the Army to allow him to 
remain in the Army if he could convince the court to release him from jail.  On August 23, 1973, the Army decided to retain Applicant on active duty where he 
remained for the next 26 years.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The Army's decision also had the effect of terminating his supervised probation if he remained in the service for the two year 
term of probation originally imposed.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In October 1973, Applicant was arrested and charged with armed robbery. He had been riding in a car with three other men when they stopped at a gas station. 
Two of the men went inside while Applicant and the fourth person stayed in the car. The first two men assaulted and robbed a gas station employee. All four 
were arrested a short time later and all were charged with armed robbery. Bail was set at $20,000.00, which Applicant could not afford to pay. Thus, he 
remained in jail for five months while awaiting trial, but the charges against him were dropped when one of the other defendants, who had originally implicated 
Applicant as an accomplice, changed his story during  trial.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant credibly insists he did not know beforehand that the other men in the car intended to rob 
the gas station.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant went on to have a solid military career as evidenced by the many letters of appreciation and commendation submitted.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> After leaving the military in 
1999, Applicant went to work for his current employer, a defense contractor whose contracts with DoD require Applicant to hold a clearance. Applicant has 
held a secret clearance since at least August 1992.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He is highly regarded by friends and co-workers who testified in his behalf for his integrity, reliability, and 
truthfulness. Testimony from the government manager where he works, a retired Navy admiral, and the pastor at Applicant's church, all of whom have known 
Applicant for several years and have frequent, close contact with him, revealed the following: Applicant is a dedicated family man who has immersed himself 
in his work and in good works through his church. Applicant spends several hours each day outside work in service to other families and individuals. He was 
unanimously approved as a deacon at his church on the first ballot. His performance at work is characterized by thorough professionalism and reliability. All of 
the persons who testified for Applicant were impressive in their bearing and sincerity. Further, each witness had some knowledge of Applicant's past 
misconduct, but remained enthusiastic in recommending Applicant for a position of trust.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant challenges, through oral argument at hearing and in a post-hearing brief, the applicability of 10 U.S.C. &sect;986 (hereinafter &sect;986). Applicant asserts that, 
because subsequent state court action in the form of reconsideration reduced his jail sentence to a term less than one year, &sect;986 should not apply.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> I disagree 
with Applicant and have concluded, based on a review of the evidence, consideration of Applicant's argument at hearing, and post-hearing briefs submitted by  
Appellant and Department Counsel, and pursuant to Appeal Board precedence on this issue, that &sect;986 applies in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was sentenced in June 1973 to 18 months in jail with 15 months suspended once he met certain court-imposed conditions. Applicant essentially 
argues that the sentence reconsideration by the state court negates the original 18-month sentence, thus removing Applicant's sentence from the ambit of &sect;986. 
The Appeal Board has issued two decisions<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> addressing the effect on &sect;986 application of subsequent state court action modifying an initial sentence of more 
than a year in jail. Both times, the Board has held that, absent specific Congressional intent to the contrary, state action may not supercede the requirements of a 
federal statute such as &sect;986. Further, the presence of relief albeit limited through the meritorious waiver provisions of &sect;986 indicates that Congress considered 
including exceptions to the statute. They evidently declined to include as a statutory exception the fairly common occurrence in state courts of sentence 
reconsideration and other post-sentencing actions. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In support of his position, Applicant has offered an analogy between the DOHA decision-making process and that of another federal agency faced with similar 
questions of sentence modification and the legal effects thereof.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> As appealing as that analogy is, I decline to use it as justification for expanding my authority 
in these matters. DOHA Administrative Judges only have the authority to manage and decide cases according to the requirements of DoD Directive 5220.6 as 
implemented by applicable DOHA Operating Instructions, as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, and as clarified by the Office of the Secretary of Defense 
or his authorized designees. Absent guidance or Appeal Board precedence to the contrary, that another agency may address similar questions of law in a 
different manner has no bearing on this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As factual matter, Applicant asserts the state court "re-sentenced" Applicant; that is, it did not suspend Applicant's 18-month sentence, as alleged, but vacated 
the original sentence and substituted a new, less severe sentence which would not otherwise invoke &sect;986. He urges that AE A and not GE 6 is the best source of 
information about what the court did. However, a review of both documents clearly shows the court suspended the remaining period of incarceration in less 
than the three months originally stated conditioned on Applicant's payment of full restitution, and placed Applicant on two years supervised probation. Nothing 
in any of the evidence admitted in this case shows the court at any time relinquished its control over Applicant's freedom should he fail to abide by the court's 
terms. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In short, this case is virtually indistinguishable from cases where all or part of a jail sentence in excess of one year is suspended on condition of probation, 
alcohol counseling, restitution or any number of other terms imposed by the court. The court's intent and ability to incarcerate the defendant are still in play 
should he not meet the court's requirements. The fact this or any other Applicant does not actually serve jail time of more than one year is irrelevant by terms of 
the statute and implementing guidance. All that occurred here was that the Applicant was successful in accelerating his release from incarceration. The original 
sentence contemplated release after three months on payment of restitution. The court was clearly ready to jail Applicant for more than a year had he been 
unable to make restitution. On reconsideration, Applicant was released after less than two months. The remaining terms of sentence were virtually unchanged.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based on the foregoing and on the facts as discussed below, I conclude that &sect;986 applies and have applied its requirements accordingly.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline J  (Criminal Conduct) is the relevant adjudicative guideline to 
be applied here.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in 
ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
Government.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). </STRONG>The security concern under Guideline J is that</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> The government has established through its documentary evidence and through Applicant's admissions that 
Applicant was engaged in criminal conduct in 1972 and, through unintentional association with persons he did not know very well, in 1973. Disqualifying 
Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 2<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply. By contrast, Mitigating Condition (MC) 1<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies due to the passage of more than 30 years since his last criminal act. 
Because he was an unwitting party to the 1973 armed robbery, I conclude he did not engage in further criminal conduct after 1972. Therefore, MC 2<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN> also 
applies as his criminal conduct consists of a single event. Finally, and most importantly, this record thoroughly supports application of MC 6.<A HREF="02-12410.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant's 
outstanding military career, the fact he has lived his entire adult life as a law-abiding citizen who has held a clearance since 1992 without incident, and is 
respected and admired both at work and in his community speaks volumes about his suitability for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>I have carefully weighed all of the evidence in this case, and I have applied the aforementioned disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each 
applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But for the application of </SPAN>&sect;986<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, I would grant Applicant's 
request for clearance. Clearance is denied.</SPAN></P>
