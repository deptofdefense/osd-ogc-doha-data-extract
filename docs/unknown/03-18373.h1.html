<P>Applicant with an otherwise meritorious professional record engaged in an act of public indecency with a park conservation officer in 2000 and was arrested 
and fined as a result of his actions.  Initially concealing the encounters from his wife, family and friends out of personal embarrassment, he has since made a 
clean disclosure to his spouse and assures his family and friends know about his indiscretion.  Overall, he mitigates security concerns arising out of the 
personal, criminal and sexual behavior aspects of his actions.  However, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns associated with his concealing the 
material arrest/conviction in his SF-86 and failing to disclose it to the interviewing DSS agent for over two years, and only after being confronted with it.   
Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 17, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on June 10, 2004, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on August 2, 2004, and is credited with receiving it on August 11, 2004.  Applicant  responded to the FORM within the 30 days 
provided him with supplemental documentation regarding his public indecency arrest and his ensuing divorce from his spouse.  The case was assigned to me on 
September 7, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application  (SF-86) of October 26, 2001 by omitting his October 2000 arrest 
and charges of public indecency, for which he was fined $100.00. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline D, Applicant's indecency arrest is incorporated.  Applicant is alleged to prefer that his wife, family, and professional colleagues not know 
about his public indecency arrest.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He added a number of explanations.  He claimed his arrest was the result of a mistake 
on his part. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of  a defense contractors  who seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to 
by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2000 Applicant approached a man in a state park and engaged him in a conversation.  Applicant pulled down his pants and touched his genitals.  
Applicant later learned that the man he approached was a state conservation officer (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).  Applicant was subsequently arrested for indecent exposure and 
fined $100.00.  Applicant's only explanation for his exposing himself was that he consumed a few beers beforehand and knew the park from prior fishing 
experience and word of mouth to be a place where sexual activity occurred.  Out of embarrassment, he did not tell his wife, family, and coworkers of his 
extemporaneous actions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Until recently, Applicant kept his indecent exposure arrest a secret from his spouse of 23 years, his 16-year old son, and his friends and coworkers.  When he 
finally elected to disclose the incident and his lifestyle to his wife in July 2004, she filed for divorce and sole custody of their minor son.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2001, Applicant completed an updated security clearance application furnished him by his employer.  Answering question 26 (inquiring about his 
police record), Applicant answered "no."  In so doing, he knowingly and wilfully omitted his October 2000 public indecency arrest out of embarrassment.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When interviewed by a DSS agent in June 2003, Applicant initially declined to acknowledge his public indecency arrest.  After some prodding from the agent 
and "a couple of false starts," Applicant disclosed his October 2000 arrest and details of the incident (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Sexual Behavior</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Concern: </EM>Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of 
the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance 
and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from 
the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is an experienced employee of a defense contractor who comes to these proceedings with no history of involvement with law enforcement before his 
arrest and fine in 2000 for public indecency.  While just a misdemeanor offense, it involved sexual behavior in the presence of a park conversation officer, 
which Applicant failed to disclose to his wife, family and coworkers until just recently. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For several years, Applicant withheld his sexual encounter from his family and coworkers out of embarrassment.  Applicant admits the encounters and the poor 
judgment reflected in each of them.  Applicant's actions are covered by several disqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for sexual behavior: 
E2.A4.2.1 (<EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the  individual has been prosecuted</EM>),  E2.A4.1.2.3 (<EM>Sexual behavior that causes and individual 
to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>), and E2.A4.2.4 (<EM>Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion of 
judgment</EM>).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To his credit, Applicant elected to tell his wife once he received the FORM and  assures that his family and friends are now aware of his indiscretion.   His 
disclosures are acknowledged by his spouse, who responded with her initiation of divorce proceedings.  With  his spouse, family and friends since notified, the 
risks of any renascent vulnerability would appear to be minimized and manageable for security clearance purposes.  Applicant may take full advantage of 
E2.A4.1.3.4 <EM>(The behavior no longer serves as basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>) of the Guidelines for sexual behavior.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's only documented public indecency encounter in 2000, Applicant makes the convincing 
case that his acts are sufficiently isolated against a history of his living as a law abiding and responsible citizen.  Both the isolated nature of the offense and 
credits to Applicant's overall character (using whole person assessment)  enable him to carry his evidentiary burden.  Favorable conclusions warrant with 
respect to the subparagraphs covered by Guideline D.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More difficult to reconcile with principles of clearance eligibility is Applicant's  omission of his 2000  public indecency arrest/fine when he responding to 
question 26 of his October 2001 SF-86.  Embarrassment over his arrest is understandable but is generally insufficient to avert inferences of knowing and wilful 
omission of material facts considered necessary to complete a security clearance investigation.  E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification 
or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities</EM>) of Guideline E is applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because Applicant did not acknowledge his 2000 arrest until confronted with the material facts by an interviewing DSS agent in June 2003 (over two years 
later), he may not take advantage of either E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided 
correct information voluntarily</EM>) or E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the 
facts</EM>).  The Appeal Board has been very explicit about the unavailability of this mitigation condition without both prongs being met.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR OSD No. 93-1390 (January 1995).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, including Applicant's satisfactory professional history and unblemished criminal record (save for his 2000 encounter), 
Applicant's mitigation efforts are still insufficient to (a) surmount his omission of his 2000 arrest under governing Guideline and Appeal Board interpretations 
and (b) restore his judgment and reliability to levels required for eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraph 1.a of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 .2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
