<P>The Applicant's improper use of his company computer to access pornographic sites on the internet in 1999, in violation of company policy resulting in his 
employment termination, and his attempt to intentionally conceal this information on his security clearance application in 2003, has not been mitigated.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on February 21, 2005, in which he elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  
Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on April 11, 2005, consisting of six Government 
Exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 
days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on April 25, 2005, and he submitted a  response dated May 16, 2005.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to the undersigned for resolution on July 7, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the documents.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 51 years of age, and is employed by a 
defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While employed for a defense contractor, on February 11, 1999, the Applicant accessed 66 pornographic sites on the internet from his company computer.  He 
spent a total of four and a half hours that day engaged in this conduct.  On February 12, 1999, he accessed 75 pornographic sites  on the internet from his 
company computer. This time he spent about one hour and ten minutes accessing these sites.  The Applicant explained that he became aware of the growing 
problem with young people accessing inappropriate sites (pornography) on the internet.  As a parent with two teenagers the Applicant explained that he was 
concerned about the ease at which his children could access pornography on the internet.  He decided to see for himself what he could randomly find.  (<EM>See 
</EM>Government Exhibits 3 and 6).  The Applicant further explained that he did not down load or print any material and had no idea how much actual time he had 
spent on the company computer.  The Applicant did not have a computer at home so he used the one he had at work.  The Applicant was subsequently 
terminated for violation of company policy.  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 4).     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 6, 2003, the Applicant completed a security clearance application.  In response to question 20, concerning his employment record, he was asked if 
in the last ten years he was ever fired from job, etc.   The Applicant answered, "YES", and indicated that he was terminated from his employment in March 
1999, for misuse of office equipment by accessing the internet on the company computer to obtain driving directions to airports, hotels and subcontractors 
locations.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 5).  This was not the truth.  The Applicant was actually terminated by his employer in March 1999 for using his company 
computer during business hours to access pornographic sites on the internet.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to this same question on the same application, the Applicant also listed that he was terminated from another employer in 2000, a year later, for 
misuse of office equipment, "incorrectly and wrongly".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 5).  The Applicant did not elaborate further as to what he specifically did to 
cause this termination.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the FORM, the Applicant states that he regrets his actions in the past that led to his termination in 1999, and that he has paid a huge price for 
his mistake.  He has been working his way back into his career to show that he is a trustworthy individual and employee.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> <STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors 
and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These 
factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in 
any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique 
facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings 
of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.     The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, 
or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or pressure;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; to include violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be 
considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the 
evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized 
by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall 
in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who demonstrates a disregard for security policies and procedure, or who engages in a pattern of rule violations, may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a 
security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility, this 
Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's misuse of information 
technology systems and his personal conduct has a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was terminated in 1999 for violating his company's policy prohibiting the improper use of his company computer to access pornographic sites on 
the internet.  The Applicant acted deliberately and with reckless disregard of his company's policies.  Following that termination, a year later, in 2000, the 
Applicant was terminated again by another one of his employers.  There is no evidence in the record to explain what specifically brought on this second 
termination.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, there is evidence that he was terminated for violating company policy.   Although both employment terminations occurred five years 
ago, it was only two years ago, in 2003, that he filled out the security clearance application for his present employment and intentionally failed to disclose the 
truth in response the question 20 concerning the reasons for his termination in 1999.  Therefore, I consider this behavior recent.  I cannot find that the Applicant 
has matured, rehabilitated himself or changed his behavior.  This behavior shows extremely poor judgment.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions (2) <EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel 
security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or 
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, (4) Personal conduct or concealment of information that 
increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or pressure</EM> and<EM> (5) A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; to include violation of any 
written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency </EM>apply.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.<EM> </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I 
find against the Applicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, the Applicant has not provided this Administrative Judge with sufficient evidence in mitigation that would negate the negative impact his poor 
judgment has had on his security worthiness.  At this time, I cannot find that it is clearly consistent with the national interests to grant the Applicant a security 
clearance.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has  not rebutted the Government's case regarding his personal conduct.  The Applicant has not met the mitigating 
conditions of Guideline E of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline E.</SPAN></P>
