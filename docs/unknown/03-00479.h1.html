<P>Applicant's pattern of financial irresponsibility, criminal conduct, and falsifications renders him an unsuitable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance 
denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 16 October 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-00479.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> recommending denial or revocation 
of Applicant's clearance.  Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record on 3 November 2003. He responded to the 
Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), issued 3 February 2004; the record in this case closed 24 February 2004, the day Department Counsel 
indicated no objection to the response was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 4 May 2004 to decide if clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted  the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He previously had a clearance in the early 1990s.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of dishonesty, false reporting, and falsification leading to adverse housing, criminal, and employment consequences. He also has a 
history of financial irresponsibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 1997, Applicant was charged with making a false report to law enforcement and was fined and placed on one-year probation. In May 2001, he was 
terminated from his job for unauthorized use of a company vehicle and then lying to the company about the circumstances of the incident. Also, in May 2001, 
he was evicted from his apartment for violation of the terms of his lease by allowing unauthorized people to stay in the apartment during the day, including an 
individual the rental company had barred from the property.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 1 May 2001, Applicant falsified his Security Clearance Application (SCA) by failing to disclose his November 1997 arrest for false report, by failing to 
disclose his delinquent debts, and by failing to disclose three significant periods of residence within the last seven years. Although he truthfully disclosed that 
he had been fired from a job for unauthorized use of a company vehicle, he provided a false explanation of the circumstances of that firing in a 26 July 2002 
sworn statement. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has six delinquent credit accounts totaling over $15,000.00, that  fell delinquent between January 1992 and April 2001. None of these debts were 
caused by circumstances beyond Applicant's control. Three of the six debts are medical bills totaling less than $1,000.00. Although Applicant has provided 
corroboration that he entered into a debt repayment plan with a credit counseling organization and asserts that he has been making payments on the plan, he has 
provided no payment records to corroborate the claimed payments.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record is otherwise silent on Applicant's character or work performance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment. . . divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CRIMINAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE J)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.1. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and  material matters to an investigator, . . . in connection with a 
personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to an 
applicant to establish security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record demonstrates Applicant's substantial indebtedness, but contains no corroboration of 
claimed payments made pursuant to a credit counseling repayment plan executed in June 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial difficulties are both recent and not isolated; indeed they are ongoing. 
They do not appear to be due to circumstances beyond his control. It does not appear that Applicant has stopped digging himself into a financial hole, much less 
started to pull himself out of it. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline E. Applicant falsified substantial pieces of his criminal record and financial difficulties, and later lied 
to the Government about the reason for his firing--just as he lied to his company about the misuse of the company vehicle, precipitating the firing. I conclude 
Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's arrest for false report is simply one more instance in which Applicant has displayed 
dishonest conduct. I conclude Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
