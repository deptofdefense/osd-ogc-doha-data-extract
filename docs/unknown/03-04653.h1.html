<P>Applicant mitigated the personal and criminal conduct concerns raised by his falsification of information submitted to the government in a recent security 
clearance application (SF 86) and through a subject interview during his background investigation. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>After reviewing the results of Applicant's background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make 
a preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On January 10, 2005, DOHA issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline E (personal conduct) and 
Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant timely submitted a responsive pleading, and requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on October 3, 2005, and I convened a hearing on November 17, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government 
presented two exhibits, which were admitted without objection. Applicant presented 19 exhibits, which were admitted without objection. He also testified in his 
own behalf and presented the testimony of four other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on December 1, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 50 years old and has been employed by a major defense contractor in support of various military aviation initiatives since October 1995. He has 
been married and divorced twice, most recently in 2001 from his second wife whom he married in 1979. They had three children together, all of whom are now 
in their 20s. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1973 until his honorable discharge as a petty officer second class (paygrade E-5) in 1979. Thereafter he 
earned his  graduate equivalent degree, having dropped out of high school to join the service. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree and a masters degree. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has held a security clearance without interruption or incident since 1973. He submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on May 16, 2002, to 
initiate a periodic review of his suitability for clearance and a possible increase of his level of access from secret to top secret.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to assuming his current position, Applicant worked for a defense contractor that eventually merged with his current employer, and was assigned to the 
U.S. Navy's Kuwaiti Air Force support program. His duties required he travel to Kuwait for long assignments. He had previously been assigned to a similar 
position in support of the Royal Saudi Air Force and spent over two years in Saudi Arabia. In March 1995, while assigned to Kuwait, Applicant and a fellow 
contractor were illegally seized at the Kuwait/Iraq border by Iraqi troops and detained until July 1995 in Iraq at various locations, including Abu Ghraib prison. 
He was interrogated several times each day, lost 40 pounds, contracted hepatitis from various injections Iraqi guards gave him, and was in fear of his life most 
of the time he was held there. On being debriefed after his release, it was determined Applicant had not divulged any classified information to his captors.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant returned to the United States, he was lauded in his hometown and in the national press as a hero. The attention he received in the months 
following his return, his medical problems, and what was eventually diagnosed as post-traumatic stress syndrome all took a toll on his personal life. Applicant 
began to drink more than he had in the past, and his relationship with his wife and children suffered. He and his wife separated in 1999, and their divorce 
became final in 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been charged with and/or arrested for three alcohol-related criminal offenses. In May 1977, while in the Navy, he was arrested for being drunk in 
public. He was held in jail overnight and eventually paid a $30 fine. In December 1978, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and two 
related moving violations. There is no definitive information available about the disposition of this charge. In September 1999, Applicant was pulled over while 
on business-related travel. He had been drinking earlier in the evening, but refused to take a breathalyser test. He was arrested and charged with DUI, but did 
not have to appear in court and paid a $500 court-ordered contribution to a charitable organization.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant submitted his SF 86 in May 2002, Applicant disclosed his 1978 DUI charge, but omitted both his 1977 drunk in public charge and his 1999 
DUI charge. As to the 1977 offense, Applicant asserts he forgot about that arrest, but also averred he had disclosed this incident in previous security clearance 
applications and had discussed it with government investigators. Applicant has admitted he deliberately omitted his 1999 arrest because he was embarrassed 
that he should have engaged in such conduct after being treated as a hero following his return from Iraq.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by government investigators in June 2002 as part of his background investigation. He did not disclose his 1999 DUI during this 
interview. He was re-interviewed in November 2003 and discussed his 1999 arrest as well as his past and current drinking habits. Among the details he 
disclosed in this interview was the fact he had been treated for hepatitis beginning around November 2001 and was unable to drink alcohol until September 
2002. Since then, Applicant has greatly moderated his drinking.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having personally assessed his demeanor and response to questioning at his hearing, I find his testimony was credible and devoid of any attempt to evade 
responsibility for his actions or to minimize the full impact of his actions. He is regarded as a solid, honest, and thoroughly professional employee and neighbor. 
He submitted extensive recommendations from several fellow employees who have an average of at least 20 years experience in the defense industry and in the 
military. Included in these recommendations is a letter from the U.S. diplomat who negotiated Applicant's release from Iraq and who is now a state governor. 
But perhaps the most salient document presented is the results of a survey completed by Applicant's subordinates as periodic feedback on how well Applicant 
performs his job as a site manager. The results were very positive, but significantly so in terms of his subordinates' trust in Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> for consideration in evaluating an applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Further, security 
clearance decisions must reflect consideration of disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances 
of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive.<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The presence 
or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are Guideline E (personal 
conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security concern may arise if it is shown an applicant has exhibited  questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such conduct may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified 
information.<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Here, the government questioned Applicant's trustworthiness by alleging he deliberately omitted from his SF 86 his September 1999 DUI arrest 
(SOR &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a(1)) and his March 1977 public drunkenness arrest (SOR &para; 1.a(2)). The government also alleged Applicant deliberately lied to a government 
investigator during a June 17, 2002, subject interview by failing to disclose his September 1999 DUI (SOR &para; 1.b), and by claiming he had abstained from 
alcohol since 1995, whereas he stated in a subsequent interview that he had continued to drink after 1995 (SOR &para; 1.c).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find for the Applicant as to SOR &para;&para; 1.a(2) and 1.c. To be disqualifying, these omissions must have been made with intent to mislead or deceive the 
government in its investigation of Applicant's background. Applicant's explanation that he forgot about his 1977 arrest is plausible and it is uncontroverted that 
this information had also been disclosed during previous background investigations. Regarding his statement in a June 2002 interview about abstinence from 
alcohol, Applicant denies this allegation, thus keeping the burden on the government to support this charge. Apart from Applicant's admission to SOR &para; 1.b, 
and his signed statement from a November 2003 interview, there is no record of what he did or did not say in the first interview. Again, Applicant provides a 
plausible explanation. Specifically, he claims he told the investigator that he had suffered from hepatitis after his 1995 release, that the treatment from 
November 2001 until September 2002 required he abstain from alcohol, and that, at the time of the June 2002 interview he was not drinking.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.a(1), and 1.b, the record shows, through the government's exhibits and Applicant's admissions and testimony, that he 
deliberately made two false statements to the government through his SF 86 and at his June 2002 interview. Based on available information, Guideline E 
disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> DC 3<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, none of the listed mitigating conditions (MC) apply. The information about his 1999 DUI was 
material to the government's assessment of his background, especially as it appears his drinking had been examined in previous background checks. Further, 
Applicant's falsifications were recent as they occurred during his current background investigation. Nor were they isolated in that he deliberately omitted 
information from his SF 86, and repeated his falsification when he was interviewed by government investigators the first time. On this issue, it should be noted 
that there was no direct question asked about his 1999 DUI, but Applicant apparently knew he should have discussed it with the investigator and admittedly 
withheld that information anyway. The fact he did not admit to his 1999 DUI until his second interview also precludes a finding he made any prompt, good-faith effort to correct his falsification before being confronted with the facts. There is no indication his answers to the SF 86 or his discussions during interviews 
were influenced by anyone or that he received any counsel to make such representations. Lastly, this is not a case where Applicant is possibly vulnerable to 
coercion, blackmail, or pressure because of his conduct. This case is strictly about Applicant's judgment and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While none of the listed mitigating conditions apply here, I note that the adjudicative guidelines are just that - guidelines. They need not be applied in a rigid 
manner that does not allow for consideration of other factors or that would produce an inequitable result. Often times the government's security concerns are 
not about underlying adverse conduct, but about a person's willingness to protect the national interests by telling the truth even at the expense of one's own 
interests. Here, we have a clear case of an applicant who withheld information the government needed because he was embarrassed. Balanced against that 
conduct is information that demonstrates Applicant can be relied on to protect the national interests under the most dire personal circumstances one can 
imagine. The record also contains recommendations and testimonials from as broad, reliable, and experienced a cross-section of professional and personal 
references as could be encountered in these proceedings. That information suggests this is an Applicant whose falsifications are an aberrational error in 
judgment that, when examined in light of his years of service and excellence to the defense industry at home and abroad, is not likely to recur. I conclude 
Guideline E in favor of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also alleged Applicant's deliberate falsifications constituted criminal conduct insofar as they violated federal law under 10 U.S.C. 1001 (SOR 
&para; 2.a). Criminal conduct is a security concern because a person who is willing to disregard the law </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and risk fines or incarceration may also be willing to 
disregard rules and regulations governing the protection of classified information.<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Available information is sufficient to support this allegation as it relates 
back to SOR 1.a(1) and 1.b. Based on these allegations, Guideline J DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and DC 2<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, the record also supports application of Guideline J MC 6.<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> For the same reasons discussed under Guideline E, above, it is apparent that Applicant's 
decisions regarding his SF 86 and his first subject interview will not be repeated. Through the many testimonials presented about his record over the past 30 
years, and the fact he has accepted full responsibility for his actions, Applicant has presented clear evidence of rehabilitation. When examined in light of all the 
information that bears on this issue, Applicant has overcome the government's concerns and I conclude Guideline J for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guideline. 
A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-04653.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> of information about Applicant's personal conduct and the criminal aspects of that conduct, taken in the context of all of 
the information before me shows that he has overcome any reasonable doubts about his judgment and reliability. His falsifications of his SF 86 and his 
statements to investigators raise legitimate questions about his judgment and trustworthiness; however, he has answered satisfactorily those questions through 
significant and sufficient information that indicates his transgressions are unlikely to recur. Accordingly, Applicant has overcome the government's case for 
disqualification.</SPAN></P>
