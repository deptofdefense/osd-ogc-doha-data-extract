<P>Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns involving alcohol abuse, personal conduct and misuse of a prescription drug. He continues to use alcohol after 
diagnosis of alcohol dependence and admitted to misuse of a painkiller for other purposes and failing to report it on his Security Clearance Application (SF 86). 
No mitigating conditions were established. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry, </EM>as amended and 
modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, 
as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated December 9, 2004, to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. It 
was received by Applicant on November 12, 2004. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement dated January 17, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on March 29, 2005, requesting to amend the SOR to allege an 
additional security concern of drug involvement for use of prescription medication over a ten year period in a manner that deviated from approved direction. A 
complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit any additional material and filed no objection to the proposed amendment to the SOR so the 
amendment was made. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2005.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR but offered some explanatory information in his answer and statements given to the investigating officer. 
After a complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is a 50-year-old technician employed by a defense contractor since 1988. He has had alcohol problems and was arrested for alcohol related driving 
offenses in 1999 and 2001. He was fined and given suspended sentences. After the second offense he was ordered t be evaluated for alcohol abuse and placed 
on probation. He received treatment from January 2003 until January 2004.  He dropped out of the program briefly during that period until reminded by the 
Defense Security Service (DSS) that he was obliged to finish it pursuant to his probation. He did so, completing 34 required sessions. He was diagnosed with 
alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker in a recognized alcohol treatment program (Exhibit 6). The diagnosis also included misuse of 
prescription painkillers (Exh. 9). He stopped use of alcohol for two months during his treatment but began again in May 2003. He continues to use alcohol but 
in moderation. The continued use of alcohol is contrary to the plan developed for him by the program. He misused a diagnosed prescription painkiller with 
varied frequency over a period of time between 1993 and 2003.</P> 
<P>Applicant failed to report the drug misuse at Question 27 on his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) dated December 19, 2000. Applicant denied the 
omission was deliberate citing various physical ailments that prompted the use of the painkiller. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and</P> 
<P>maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; 
E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive 
Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has cited a Disqualifying Condition (DC) pursuant to the Directive concerning alcohol consumption under Guideline G. This relates to 
excessive alcohol consumption that leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, and unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. (E2.A7.1.1) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying 
include evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment 
program. (E2.A7.1.2.4) This evidence was established and no mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant continues to drink despite a diagnosis of alcohol 
dependence and there is no proof of positive changes in his behavior. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant's failure to report his drug misuse on his SF 86 indicates questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) Specifically, the deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. 
(E2.A5.1.2.2.) His statement in his answer that he did not regard it as misuse at the time of its use because he had a number of other ailments as a result of 
accidents is insufficient to mitigate the allegation as he now recognizes that he used the drug inappropriately to make him "feel better" and that it was wrong to 
do so (Exh. 6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government amended the SOR to include disqualifying condition (DC) 1 under Guideline H concerning drug involvement. Drug involvement is always a 
security concern because it raises questions about a person's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Any drug abuse is a condition that may be 
disqualifying. The following definition is provided: "Drug abuse includes "the use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction." 
(E2.A8.1.1.3) Applicant admitted improper use of the drug over approximately ten years from 1993 until 2003. Since the misuse of the drug was within the last 
two years, was over a long period of time and no evidence was offered to show that it would not recur, no mitigating conditions are applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has held a position of trust 
with his company for 17 years but has offered no evidence to counter the proof and admission of the conduct that disqualify him from holding a security 
clearance. After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</SPAN></P>
