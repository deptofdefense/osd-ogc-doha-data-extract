  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Applicant had a reasonable opportunity to submit record evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider in her case during the proceedings below.  The legal availability of filing for bankruptcy does not preclude a Judge from considering  the overall history of an applicant's financial difficulties.  Given the record evidence of Applicant's repeated use of the bankruptcy process over the past  20 years -- with Applicant having recurring financial difficulties despite the financial relief provided by each bankruptcy discharge -- it was not  unreasonable for the Judge to decide that Applicant's recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing did not demonstrate financial reform and rehabilitation that  warranted a conclusion that Applicant had successfully overcome her long history of recurring financial difficulties and was not likely to have them  again.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 18, 2003, which stated the 
reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations).  Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated September 9, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant still owed approximately $49,000 in 
unsatisfied debts; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant had successfully mitigated her financial difficulties.  For 
the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether 
there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify 
how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 
00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or 
(2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary 
or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it 
reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the 
record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) 
at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether 
they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not 
required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are 
supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the 
same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, 
but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect 
a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party 
challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 
4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant still owed approximately $49,000 in unsatisfied debts</SPAN>.  Applicant does not challenge 
the Administrative Judge's findings of fact about her history of financial difficulties, which included: (a) Applicant resorting to Chapter 7 bankruptcies in 
1983, 1991, and 1998; and (b) Applicant filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in June 2002 that covered approximately $49,000 in unsatisfied 
debts.  However, Applicant contends the Judge erred by finding that she still had $49,000 in unsatisfied debts.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's claim of error lacks merit.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge properly found the debts covered by 
Applicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition were still not satisfied.  Applicant's claim that $46,000 of those debts have been satisfied through the 
Chapter 13 process is based on a proffer of new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-21274 (January 8, 2004) at p. 3 (there is no general legal right to continuously supplement the 
record evidence in a case).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant had a reasonable opportunity to submit record evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider in her case during the proceedings below.  
Applicant cannot fairly challenge the Judge's findings or conclusions based on a proffer of evidence on appeal that was not made available for the 
Judge to consider during the proceedings below.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by not concluding Applicant had successfully mitigated her financial difficulties</SPAN>.  Applicant also contends the 
Administrative Judge erred by not concluding her filing of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy was sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance decision 
based on application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6.<A HREF="02-21045.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  This contention is not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The legal availability of filing for bankruptcy does not preclude the Administrative Judge from considering the overall history of an applicant's financial 
difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 4.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at pp. 5-6 (in order 
to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must do more than just show that he or she has relied on a legally 
available option such as bankruptcy).  The filing of a bankruptcy petition is not evidence that the debts covered by the petition will be successfully 
discharged or resolved.  Moreover, given the record evidence of Applicant's repeated use of the bankruptcy process over the past 20 years -- with 
Applicant having recurring financial difficulties despite the financial relief provided by each bankruptcy discharge -- it was not unreasonable for the 
Judge to decide that Applicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2002 did not demonstrate financial reform and rehabilitation that warranted a 
conclusion that Applicant had successfully overcome her long history of recurring financial difficulties and was not likely to have them again.</P>
