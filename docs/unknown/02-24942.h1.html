<P>Applicant was born and raised in Israel.  He mitigated security concerns raised by his dual citizenship by renouncing his Israeli citizenship and returning his 
Israeli passport.  Applicant was unable to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns raised by his parents, sister, extended family members, and friends

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 13 May 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="02-24942.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 7 June 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was 
assigned to me on 29 July 2004.  On 24 August 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 10 September 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 42-year-old engineering manager for a defense contractor.  He was born and raised in Israel.  He served his mandatory Israeli military service 
from 1982-86, attaining the rank of master sergeant.  He held a top secret Israeli clearance to perform his duties in systems engineering; he installed and 
repaired electronic equipment.</P> 
 
<P>After he completed his military service, Applicant immigrated to the U.S., where he married a U.S. born woman he had met in Israel when she was a student.  
Applicant and his wife have two children, both U.S. citizens by birth.  Applicant became a U.S. citizen is April 1989 and received a U.S. passport in 1990.  He 
was a dual U.S./Israeli citizen.  He renewed his Israeli passport in September 2003 with an expiration date of September 2013.  Once he received his U.S. 
passport, he only used his Israeli passport to enter and exit Israel.  At Applicant's request, Israel revoked his citizenship on 15 August 2004, and he returned his 
Israeli passport to that government on 31 August 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's parents are citizen residents of Israel.  His father survived the holocaust and immigrated to Israel after World War II.  His mother was born and 
raised in what is now Israel.  Both are retired; they did not work for the government.  Applicant maintains contact with his parents by telephone on a weekly 
basis.  Between 1986 and the late 1990s, they visited Applicant in the U.S. annually.  The trips have ceased because Applicant's father is in poor health.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's sole sibling, a sister, and her husband are citizen residents of Israel.  They have three children.  Although they both served mandatory military 
service, neither works for the government.  Applicant speaks with his sister by telephone approximately once a month.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has several aunts and uncles to whom he speaks by telephone two or three times a year.  He also has three close friends from growing up in Israel 
with whom he maintains telephonic contact two to four times a year.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has visited Israel five times since he came to the U.S. in 1986--in 1996, twice in 2000, and once each in 2001 and 2004.  Applicant has no financial 
interests in Israel, but in the event of his parents' death, he believes he would probably share in their modest estate.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C--Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant exercised dual U.S./Israeli citizenship (&para; 1.a) and obtained an Israeli passport in 2003 despite having a U.S. passport (&para; 
1.b).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make 
decisions that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he exercised dual citizenship by obtaining and using an Israeli passport 
after he acquired a U.S. passport.  DC E2.A3.1.2.1; DC E2.A3.1.2.2.  As a dual citizen, Applicant had a right to hold a passport from both the U.S. and Israel.  
But a security clearance must "be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the 
appropriate agency of the United States Government."  Memo. from Arthur L. Money, Asst Sec. Def. Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, to 
Directors of Defense Agencies, <EM>Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative 
Guideline</EM> (Aug. 16, 2000).  Applicant took the appropriate steps and has renounced his Israeli citizenship and returned the Israeli passport.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC E2.A3.1.3.4.  
Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B--Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P>

of Israel; and Applicant traveled to Israel four times between 1996 and 2001 (&para; 2.e).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other 
persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create 
the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR-Applicant has immediate family members

are not agents of a foreign power and are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to his family members and loyalty to the U.S.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not an exact science.  Instead, they are predictive judgments about an applicant's security suitability in light of that person's 
past conduct and <EM>present circumstances</EM>.  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 528-29.  The evidence established that Applicant is a loyal U.S. citizen.  At the same time, the 
evidence clearly established Applicant has strong ties of affection or obligation to his family members and friends who are citizen residents of Israel.  Although 
these foreign associates are not agents of a foreign power, Applicant failed to demonstrate that his foreign associates are not <EM>in a position of vulnerability </EM>such 
that he could be forced to choose between loyalty to the U.S. and loyalty to them.  Under these circumstances, I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
