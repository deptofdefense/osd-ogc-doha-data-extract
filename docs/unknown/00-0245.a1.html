<P>Administrative Judge Jerome H. Silber issued a decision dated September 28, 2000, in which he concluded it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons 
set forth below the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992 as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: Whether the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious or contrary 
to law?</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant dated May 31, 2000.  The SOR 
was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  
Applicant requested a hearing which was held on August 22, 2000.  The Administrative Judge issued a decision on September 28, 
2000 in which he concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  Applicant appealed that unfavorable decision.<A HREF="00-0245.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Whether the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law?  On appeal, Applicant discusses various 
prior inconsistent statements as to his drug history and the role of others in preparing the written form of those statements.  The 
Board construes Applicant's appeal brief as arguing that the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious or contrary 
to law.  The Board does not agree.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant fails to demonstrate that the Administrative Judge's pertinent factual findings are unsustainable under Item E3.1.32.1 of 
the Directive's Additional Procedural Guidance in light of the record evidence.  Nor do Applicant's arguments demonstrate that the 
Administrative Judge's conclusions regarding Applicant's falsification conduct are arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.</P> 
 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified 
information.  <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Security requirements include consideration of a person's 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  <EM>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy</EM>, 284 F.2d 173, 183 
(D.C. Cir. 1960), <EM>aff'd</EM>, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  Falsification of a security questionnaire provides a rational basis for an adverse 
security clearance decision.  <EM>See Harrison v. McNamara</EM>, 228 F.Supp. 406, 408 (D. Conn. 1964)(lying on application for 
government position requiring a security clearance raises questions as to person's reliability and justifies dismissal), <EM>aff'd per 
curiam</EM>, 380 U.S. 261 (1965).</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's falsification of a security questionnaire provide a rational 
basis for the Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error by the Administrative Judge below.  Therefore the 
Administrative Judge's decision is affirmed.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> The Administrative Judge found for Applicant on Paragraph 1 of the SOR (Guideline F) and three subparagraphs of Paragraph 2 
(Guideline E).  None of those findings are raised on appeal and therefore none are addressed by the Board.
