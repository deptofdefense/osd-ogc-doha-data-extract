<P>In January 2000, Applicant, an American citizen by birth, married a Russian citizen with whom he still lives. Applicant's wife's parents (now divorced), 
grandmother, and a great aunt, still live in and are citizens of Russia. Applicant's wife maintains regular contact with her mother. Applicant has failed to 
mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B arising from his ties of affection or obligation to foreign citizens. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On September 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (SOR) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise 
security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on investigative information available to the government, 
DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security 
clearance.<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on December 22, 2004, and I convened a hearing in this 
matter on February 24, 2005. The parties appeared as scheduled and the government presented nine exhibits (GE 1 through 9), and the testimony of one witness. 
Of these exhibits, GE 3 through 8 were admitted for administrative notice, and after hearing comments and objections from Applicant, I agreed to consider 
them for informational purposes. Applicant presented two exhibits (AE A and B), which were admitted without objection. Applicant also presented his own 
testimony and that of two other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on March 8, 2005. Issuance of this decision was delayed due to an unusually large 
caseload.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>At the hearing, the government moved to amend the SOR by adding the following allegations under Guideline B:</P> 
<P>"g. Your spouse's grandmother and a great aunt are citizens of and currently reside in Russia.</P> 
<P>"h. Your spouse gave a gift of vodka and candy to a Russian government official to expedite processing of your spouse's exit paperwork."</P> 
<P>Over Applicant's objection, I granted the government's motion to add subparagraph 1.g, as stated above. However, for the reasons stated in the transcript at 
pages 139 - 142, and because it would be redundant to the allegation in SOR &para;1.e, I denied the motion to add subparagraph 1.h, as stated above.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 44 years old, was born and raised in the United States, and is currently employed by a defense contractor as a senior account manager. Applicant is 
a college graduate and is now married for the second time. His first marriage lasted from 1995 until a divorce in July 1997. In January 2000, he married a 
Russian woman he met through a matchmaking service specializing in matching American men and Russian women. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant found the matchmaking service on the internet, but his contacts with his wife were initially conducted by faxing letters. Applicant's wife was one of 
nine Russian women with whom Applicant began corresponding through the matchmaking service in late 1998 or early 1999. After deciding to correspond only 
with the woman he eventually married, Applicant also called her and sent her e-mails. These contacts led to a two-week visit to Russia in October 1999 to meet 
his intended bride and her family. At the end of that visit, Applicant proposed marriage and she accepted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant returned home, he applied for his fiancee's entry to the U.S. She arrived in December 1999, and the couple was married on January 14, 2000. 
Applicant's wife is now a permanent resident alien and is in the final stages of qualifying for U.S. citizenship. Neither Applicant or his wife have returned to 
Russia since 1999. His wife still has Russian citizenship and holds a valid Russian passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother- and father-in-law are Russian citizens who still live in that country. They are divorced and Applicant's wife has had no contact with her 
father, whose whereabouts are unknown, for several years. Applicant's wife calls her mother, who works as a cleaning woman since the end of her marriage, on 
average about once a week. After Applicant and his wife were married, Applicant's mother-in-law sent them $4,000 from her savings to use in getting started in 
their life together. Applicant's mother-in-law later sent them an additional $6,000 from savings. She had accumulated these funds by saving her husband's 
money during their marriage and from her own income thereafter.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife and her mother do not trust Russian government officials and feel they are generally corrupt. His mother-in-law keeps all her money either in 
her apartment or on her person as she does not trust Russian banks. Applicant's wife had to pay a small bribe to a Russian official to complete her emigration 
paperwork after she agreed to go to the U.S. to marry Applicant. Applicant's mother-in-law has insisted Applicant's wife not return to Russia in light of the 
crime and corruption there.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia and the United States have had a closer, less adversarial relationship. However, the interests of the two nations are 
still often times at odds with each other. Russia still aims much of its intelligence resources at the United States and actively operates in all major aspects of 
intelligence collection and exploitation. The Russian government can now be characterized as more democratic than the Soviet regime; however, the executive 
branch generally wields considerable power unchecked by either the legislative or judicial branches, the latter often being subject to undue political influences. 
It is not surprising, then, that Russia's human rights record has not improved in the past 15 years. As a result of rampant organized crime, lack of law 
enforcement, and government corruption, average citizens in Russia are often subjected to crimes of extortion and outright theft by both criminals and 
government officials alike.<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife's grandmother and great aunt also live in and are citizens of Russia. His wife's contact with them is limited to once or twice yearly holiday 
greetings. Applicant has had no contact with them, and only has limited contact with his mother-in-law. His wife also has occasional contact with a friend from 
her school days in Russia. He helped with Applicant's transportation to and from the airport when Applicant visited Russia.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Security clearance 
decisions must reflect consideration of both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and circumstances of 
each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines 
should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified 
information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guideline to be applied here is Guideline B (foreign 
influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for the Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the 
government meets its burden, it establishes that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. 
The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the 
Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based 
on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution 
of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Under Guideline B, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Available information supports the 
SOR allegations that Applicant lives with his wife, who is a foreign citizen (SOR &para; 1.a), that her parents and two other relatives are also citizens of Russia and 
still live there (SOR &para;&para; 1.b and 1.g), and that Applicant's wife has frequent contact with her mother (SOR &para; 1.c). Available information also supports the 
allegation that Applicant traveled to Russia in October 1999 (SOR &para; 1.d), that Applicant's wife bribed a Russian government official (SOR &para; 1.e), and that 
Applicant's mother-in-law sent him and his wife a total of $10,000 as gifts to help them start their lives together (SOR &para; 1.f).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g, as supported by the government's information, raise security concerns specifically addressed under Guideline B. SOR &para; 1.d, also 
established by the government's information, shows only that Applicant traveled to a foreign country, which is not by itself disqualifying. Nor in this case is it 
probative of whether he is directly, or through his ties to his wife, susceptible of foreign influence. SOR &para;&para; 1.e and 1.f, as established by the government's 
information, also fail to plead any Guideline B disqualifying condition;<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> however, I have considered these facts as part of the record as a whole in determining 
whether Applicant's ties of affection should be disqualifying.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the foregoing, Guideline B disqualifying condition (DC) 1<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that, as a matter of common sense and human 
experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection to the immediate family members of the person's spouse. These circumstances 
raise security concerns just as if the facts concerned Applicant's own immediate family members.<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> The information and testimony presented here does nothing 
to rebut that presumption. Applicant's wife is close to her mother as evidenced by their frequent contact and by the fact her mother gave up her life's savings for 
her daughter and new husband.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Further, an overarching consideration here is that Russia has a poor human rights record, little effective law enforcement, rampant organized crime and 
government corruption, and maintains an aggressive intelligence stance toward the U.S. These circumstances raise reasonable concerns about the possibility a 
Russian citizen with ties to an American holding a security clearance would be targeted for coercion in furtherance of hostile intelligence gathering efforts 
against the U.S. The fact Applicant's wife had to bribe a government official when she was trying to leave Russia, and her testimony about the corrupt nature of 
Russian government officials, further support these considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Of the listed mitigating conditions (MC), MC1<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> fails because, although  Applicant's wife's family are not agents of a foreign power, Applicant has not shown 
they are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. To the contrary, based on the foregoing discussion of the applicability of DC 1, it is reasonable to 
conclude Applicant's wife's family are in such a position. MC 2,<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> MC 4,<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC5<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> are factually inapposite to this case, and MC 3<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies only to the 
allegation in SOR &para; 1.g as there has been little contact with Applicant's grandmother or great aunt, and the contact was casual at best. However, Applicant's 
wife still maintains regular contact with her mother.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions listed under Guideline B. No single fact or 
adjudicative factor is dispositive of the security concerns raised in this case; however, a fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-23434.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> of the entire record before me 
reflects an unacceptable security risk raised by Applicant's ties of affection to foreign citizens residing abroad.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
