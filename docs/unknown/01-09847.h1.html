<P>Twenty-nine year old Applicant's history of not meeting her financial obligations, accompanied by <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberate refusal to attend to them purportedly because of a 
dispute with her third ex-husband, and a tepid recent effort to address them after repeatedly declaring she would resolve them, only after the security clearance

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 20, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20,1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated October 2, 2002, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have her case decided on the 
written record, in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on October 18, 2002.  A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM)<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation.  Any such submissions were due by January 11, 2003,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and she chose not to do so.  The case was assigned to, and received by, this Administrative 
Judge on March 6, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has denied all of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.), as well as the one 
allegation pertaining to personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 29-year old employee of a defense contractor, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been disclosed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been financially overextended since the mid-1990s, and as a consequence, since then, has demonstrated a history of not meeting her financial 
obligations.  She attributed her predicament to various causes, most notably her anger, frustration, and dissatisfaction over her third ex-husband's failure or 
refusal to abide by an agreement they purportedly had to assume one half of the debts previously generated.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  She also deliberately ignored another debt 
because she felt the creditor had implied she was a liar.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  And, most of the other debts became delinquent when she neglected them due to the turmoil 
associated with her divorces.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Report of Credit,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> dated November 24, 1999, listed 18 accounts, <A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> of which one reflected a repossession, two reflected "slow pay," and five 
reflected "bad debt."  Of those, five have been identified in the SOR, and they total approximately $4,328.00 past-due.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1994, Applicant and her eventual third ex-husband purchased an automobile for $16,900.00 and financed the transaction through a bank (further 
identified in subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR) with an installment loan requiring monthly payments of $351.00.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  In about August 1995, after missing one 
monthly payment of principal (she claimed to have paid the interest portion) Applicant initiated a voluntary surrender and repossession of the vehicle.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  After 
the vehicle was sold by the creditor, there was a deficiency balance of $3,000.00.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As with the deficiency debt discussed above, Applicant contends she and her third ex-husband also had an oral agreement for this debt under which each would 
be responsible for one-half of the deficiency upon their divorce, but the property settlement portion of the Decree is silent as to that particular account.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  When 
he failed to make any required payments, Applicant was angry and frustrated, and because she felt she would eventually also have to pay the entire amount 
herself, she refused to make any payments.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  In September 2000, Applicant acknowledged she was wrong to completely ignore the debt, and vowed to satisfy 
the debt in full "as soon as possible."<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  With the exception of one undated letter to the creditor seeking to establish a payment plan,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> the record is silent as to 
other possible efforts which may have been taken by Applicant to either actually make payments or enter into payment arrangements with the creditor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1994, Applicant opened an individual revolving charge account with a clothing store (further identified in subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR) and received 
items of value totaling approximately $200.00.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  The account eventually was "charged off" as a bad debt.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The property settlement portion of the Decree 
clearly states Applicant would be responsible for the outstanding balance with the creditor.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  In September 2000, Applicant indicated she thought she had 
already paid the account off when it was closed, but vowed to satisfy the debt in full "as soon as possible."<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  With the exception of one undated letter to the 
creditor seeking to establish a payment plan,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> the record is silent as to other possible efforts which may have been taken by Applicant to either actually make 
payments or enter into payment arrangements with the creditor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1995, Applicant opened an individual account with a telephone service (further identified in subparagraph 1.c. of the SOR) and received items or 
service of value totaling approximately $486.00.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  The account was eventually sent to collection as a bad debt, in the amount of $351.00.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant contends she and her third ex-husband had an oral agreement under which each would be responsible for one-half of the debt upon their divorce, but 
the property settlement portion of the Decree is again silent as to that particular account.  When he failed to make any required payments, Applicant became 
angry and frustrated, and because she felt she would eventually have to pay the entire amount herself, she refused to make any payments.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  In September 2000, 
Applicant acknowledged she was wrong to completely ignore the debt, and vowed to satisfy the debt in full "as soon as possible."<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  With the exception of one 
undated letter to the creditor seeking to establish a payment plan,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> the record is silent as to other possible efforts which may have been taken by Applicant to 
either actually make payments or enter into payment arrangements with the creditor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1999, Applicant opened an individual account with a retail outlet (further identified in subparagraph 1.d. of the SOR) and received fuel of a value 
totaling approximately $294.00.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Applicant contends she paid the bill with a check which, according to her, had been properly processed,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> but which, 
according to the creditor, was returned for insufficient funds.  The account was eventually sent to collection as a bad debt.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  In September 2000, Applicant 
stated she had tried to explain the circumstances of the disputed debt but became involved in a "verbal/telephonic argument" with the creditor.  When she 
perceived she was being called a liar, she refused to follow-up with the issue and deliberately ignored the disputed indebtedness thereafter.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  She vowed to 
satisfy the debt in full if she is unable to prove that it has already been paid.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  No such proof has been offered, and the record is silent as to possible efforts 
which may have been taken by Applicant to either actually make payments or enter into payment arrangements with the creditor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1994, Applicant opened an individual revolving charge account with a clothing store (further identified in subparagraph 1.e. of the SOR) and 
received items of value totaling approximately $612.00.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  The account eventually was "charged off" as a bad debt.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  The property settlement portion of the 
Decree clearly states Applicant would be responsible for the outstanding balance with the creditor.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  In September 2000, Applicant attributed the delinquency 
to her "divorce-related constraints," without further elaboration, and vowed to satisfy the debt in full "as soon as possible."<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  With the exception of one 
undated letter to the creditor seeking to establish a payment plan,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> the record is silent as to other possible efforts which may have been taken by Applicant to 
either actually make payments or enter into payment arrangements with the creditor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 12, 1999, Applicant completed SF 86,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> and in response to an inquiry pertaining to possible financial delinquencies (<EM>In the last 7 years, have you been 
over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?</EM>), Applicant responded "no."<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  She certified her response was true, complete, and accurate.  It was false.  She had 
omitted and concealed the truth regarding a number of outstanding financial obligations which fell within that category, as described above.  In fact, Applicant 
also lied about not having financial delinquencies currently over 90 days delinquent<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> as well as not having property repossessed in the last seven years,<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> but 
neither of those falsifications was alleged in the SOR.  Applicant subsequently denied intending to deceive, and simply stated that she had ignored the debts so 
long that she continued to ignore them when completing her SF 86.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  She eventually modified her position by denying the cited accounts were debts when she 
completed the SF 86.<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed as a truck driver by the same company since May 1999, and before that, when not experiencing varying periods of unemployment, 
worked as a cashier for several different employers.  The quality of her performance has not been revealed.</SPAN></P>

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>[Guideline F - Financial Considerations]: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>(E2.A6.1.2.1.)  history of not meeting financial obligations;</P> 
<P>(E2.A6.1.2.3.)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>(E2.A6.1.3.3.)  the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</P> 
<P><STRONG>[Personal Conduct - Guideline E]: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>(E2.A5.1.2.2.)  the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P> 
<P>None apply.</P> 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="01-09847.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw 
only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences 
that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the Government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established its case.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial difficulties, attributed, in part, to her marital discord, were 
exacerbated by her deliberate refusal to attend to her finances.  After she fell behind in her monthly payments, she stopped making payments altogether.  As a 
result, various creditors either charged off their losses, transferred or sold the accounts, repossessed her motor vehicle, or referred the overdue accounts to 
collection.  And, she issued a bad check to one creditor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's initial motivation to ignore her debts was driven by her anger and frustration with her third ex-husband as well as her refusal to accept one 
creditor's explanation for failing to adjust her account following receipt of a bad check.  Fiscal responsibility or moral obligation were not even remote 
considerations.  In September 2000, upon being interviewed by an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS), she declared her intention to resolve all her 
outstanding financial obligations.  Yet, as of November 2001, when she responded to the DOHA-generated interrogatories, and as of October 2002, when she 
responded to the SOR, her inaction remained undisturbed.  And, in January 2003, when afforded the opportunity to prove her debts had been resolved, she 
chose to pass on doing so.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Despite being aware of her debts, as well as there being official interest in them, she apparently took no action to resolve any of them until she received the 
DOHA-generated interrogatories, and at that point simply wrote several of those creditors.  Applicant's efforts have been superficial at best, and, in reality, 
seem to be nothing more than promises made and broken.  It was only after the security clearance review process commenced that she was finally motivated to 
take </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>some</EM> action with regard to some of her debts.  In the absence of confirmed payment arrangements, or actual payments diminishing the outstanding 
financial obligations, Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) 
E2.A6.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's marital discord and divorce-some of the conditions attributed by her to be the initial causes of her financial problems-fall within Financial 
Considerations Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>)).  However, the significance of that MC is minimized, as 
to some of the debts, because those debts were directed to her responsibility in the property settlement portion of the Decree.  Marital discord was not the real 
culprit in this instance.  Applicant's anger and frustration, as well as insulted feelings, played a much larger degree of importance.  Furthermore, it was her 
candid observation that she had simply ignored the debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's actions with regard to those outstanding debts, her refusal to honor those financial commitments despite voluntarily entering into them, all support 
the conclusion a financial problem continues to exist.  Moreover, her continuing problem is not primarily the result of a condition beyond her control.  Under 
these circumstances, I believe Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case, for the evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts 
as to Applicant's continued security eligibility and suitability with respect to her financial considerations.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.e. of the SOR 
are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline E, the Government has established its case.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Examination of Applicant's actions related to her financial delinquencies of over 180 
days reveals conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability.  There is some dispute surrounding Applicant's lack of candor for 
she has denied the essential elements of the allegation.  But, it is inescapable that financial obligations which were considered bad debts and which were either 
charged off or sent to collection during the period 1994-95 would be at least 180 days delinquent as of June 1999 when she completed her SF 86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Instead, Applicant seemingly argues that since the Report of Credit in evidence was only made in November 1999, the accounts could not be considered "debts" 
when she completed the SF 86.  That argument lacks merit.  Notwithstanding her certification, oath, and affirmation that her responses and statements were true 
and accurate, Applicant willfully falsified, omitted, or concealed material facts pertaining to her history of financial delinquencies of 180 days.  Her lack of 
candor--dishonesty, falsification, omission, and deception--commenced with her false answer on the SF 86 in June 1999, and continued through her less than 
totally candid response during her interview with an investigator of DSS in September 2000. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> And, it continued in October 2002.  In fact, it continues to this day 
because Applicant has never conceded the truth, insisting the debts were not "debts" as of the date she completed the SF 86.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's questionable personal 
conduct in this regard clearly falls within Personal Conduct DC E2.A5.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate, meaningful security clearance 
determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security.  The nature of 
Applicant's actions and activities therefore pose a serious potential risk to the nation's security precautions which go to the very heart of the nation's security 
system.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An applicant's responsibilities associated with the granting of a security clearance are considerable in terms of protecting the national security and in 
maintaining appropriate personal conduct.  Along with the responsibilities is accountability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this instance, Applicant is now accountable for those past 
actions and activities.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I believe Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the Government's case, for the evidence leaves me with grave questions and 
doubts as to Applicant's continued security eligibility and suitability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, allegation 2.a. of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
