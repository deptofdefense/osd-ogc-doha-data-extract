<P>Applicant has mitigated security concerns over his past criminal conduct, drug use, and personal conduct.  Given his record of excellence at work and in the 
community, he has mitigated his  past drug use in 1997 and his criminal conduct as he has not had any adverse incidents for five years.  Thus, he has 
demonstrated his intent not to abuse any drugs in the future and he has demonstrated clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  The omissions on his security 
form were not intentional as he disclosed substantial other adverse information in response to other questions. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on June 20, 2003.  The SOR detailed reasons why 
the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.<A HREF="02-14495.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over drug use (Guideline H), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and personal conduct (Guideline E). Applicant 
responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on July 7, 2003, where he admitted all of the allegations and requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on September 11, 2003, attested it was ready to proceed.  The case was assigned to me on September 12, 
2003.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to; a Notice of Hearing issued<A HREF="02-14495.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> on September 23, 2003, set the matter for October 7, 
2003, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  </P> 
 
<P>At the hearing the Government offered  nine Government exhibits which were admitted into evidence. (Exhibits 1-9)  The Applicant represented himself and 
offered nine exhibits which were admitted into evidence.  (Exhibits A-I)  Applicant testified and called two witnesses.  The  transcript (TR) was received on 
October 15, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 38 years old, has worked for a defense contractor (Company #1) in State #1 since May 2000. As Applicant needs a security clearance to perform his 
job, he completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in June 2000.  Applicant served in the U.S. military from 1984 to 1988 in the National Guard until 
he was medically discharged; and he served again from 1995 to 1998 in the National Guard.   From November 1996 to January 1998 he worked for Company 
#2 in State #1.  Applicant attended a state university in State #1 from 1985 to 1990 and received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his fiancee had a daughter in September 1995.  Applicant was upset when the mother took the child and left him to live with another man.  For 
much of the time he had no telephone number and no way to reach his daughter.  When the child's mother sought public assistance, State #1 contacted him to 
pay child support.  As he was also seeking visitation of his daughter, the court suggested he take a DNA test which he agreed to do.  While waiting for the 
results of the tests, the child's mother was killed in an automobile accident.  He then retained counsel to gain custody of his daughter.  After he was granted 
custody of his daughter in July 2000, he was required to pay $300 for the DNA test and $900 for the public assistance that the child's mother had received 
before her death.  He has repaid State #1 for these expenses. </P> 
 
<P>Before Applicant got custody of his daughter, he went to State #2 in the fall of 1997 and used marijuana while on vacation.  After he returned to work, he failed 
a urinalysis drug test in 1997.  At the time he held a security clearance with the National Guard.  In January 1998 Applicant left his job with Company #2 by 
mutual agreement as he was selected for a reduction in force; the fact that he had tested positive for marijuana in1997 after a random drug test may have been a 
contributing factor. (SOR 1.a. through 1.c.)  Applicant has not used marijuana since 1997.  He has subsequently passed a drug test for employment qualification 
with Defense Contractor #1.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admits a series of arrests: an alcohol-related arrest from December 1991; a November 1992 arrest for writing bad checks; a February 1994 arrest and 
finding of guilty to driving while his license was revoked and violation of probation; a February 1996 arrest and guilty plea for assault, a March 1996 arrest and 
guilty finding for Driving while under the Influence (DUI) and Driving While License Revoked; and a December 1997 charge and finding of guilty for Driving 
with a Revoked Drivers License on a military facility in State #1.  (SOR 2.a. through 2.g.)  However, after the 1997 arrest when he spent 60 days in jail, he 
attended alcohol classes, and Alcoholics Anonymous and began to change his life style.  Further life style changes were motivated after he was granted custody 
of his daughter in July 2000.</P> 
 
<P>For the past five years, Applicant's State #1 record has shown no adverse incidents.  He no longer drinks excessively.  He has also worked diligently to re-establish his credit rating.  He has recently purchased a home.  He now comes home after work to be with his daughter and is involved with her school.  He 
supports the school and her activities in the community.</P> 
 
<P>The principal at his daughter's school has known Applicant for three years and wrote a letter endorsing Applicant's contributions to the school and community.  
He concluded Applicant is "an asset" to the school and community.  </P> 
 
<P>When Applicant completed his security form (SF 86), through an oversight and misunderstanding he failed to list all of his arrests; while he omitted arrests in 
1994 and 1997 as he did not think they fell within the perimeters of the question, he disclosed all his other arrests.  Further while he failed to disclose in answer 
to Question 40 on Public Record Civil Court Actions that he had been involved in a paternity/child support action in November 1999 in State #1 in a domestic 
relations court, he explained he did not understand that court action was a civil action he needed to disclose as he did not understand that an action in domestic 
relations court was a civil action.  (SOR 3.a. and 3.b.)  I found him credible that he had no intent to falsify by these omissions as he disclosed substantial 
adverse information in response to other questions on the security form.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Job Performance</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was given a commendation, a spot bonus award of $500 and a pay raise of 3% in January 2003 because of the high quality of the technical support he 
provided in a military exercise.  His performance was commended by the Government.</P> 
 
<P>In November 2000 Applicant received a letter of commendation from a project manager for the U.S. Army for his contributions to the success of an important 
project.  </P> 
 
<P>His July 2003 evaluation described Applicant's contributions as "vital"; his expertise and contributions made the Government customer very satisfied.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's supervisor testified on his behalf as he has know Applicant for three years and supervised him for one year where he has had daily contact.  The 
supervisor has given Applicant good evaluations.  He reported that Applicant has an outstanding reputation within the company.  This supervisor recommended 
that Applicant be granted a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>The Deputy Director of a U.S. Army program testified on behalf of Applicant as he is the contracting officer for the work that Applicant performs.  He praised 
Applicant's past contributions to an important project and recommended him for a security clearance so he can work on future  projects.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[First]  Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[Second] Inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Any drug abuse (see above definition); </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><STRONG>Guideline  J</STRONG> <STRONG>- Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.   The criminal behavior was not recent</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>d.   [T]he factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur; </P> 
 
<P>f.  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant mitigated the Government's security concerns over his isolated marijuana use in 1997 which led him to fail a drug test after he used drugs at a time 
he was on leave but during a period when he had been granted access to classified information.  While his using marijuana while he had a security clearance is a 
serious concern, he has reformed his lifestyle and subsequently passed a drug test to gain employment with Company #1 in May 2000.  Applicant  made a 
convincing commitment to avoid all future drug use and has not use any marijuana in over six years.  He gained custody of his daughter in 2000 and fully 
reformed his lifestyle as demonstrated by his record of excellence at work and in the community.  Thus, he has mitigated his  past drug use <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">under Mitigating 
Condition (MC) 1, as the drug involvement was not recent and under MC 3, as he has demonstrated his intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</SPAN>. After 
considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. incorporated under SOR 
Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has similarly mitigated the Government's security concerns over his criminal conduct from 1991 to 1997 when he had arrests and convictions related 
to his alcohol abuse, assault, and financial problems.  To his credit, Applicant now has reformed his conduct.  He has a very successful work record and 
favorable community references which indicate his successful change in his lifestyle. </P> 
 
<P>Consequently, the actions that led to his convictions may now be mitigated under MC a, as the criminal behavior was not recent, under MC d., as the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur, and under MC f., as there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Hence, after considering the Appendix I 
Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a. through 2. h. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 2. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>While the Government raised security concerns over Applicant's personal conduct in failing to disclose fully all adverse information in answering questions 26 
and 40, I am persuaded that he had no intent to falsify as he disclosed substantial other adverse information on his security form.  For example, he disclosed his 
drug use and the adverse consequences as well as several other arrests  Thus no disqualifying conditions apply.  Even were one to conclude these omissions 
were deliberate, they would be mitigated under MC 2. As the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided 
correct information voluntarily.  </P> 
 
<P>In addition to his omissions not being intentional, I also conclude Applicant's consistently good work record and favorable reference letters establish that he is 
generally viewed as an honest and trustworthy person.  Hence, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for 
Applicant on subparagraph 3.a.. and 3.b. under SOR Paragraph 3</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>

<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
