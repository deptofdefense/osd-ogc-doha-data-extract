<P>Applicant was arrested and convicted of offenses resulting from his excessive consumption of alcohol.  Because he failed to perform the sentence to community 
service for assaulting a police officer, Applicant was sentenced to jail for one year and 15 days.  Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance 
application by failing to note that he was fired from a job, had been convicted of criminal offenses related to his use of alcohol, and had been treated for his 
alcohol abuse.  Applicant failed to sufficiently mitigate the criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 12 February 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) under the applicable Executive Order<A HREF="02-00500.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive<A HREF="02-00500.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-failure to meet 
the criminal conduct (Guideline J) and personal conduct (Guideline E) personnel security guidelines of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing 
on 7 Mach 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 21 July 2003.  On 12 August 2003, I convened a 
hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's security clearance.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the 
proceeding on 20 August 2003.</P>
