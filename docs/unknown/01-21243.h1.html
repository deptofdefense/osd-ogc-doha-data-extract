<P>The Applicant has past due indebtedness to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in excess of $53,000.  The Applicant disputes this tax debt, and filed bankruptcy 
petitions in 1998 and again in 2000 to prevent Federal Income Tax levies.  Because of the Applicant's current annual income of about $37,000, "the IRS has 
chosen not to pursue any collection activity.  Penalty and interest continue to accrue," however.  The Applicant's current financial situation is of current security 
significance; and as such, clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 12, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on April 14, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on May 5, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 20, 2003, and the case was heard on June 11, 2003.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence and called one witness to testify.  Testimony was also taken from the Applicant.  The transcript was received on 
June 26, 2003.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's current financial difficulties militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The 
Applicant admits the three bankruptcy filings, 1.a.~1.c., but denies the three alleged debts, 1.d.~1.f.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">63 years of age, is retired 
from practicing law for 35 years, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.e.  While the Applicant practiced law, he also had a computer business (Transcript (TR) at page 34 line 1 to page 37 line 23).  He ceased lawyering; and 
when he filed his Federal Income Tax return for tax year 1994, the IRS disallowed the business deductions he claimed on his personal income tax return (TR at 
page 19 line 21 to page 21 line 14, at page 27 line 15 to page 28 line 13, at page 34 line 1 to page 37 line 23, at page 40 lines 12~21, and page 43 line 24 to page 
44 line 25).  The Applicant disputes the IRS claim, but the IRS does not agree with his position (<EM>id</EM>).  The State followed up on the IRS claim, and collected 
$6,630 from the Applicant by levying his wages (TR at page 28 line 22 to page 30 line 4, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) B at page 2).  He currently owes 
nothing to the State (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998 and again in 2000 in an effort to stop potential Federal Income Tax levies (TR 
at page 30 line 20 to page 32 line 13, at page 33 lines 15~21, at page 37 line 24 to page 38 line 25, and Government Exhibits (GX) 3~5).  As of June 16, 2003, 
the IRS's position is the following:</P> 
 
<P>With penalty and interest, computed through June 30, 2003, the current balance due on tax year 1994 is $53,365.10.  At present time the IRS has elected not to 
pursue any collection activity.  <STRONG>Penalty and interest continue to accrue on this debt and will continue to do so until paid in full</STRONG> (AppX C at page 2, 
emphasis supplied).</P> 
 
<P>1.f.  The Applicant credibly disputes a $115 debt to an alleged creditor, that, despite his best effort, he has been unable to contact (TR at page 25 line 1 to page 
27 line 14, and AppX C at page 3).  He and his spouse have absolutely no recollection of this alleged past due debt (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant submits "Points and Authorities In Opposition" to the Government's position disputing the three alleged debts (AppX A).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant owes in excess of $53,000 in past due indebtedness to the IRS.  He disputes this debt which was incurred in 1995; and as the Applicant earns 
only about $37,000 each year, the IRS has "elected not to pursue any collection activity" at present.  However, as the Applicant is financially unwilling or 
unable to do anything to address this financial responsibility, disqualifying conditions 1 and 3 are applicable in this case, as the Applicant has a "history of" and 
an "inability" to satisfy this significant past due debt.  His current financial difficulties are clearly of concern to the Government; and as such, are of present 
security significance.  Guideline F is therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his financial difficulties.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
