<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given his service in the U.S. Army, his stronger ties of affection and obligation to his family in the U.S., and his actions in support of the war against terrorism, 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his family ties to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Republic </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of Yemen under Guideline B. He also mitigated security concerns under

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 14, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security 
concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the 
government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to 
classified information.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber3"></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR on July 27, 2005, and requested a hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on October 17, 2005. On November 3, 2005, I convened a 
hearing at which the government presented 11 exhibits, marked GE 1-11, to support the SOR.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant testified on his own behalf, and presented the 
testimony of one witness and 22 exhibits that were admitted and marked AE A-V. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 1, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>PROCEDURAL MATTER</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the government's motion, and with Applicant's consent, the SOR was amended by deleting the words and number " under Article 15 of" from the 
second line of subparagraph 2.a.(1). The amendment was granted to conform the SOR to the evidence submitted.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's notice of hearing was issued on October 19, 2005, and the hearing was scheduled for November 3, 2005, with Applicant's consent. At the hearing, 
Applicant knowingly and willingly waived the 15-day notice, and affirmatively stated he had sufficient time to prepare for the hearing and was ready to 
proceed.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with explanations, SOR allegations 1.a - 1.d. He admitted the underlying facts alleged in subparagraph 2.a.(1), 
but claimed his failure to disclose the information on his 2003 security clearance application (SF 86) was a mistake, and that he did not intent to falsify the 
document or mislead the government. I considered SOR allegations 2.a.(1) denied. Applicant's </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant's testimony, and the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 54-year-old married man. In April 2003, he was hired as a linguist/translator by a company doing business with the Department of Defense 
(DOD) and requires access to classified information to perform his duties. Since he was hired, Applicant has been working with U.S. military forces in Iraq, 
translating captured documents for intelligence exploitation purposes. He also conducted negotiations with Iraqi nationals on behalf of U.S. personnel and 
recruited and trained personnel for the new Iraqi Army. Applicant worked directly with U.S. military personnel, and his superb work ethic and technical 
proficiency earned him the respect and gratitude of his supervisors and DOD customers.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's nine character references described him as a person with the highest integrity, honesty, and loyalty. He was complimented for his selfless 
dedication, for going beyond the call of duty to accomplish the mission, and for his devoted service in the war against terrorism. As a result of his outstanding 
performance and attention to detail, Applicant was assigned to train other linguists and to perform recruiting duties among the Iraqi population. His 
performance exceeded the expectation of all his customers, and all of his character references stated they would welcome the opportunity to work with him 
again.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant held an interim access to classified information from 2003 to 2005. There is no evidence that Applicant has mishandled or risked the 
compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the Republic of Yemen. He received the equivalent of a high school diploma and attended two years at a vocational school. In 1972, at 
age 20, he was selected by the then-Socialist South Yemen government to attend a teacher's education program in Libya under a scholarship offered by Libya. 
After graduation, Applicant defected to the U.S. When Applicant finished his education in Libya, he followed his father to the U.S. He believed he had no 
future in Yemen because he did not belong to the Socialist Party or the Youth Party.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1974, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army. He testified he joined the Army because it was his opportunity to serve the country that gave him shelter. In 1976, 
while serving in Germany, Applicant was convicted at a general court-martial for aggravated assault and possession of a prohibited weapon.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He served 77 days 
in jail, and was returned to duty. In 1977, Applicant was honorably discharged. He attained the rank of specialist (E-4) before his discharge. While in the 
service, Applicant obtained resident alien status.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1980 to 1995, Applicant worked for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Yemen. He rented an apartment while living in Yemen and sold all 
his possessions when he left to return to the U.S. Applicant explained that although he was working in Yemen, his intent was always to return to his home in 
the U.S. To continue his naturalization application process, he and his wife returned to the U.S. at least once every year. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen in 1990. After returning to the U.S., Applicant worked one year as a carpenter. From 1997 to 2002, he worked as the operations manager for a company 
that retails office equipment. In 2002, he was wrongfully terminated from his job and was unemployed for approximately one year until he was hired by his 
current employer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents were born in Yemen. His father has been a resident of the U.S. since 1970. Before coming to the U.S., his father worked for an oil company 
in Saudi Arabia for approximately 20 years. He came to the U.S. to escape from the then-Socialist Yemeni government after it confiscated his property. 
Applicant testified his contact with his father was limited to occasional phone calls, usually during the Muslim holidays. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His mother is a citizen and resident of Yemen. She is 69 years old, lives in a mountain village, and farms the land. She has always been a homemaker and never 
worked for the Yemeni government. Applicant has two siblings that are citizens and residents of Yemen. His 39-year-old brother is an electrician by trade, who 
owns his own company, and has never worked for the Yemeni government. He visited Applicant in the U.S. around 1999 when Applicant's mother was staying 
with him. Applicant's sister is 38 years old, divorced, and works as a translator for a group of doctors. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he has little contact with his brother. He usually talks to his sister on Muslim holidays. Because Applicant's mother lives in the mountains, 
he only has contact with his mother approximately three times a year when she comes to the city to visit his sister. On those occasions, his sister calls him, and 
he talks to all his relatives at his sister's home. Applicant provided financial assistance to his mother on an "as needed" basis. Applicant testified he has no 
contact with the rest of his extended family or friends in Yemen. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had two other brothers that are now deceased. One of them was a resident alien in the U.S., serving in the Army Reserve. He was killed in a traffic 
accident in 1978. The other brother was killed in Yemen. Applicant does not know what happened to him, but speculated he was involved in some type of 
political struggle and was killed by Yemeni government forces. According to the Applicant, none of his siblings or family members ever worked for the 
Yemeni government, terrorist organizations, or for any organization inimical to the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Yemen in 1999 to visit his mother, siblings, and other relatives. A flood damaged his mother's home and he went back for approximately 
30 days to help her with the repairs. Applicant then brought his mother to the U.S. to live with him in  for a short period of time. He testified he tried to 
convince her to move in with him permanently, but she refused.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married his current wife in 1982. She was born in Bosnia-Herzegovina and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1995. Applicant's parents-in-law, as well as the rest of his wife's family, are citizens and residents of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Applicant and his wife have two children, a 23-year-old son 
(S), and a 21-year-old daughter (D) that were born in Austria and are now naturalized American citizens. Both were educated in the U.S., and are attending 
college. "S" completed two years of college in the U.S. and is now participating in a one year student exchange program at a French university. "D" has a full 
scholarship to a prestigious English university, but she is taking time off from college to work. As of the day of the hearing, she was working as a 
translator/linguist for the same company her father works for. She has been granted access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"D" testified at her father's hearing. She appears to be a very bright, poised, and articulate "all American girl" who is anxious to tackle the world. She feels she 
was not able to grow up close to her father because he was always busy working. "D" recognized, however, the sacrifices her father has made to be a good 
provider, and the sacrifices he is now making in the war against terrorism. She seemed proud of her father's accomplishments and his work with U.S. forces 
fighting terrorism. She and her father submitted their SF 86s at the same time. "D" testified she remembered quite clearly his instructions to "put down 
everything they asked for because they were Americans and had nothing to hide." She confirmed her father has contact with his Yemeni relatives approximately 
three times a year. She and her brother have no contact with their Yemeni relatives, except through her father.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant credibly testified he has no intentions of returning to Yemen to live. He was adamant about the fact the he and his family (wife and children) are 
Americans, and that the U.S. is their home. As evidence of his intent he pointed out that he owns two houses in the U.S. and his bank accounts and other 
investments are in the U.S. He testified he owns no property, bank accounts, or any interest or investments in Yemen. When asked about his relatives in Yemen, 
Applicant responded that they have their own families to take care of, and he has his family in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Republic of Yemen was established in 1990. It is a developing country with an active bicameral legislature. It is considered an important partner of the U.S. 
in the war against terrorism and has cooperated with U.S. law enforcement agencies taking action against al-Qaida operatives and other extremists. 
Notwithstanding, terrorist organizations such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (HAMAS) and the Palestine Islamic Jihad have offices in Yemen and are 
recognized as legal organizations by the Yemeni government.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Yemen recently released detainees with ties to al-Qaida and other extremist groups without 
consulting with the U.S., claiming the detaines had renounced violence. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Yemen's human rights record is considered poor. Government agencies engage in 
serious human rights violations including arbitrary arrests, detentions without charges, and torture. It also interferes with its people's privacy rights, arbitrarily 
searching homes, reading correspondence, and monitoring conversations.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his April 2003 SF 86, Applicant answered "No" to question 23, which asked whether he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offenses. He 
failed to disclose that in 1976 he was convicted at a court-martial of aggravated assault and possession of a prohibited weapon (felonies).<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant credibly 
testified he did not disclose his 1976 conviction because he was told to go back only seven years when answering the SF 86. He reviewed and resubmitted his 
SF 86 at least three times after follow-up interviews with government investigators. The last time he reviewed the SF 86, he was asked to report information 
within the last 10 years, and he complied with that request. At the hearing, Applicant recognized that he made the mistake of disregarding the instructions for 
question 23, and instead followed the instructions of his employer. He claimed, however, he had no intention to mislead or falsify his answers. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he had nothing to hide, because even though he was convicted, he returned to his unit after serving his sentence and honorably served the 
remainder of his service obligation. He further indicated that the information concerning his court-martial conviction was reflected on his DD 214,<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and he 
provided a copy of it when he submitted his SF 86. He also argued he knew the government would have easy access to all the information in his military 
records. In light of Applicant's demeanor, testimony, and available evidence, I find Applicant's omission was not deliberate or made with the intent to mislead.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. The 
administrative judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of the case. The guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition 
is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors 
listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's 
eligibility for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government 
based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and 
trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish, by substantial 
evidence,<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> a prima facie case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified information. The 
responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></A>clearance, the applicant 
carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an 
applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> security concern exists when an individual's immediate family and other persons to whom he may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries are also relevant if they make an individual potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, common sense suggests that the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a 
person is to being manipulated if the relative or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In every security clearance case an applicant's ties or connections to any foreign country require careful examination.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding, the mere possession of 
family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying. The language of the foreign influence guideline does not require a 
conclusion that an unacceptable security concern exists based solely on an applicant's family ties in a foreign country.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An administrative judge must consider 
the record evidence as a whole in deciding if the facts and circumstances of an applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable security concern or risk.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a prima facie case under Guideline B by showing that Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has close ties of affection or obligation with his mother and 
siblings, who are citizens and residents of Yemen.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> The strength of his relationship is demonstrated, to a certain extent, by his contacts with his family, the 
financial support provided, and his trips to Yemen. The fact that Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation to persons who are either citizens or residents 
of Yemen is sufficient to raise security concerns concerning the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign 
country.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: <EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or 
obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In deciding whether Applicant's family members are in a position to be exploited, I considered Yemen's form of government.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> Yemen and the U.S. seem to 
have a friendly, cooperative relationship as demonstrated by their diplomatic status, the foreign assistance provided to Yemen, and the assistance/support 
provided by Yemen to the U.S. in the war against terrorism. Further, there is no evidence the government of Yemen has engaged in espionage against the U.S.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
To a certain extent, the security concerns raised by Yemen are less than those raised by a country hostile to the U.S. Nevertheless, the concerns still exist, 
because even friendly countries have interests that are contrary to the national interest of the U.S. There are, however, serious concerns raised by Yemen's 
official recognition of known terrorist organizations within its borders. Additionally, Yemen's human rights record is poor with little or no action by its 
government to prosecute or prevent its organizations from violating the human rights of its citizens.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the totality of the circumstances in Applicant's case, I find Applicant's mother and siblings are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his relatives in Yemen and loyalty to the U.S. In reaching this 
conclusion I considered the following factors: (1) Applicant's family members did not work for the Yemeni government and they live common, ordinary lives; 
(2) They are not involved in political organizations; (3) They do not dependent on Applicant's financial assistance; (4) They have infrequent contacts with 
Applicant; and (5) There has been no attempt at exploitation in the past. As such, it is not likely that their behavior would raise the interest of the Yemeni 
government in their activities or that of their relatives. Mitigating Condition (MC) 1: <EM>a determination that the immediate family members in questions are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the persons 
involved and the U.S.<A HREF="04-10430.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> </EM>applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant left his country and his Yemeni relatives in 1972 to come to the U.S. He showed his gratitude to his new country and earned resident alien status by 
serving honorably in the Army for three years. His employment at UNICEF appears to be the result of Applicant taking advantage of a great economic and 
professional opportunity, and not because of his desire to go back to live in Yemen. After working 15 years for UNICEF in Yemen, Applicant had the 
opportunity to stay in Yemen and reestablish himself in that country. He and his wife elected to come back to the U.S. every year in order to maintain their 
resident alien status and meet their naturalization requirements. After completing his tour with UNICEF, Applicant returned to the U.S. and integrated himself 
into our society. His children and wife, although born in foreign countries are now naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant's daughter's testimony and demeanor at 
the hearing showed she was raised following American (Western) customs. She was dressed and behaved as a typical college student and displayed a confident 
and outspoken personality. Applicant seemed very proud of her accomplishments in school. Her personality and demeanor leads me to believe she was not 
raised in the fundamentalist/extremist environment usually associated with people and organizations with interests inimical to the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both Applicant and his daughter work as translator/interpreters for DOD personnel in the war against terrorism and seem very proud of their contributions. 
Applicant's performance in Iraq since 2003 has been characterized as outstanding. His character references included military personnel whose lives, to some 
extent, depended on Applicant's loyalty and trustworthiness. They had the opportunity to observe Applicant on a daily basis, dealing both with Iraqis and on 
behalf of U.S. forces. They, without exception, complimented Applicant's performance and stated they would welcome Applicant's assistance in the future. In 
my view, those serving beside the Applicant in a field environment are unequally qualified to judge Applicant's loyalties. Accordingly, their recommendations 
deserve serious consideration. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions demonstrate he is not afraid of the possible adverse consequences to his family in Yemen should enemies of the U.S. find out what he (and 
his daughter) currently does for a living. Although I cannot rule out the possibility that his Yemeni family may be in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power, I do not believe that is likely to happen. Even if it were, Applicant's actions already demonstrate that his strongest ties of affection and obligation are to 
his wife and children in the U.S. and it is not likely Applicant would be forced to compromise U.S. interests because of his family in Yemen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the ultimate question - whether a person's past conduct instills confidence the 
person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's conduct is a security concern if it involves questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Such behavior could indicate that the person

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established that Applicant failed to disclose his 1976 charges and conviction. Notwithstanding, I do not believe his omissions were deliberate 
or made with the intent to falsify or mislead the government. Applicant credibly testified that he was instructed to report only charges or offenses within the last 
seven to ten years. It is not likely Applicant would have had any motive to hide the offenses in light of the fact that they happened 30 years ago, he was returned 
to his unit after serving his sentence, and he ultimately received an honorable discharge. The conviction was reflected (as days lost) on the Applicant's DD 214, 
and he knew the government would have immediate access to his military records. Guideline E is decided for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. 
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including Applicant's testimony and demeanor, the whole person concept, 
and the adjudicative factors listed in the Directive, I find Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.</SPAN></P>
