<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 63 year-old, naturalized United States citizen.  He was born in India, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> moved to the United States in 1972, and became naturalized  in 1982.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN>Applicant has several immediate family members who are citizens of and reside in India, but they are not in a position to be exploited by India in a way that 
could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States. Applicant has a strong attachment to the United 
States, with a long and successful career and substantial financial interest here, and he is unlikely to respond favorably to any efforts to act against United States 
interests.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On May 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated </SPAN>June 16, 2003<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations. He requested a clearance decision based on a 
hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 8, 2003, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the 
parties on September 2, 2003, and the hearing was held on September 15, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared with counsel, offered 
six documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - F) and offered his own testimony and the testimony of his brother and two other witnesses. The transcript (TR) was 
received on September 29, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family 
members are not United States citizens and may be subject to duress. </SPAN>The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a. through 1.f., under Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the specific allegations. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The admitted allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony of the witnesses at the hearing, and 
the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 63 years old. He <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in India, moved to the United States in 1972 and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1982. He received the 
equivalent of a masters degree in engineering and a Masters of Business Administration.</SPAN> He currently works as a principal systems engineer, for the same 
company where he has been employed for twenty years.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has never been married and has no children. Applicant assessed the net value of his assets in 
the United States at approximately one million dollars (Tr at 74, 74).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has two sisters and one brother who reside in the United States. The brother is a citizen of the United Kingdom, but he is in the process of becoming 
a United States citizen. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> also has </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">three sisters and one brother who are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and reside in India</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. His oldest sister was a translator, who worked for a local government 
agency. She has now retired and is in the process of being treated for cancer (Tr at 65, 66). His second sister works as a zoning officer where she reports to the 
police commissioner. His third sister is a lawyer and does not work in any government capacity. His brother works for a state in India, where he disburses funds 
from Norway for the poor (Tr at 80-82).While Applicant's brother and one sister are employed by local governments in India, none of his family work for the 
central government of India.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was given </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the hypothetical question </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">as to what he would do if he was ever tested as to his loyalty to the United States versus his loyalty to his 
family,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testified  that he would never betray the United States (Tr at 75, 76)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Since there has been no actual set of circumstances that occurred similar to the 
hypothetical fact pattern, I can not give his statement a great deal of consideration  ISCR Case No. 02-26826 (November 12, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, I believe that his 
testimony was credible.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to Applicant and his brother, two witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Both witnesses have known Applicant as a coworker, with whom they 
worked closely for 20 years. Both witnesses were aware of Applicant's background, and the concern of the Government regarding Applicant's potential foreign 
influence problems with India.  They strongly recommended him for a position of trust without any reservations </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 51-55, 98-103)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant also 
introduced 10 letters of reference from individuals, all of whom have known Applicant for a considerable amount of time.  They all made extremely positive 
recommendations about Applicant's trustworthiness and his character </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibit F)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2. Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3. Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN>Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant's immediate family members are citizens of and reside in</SPAN> India. The Indian citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's 
immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in 
rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a 
security clearance for him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  The evidence of existence of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN>, who are citizens of and reside in, India comes within Disqualifying Condition  E2.A2.1.2.1.  
However, based on the nature of the overall record, including: the lack of involvement of Applicant's family members with the central government of India ; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the 
successful career and </SPAN>significant financial accumulation <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that Applicant has established since coming to the United States more than 30 years ago; the extremely 
strong testimony about his feelings concerning the United States and what he would do if faced with a threat from a foreign government;</SPAN> the close relationship 
of India to the United States; and the strong recommendations for Applicant from two impressive witnesses and the individuals who wrote letters of reference, I 
have determined that his family members in India do not constitute an unacceptable security risk and Mitigating Conditions E2.A2.1.3.1 applies.  After 
considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and</SPAN>, 
even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the incident to the 
proper authorities. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is found for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
