<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 8, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under  Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative

Applicant submitted additional information in response  in the FORM within the 30-day time period provided to him. The case was assigned to me on April 10, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations </SPAN>are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old married man. He was born in Romania and moved to Israel with his parents and older brother as a child.  He became an Israeli citizen, and from November 1976 to January 
1981 performed mandatory military service in the Israeli Army Tank Corps earning the rank of Lieutenant.  His current status or future obligation, if any, with the Israeli Army is unknown.  In August 
1984, he married his Israeli-born wife in Israel, and they had two Israeli born daughters.  From September 1981 to May 1985, he attended college in Israel and was awarded a degree, major unknown.  </P> 
 
<P>In November 1988, Applicant, his spouse and two daughters immigrated to the U.S.  He entered the U.S. under an H-1, Needed Profession Visa.  In March 1999, Applicant and his wife became 
naturalized U.S. citizens.  Applicant's two daughters also became U.S. citizens at an unknown date.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  After arriving in the U.S., Applicant and his wife had their third and last child, a U.S. born son.  
Since June 1988, Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor as Vice President of Advanced Engineering. He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, his wife, and two daughters are dual citizens of Israel and the U.S.  Applicant currently holds an Israeli passport issued to him in January 1997, renewed in March 2002, which will not expire 
until January 2007.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant has expressed his willingness to surrender his Israeli passport in order to support his security clearance application.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The record contains no  affirmative evidence that 
he has relinquished his Israeli passport.  Applicant has also held a U.S. passport since at least May 1999.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father, brother, parents-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law are resident citizens of Israel.  He maintains bi-weekly telephone contact with his father and brother, he maintains 
approximate once weekly telephone or e-mail contact with his parents-in-law, and he maintains approximate once monthly telephone or e-mail contact with his brother-in-law and sister-in-law.  Nothing 
in the FORM indicates what any of Applicant's Israeli relatives do for a living,  what they did for a living if they are retired, or what connection, if any, they have with the Israeli government.</P> 
 
<P>Since 1973, Applicant has maintained a close, personal relationship with a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S., who resides in the U.S.  Since 2002, Applicant has also maintained a close, personal 
relationship with an Israeli citizen, who resides in the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>Between the approximate dates of July 1997 and August 2003, Applicant traveled to Israel on five occasions, using his Israeli passport.  Also, during the approximate date of July 2000, Applicant 
traveled to Israel using his U.S. passport.</P> 
 
<P>Except for using his Israeli passport, Applicant claimed he has not exercised any rights, privileges, or benefits of being an Israeli citizen such as voting in an Israeli election.  He has no financial interests 
in Israel and affirms his allegiance is to the U.S.   </P> 
 
<P>Israel is a modern, well developed country, with a history of past and present tension with its Arab neighbors.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The government submitted evidence of recent cases of individuals engaging in espionage 
on behalf of Israel against the U.S., as it pertained to matters within the defense industry.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. The administrative judge must take into account 
both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances of the case. The guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured 
against them as they represent policy guidance governing the granting or denial of access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an 
Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and the whole person concept.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Having considered the 
record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">are the applicable relevant adjudicative guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The 
government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish by substantial evidence<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> a prima facie case that it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest for the applicant to have access to classified information. The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. 
Because no one has a right to a security <A NAME="Document2zzSDUNumber10"></A>clearance, the applicant carries a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest to ensure 
each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" 
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> security concern exists when an individual's immediate family and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of 
other countries are also relevant if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In addition, common sense suggests </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that the stronger the ties of affection or 
obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative or close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In every security clearance case an applicant's ties or connections to any foreign country require careful examination.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Notwithstanding, the mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign 
country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The language of the foreign influence guideline does not require a conclusion that an unacceptable security concern exists based solely on an applicant's 
family ties in a foreign country.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding if the facts and circumstances of an applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable 
security concern or risk.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The government established a prima facie case under Guideline B by showing that Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">has close ties of affection or obligation with his father, brother, parents-in-law, and brother-in-law and 
sister-in-law, who are resident citizens of Israel.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The strength of his relationship is demonstrated, to a certain extent, by his frequent contacts with his family, and numerous visits to his family in 
Israel. The fact that Applicant has close ties of affection to persons who are either citizens or residents of Israel is sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's vulnerability to 
coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a foreign country.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection

foreign influence or duress exists</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> apply.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In deciding whether Applicant's family members are in a position to be exploited, I considered, among other things, past instances of espionage against the U.S., especially in the area of defense related 
matters.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  That being said, the U.S. and Israel seem to have a friendly, cooperative relationship as demonstrated by their diplomatic status, and mutual cooperation, which is more often than not the 
case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> Nevertheless, the concerns still exist, because even friendly countries have interests that are contrary to the national interest of the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It was the Applicant's responsibility to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's foreign influence concerns raised by his family ties. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The record is silent as to whether any of Applicant's Israeli 
family members are agents of a foreign power<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> or employed by or connected to a foreign government or in positions where they are likely to be exploited by a foreign power. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The lack of information 
concerning Applicant's relatives, and his failure to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">demonstrate that his family members are not in a position to be exploited, by either coercive or non-coercive means, by a foreign government in a way 
that could force him to choose between loyalty to those relatives and loyalty to the U.S., precludes a finding that any of the Guideline B mitigating conditions apply.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), a security concern exists when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The government established a prima facie case under Guideline C by showing that Applicant maintains an Israeli passport.  Applicant has exercised dual citizenship and a foreign country preference by 
traveling on an Israeli passport after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  Applicant has admitted all allegations under Guideline C, namely, dual citizenship, possession/use of an Israeli passport, 
repeated travel to Israel, and Israeli military service for over four years.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  Despite his offer to do so, there is no evidence that Applicant has taken any affirmative steps to relinquish his Israeli passport.  
Under current guidelines, his continued possession of a foreign passport is a bar to holding a security clearance.  Even if Applicant were to now relinquish his Israeli passport, his history of past use, as 
an exercise of the privilege of Israeli citizenship, remains a continuing Guideline C concern.  Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: <EM>The exercise of dual citizenship; </EM>and DC 2: <EM>Possession 
and/or use of a foreign passport </EM>and the Money Memorandum applies.  Possession and use of an Israeli passport <EM>per se </EM>precludes Applicant from holding a security clearance absent approval from 
proper authority.  Under current DoD guidelines a favorable finding under this concern is not authorized.<A HREF="05-03529.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have carefully weighed all the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines.  Considering all relevant and 
material facts and circumstances present in this case, including Applicant's statement, his family ties to foreign nationals, exercise of dual citizenship, possession of an Israeli passport, the whole person 
concept, and the adjudicative factors listed in the Directive, I find Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.</SPAN></P>
