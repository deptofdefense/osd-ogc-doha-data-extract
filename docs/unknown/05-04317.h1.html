<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 4 November 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of personal 
conduct, sexual behavior, and misuse of information technology systems.<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR 23 December 2005 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 8 May 2006, 
and I convened a hearing 14 September 2006. DOHA received the transcript on 25 September 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for SOR 1.d., which he denied because he claims his wife is now aware of the misconduct alleged in the SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He is a 47-year-old senior 
systems administrator employed by a defense contractor. He seeks to retain the clearances he has held in the military and industry since approximately 1978.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In September 1991, Applicant was arrested for trespassing and invasion of privacy, when he was caught looking at a female acquaintance through an open window at her house (G.E. 2, 3). The 
charges were eventually placed on the stet docket on condition that he complete a psychiatric evaluation at the county health department (G.E. 4). Although the evaluation did not find that Applicant 
suffered from any psychiatric condition, Applicant disclosed that he had hoped to view the woman wearing few or no clothes (G.E. 5). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 2002, Applicant was fired from his job with a government contractor for viewing pornographic material on his government computer, in violation of the company's computer use policy 
(G.E. 6).<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> At the time of his termination, Applicant had been viewing pornographic websites every few days until he was caught.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In November 2003, Applicant was fired from his job with a different employer for violating company computer use policy prohibiting access to pornographic material (G.E. 7, 8, 9). Applicant 
asserts that he accessed the site inadvertently, but acknowledges that he deleted the offending email from his computer before he could assert his innocent access (Tr. 40-50).<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2004 (G.E. 7), Applicant disclosed that his wife was not aware of the 1991 arrest, and was not aware of the reasons for his 
being fired from his jobs in June 2002 and November 2003. However, he claimed that he would rather have her know about these incidents than be subject to potential coercion over them. 
Nevertheless, while he claims that his wife is now aware of these incidents, he did not reveal them to her until he received the SOR in November 2005 (Tr. 62).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's response to the allegations in this case is that he has held a clearance for 28 years without compromising classified information (Tr. 29), and believes that disclosing classified 
information is wrong (Tr. 63).</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Guideline 
 (Misuse of Information Technology Systems).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less 
than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard 
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His "peeping tom" arrest in 1991 and his two terminations in 18 
months for accessing pornographic websites on work computers demonstrate extraordinarily poor judgement inconsistent with access to classified information.<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The fact that his wife may not 
know about these incidents<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> leaves him potentially subject to coercion.<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline D, by demonstrating that Applicant was arrested on "peeping tom" charges in September 1991,<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and that his wife is unaware 
of this arrest, as well as the true circumstances of his being fired in June 2002 and November 2003.<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> These three incidents occurred at work and other public places.<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his sexual behavior. The misconduct is recent.<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant was not an adolescent at the time of the misconduct.<A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Applicant has not 
established that his wife is aware of his misconduct, or that he cannot be influenced by his past sexual behavior.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-04317.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I resolve Guideline D against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline M. First, the government's evidence does not establish that the company computers (or the government computer in 
SOR 1.b.) were "information technology systems" as contemplated by the Directive, i.e. equipment dealing with classified or sensitive information. Second, although Applicant's conduct violated 
company policy for internet use, that fact alone does not invoke any of the disqualifying conditions under the guideline. I conclude Guideline M for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
