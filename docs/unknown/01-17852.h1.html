<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 15, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 12, 2001. The case was assigned to the undersigned on January 2, 2002. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on January 18, 2002, and the hearing was held on February 12, 2002. The transcript was received on February 20, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is forty-two years of age. He has been offered a job with a defense contractor on the condition that he first receive a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Appellant went on active duty with the United States Army as an officer in 1982  following graduation from a university. The evidence establishes that he 
served honorably and with distinction<A HREF="01-17852.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> until November1995. Based on an early morning incident at a friend's house in November 1995,<A HREF="01-17852.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> applicant was charged 
with (1) Rape, a violation of Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), (2) Sodomy by force and without consent, a violation of Article 125 
of the UCMJ, and (3) Indecent Assault, a violation of Article 134 of the UCMJ. Based on a false statement he made about the incident, he was also charged 
with Conduct Unbecoming an Officer, a violation of Article 133 of the UCMJ.</SPAN> After a trial by general court-martial in 1996, he was found guilty of all four 
offenses. In April 1996, he was sentenced to forfeiture of all pay and allowances, confinement for nine years, and dismissal. The convening authority upheld the 
sentence except for the period of confinement,  which was reduced to thirty months. With the reduction in the period of confinement, applicant became eligible 
for parole after serving ten months. He was granted parole at his first parole hearing in April 1997.</P> 
 
<P>Although it is obvious that applicant believes he was unjustly convicted, he is legally barred from challenging his conviction during the DOHA hearing.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant offered into evidence over 100 letters of support from various people including family members, acquaintances, neighbors, close friends, and fellow 
Army officers. I have carefully reviewed these letters. To the extent some of these letters claim that applicant was innocent of the charges, they were not 
considered.  The remainder of the letters were considered, and in essence, they describe applicant as a truly incredible individual in terms of his good judgment, 
reliability and trustworthiness (Exhibits B, C, D and E). Many of these letters claim that the conduct applicant was charged with and convicted of is completely 
out of character for him. Of particular significance were the recently written letters of support recommending that he be granted a security clearance from the 
two retired colonels and three lieutenant colonels who served with applicant, and the letters attesting to applicant's current good judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness from his current supervisor, a fellow member of the high school booster club, and a member of the local school board (Exhibit E).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Army officer who has known applicant for fifteen years appeared at the hearing and testified that he "would stake his life on (applicant's) character" (TR at 
15). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></SPAN><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise security concerns and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Guidelines are applicable:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1. E2.A10.1.2.1: Criminal conduct.</P> 
 
<P>2. E2.A10.1.2.2: A single serious crime or multiple lessor offenses.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. E2.A10.1.3.1: The criminal behavior was not recent.</P> 
 
<P>2. E2.A10.1.3.4: The factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur.</P> 
 
<P>In addition to the formal Guidelines discussed above, the Enclosure 2 of the Directive provides that each decision should take into consideration the following 
factors:</P> 
 
<P>The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation;</P> 
 
<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The voluntariness of participation;</P> 
 
<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;</P> 
 
<P>The motivation for the conduct;</P> 
 
<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and</P> 
 
<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The evidence establishes that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applicant went on active duty with the United States Army as an officer </SPAN>in 1982. His Officer Evaluation Reports and numerous 
letters of support admitted into evidence establish that he served honorably and with distinction until that fateful night in November 1995.  Despite the fact that 
applicant and many of his supporters felt he was not treated fairly by the military justice system, the fact remains that he was convicted of four very serious 
charges.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's conduct during the night in question, and his unwillingness to initially tell the truth about the incident,<A HREF="01-17852.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> are inexcusable. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even if he sincerely 
believed the woman was interested in him, </SPAN>he had no right to take <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">advantage of her when he knew she was too intoxicated to resist his sexual advances.  By 
doing so, he </SPAN>exercised extremely poor judgment, and he compounded the poor judgment when he failed to tell the truth about his actions when interviewed in 
January 1996.</P> 
 
<P>Although applicant's criminal conduct militates  against the granting of a security clearance, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">his long track record of good judgment, reliability and  
trustworthiness, both before and after the incident, which has been so clearly demonstrated by the evidence in the record,  must be considered under the "whole 
person" concept discussed in the Directive.<A HREF="01-17852.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN> In short, applicant's lapses in judgment relating to the incident, albeit major lapses, must be considered in the 
context of his otherwise twenty years of highly responsible conduct. And, when applicant's conduct is viewed in this context, it becomes apparent that his 
criminal conduct was completely out of character for him.</P> 
 
<P>Given this fact, the isolated nature of the conduct, the fact that it occurred over six years ago, and the fact that applicant has led an exemplary lifestyle since 
being released from prison in 1996, I conclude that there is little or no chance that applicant will exercise such poor judgment in the future.  If it were not for 10 
U.S.C. 986, I would conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant applicant access to classified information at the present time. 
However, in light of this statute, I must conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant applicant a security clearance. However, I 
recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER>

<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for applicant.</P>
