<P>Although the Applicant's alleged Sexual Behavior and related Personal Conduct are not of security significance, the same can not be said as to the Applicant's 
Personality Disorder and Alcohol Consumption.  In May of 2004, the Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from a Generalized Anxiety Disorder and from 
Alcohol Abuse.  The clinical psychologist averred that the "condition could result in defects in judgment, reliability, and stability."  The psychologist further 
averred that the Applicant "needs to stop drinking alcohol entirely as it impairs his judgment . . . ."  The Applicant still consumes alcohol, and there is no 
countervailing opinion by a credentialed mental health professional as to his reliability.  Mitigation is not shown.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 28, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.  Applicant filed an Answer to 
the SOR on October 18, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on November 24, 2004.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on December 7, 2004, and Applicant's Response was received on or about January 6, 2005.  The case was 
received by the undersigned for resolution that same day.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Department Counsel, objects to the admission of Item 1 of the Applicant's Response.  Department Counsel avers that this one page document, "Criminal 
Person Case Listing from Tarrant County District Clerk's database with regard to . . . [the mother of the Applicant's alleged accuser]," does not come within the 
purview of Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 608 and 609<A HREF="03-23727.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>.  Under subparagraph E3.1.19 of the Directive, however, the "technical rules of evidence may be 
relaxed" in favor of "a full and complete record."  Item 1 is relevant, material and helps to provide a full and complete record.  Items 1~14 of the Applicant's 
Response are therefore admitted into evidence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's Personality Disorder, Alcohol Involvement, and alleged </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sexual Behavior and related Personal Conduct 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis regarding the Personality Disorder and Alcohol 
Involvement, but denies the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sexual Behavior and the related Personal Conduct</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 46 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline I - Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders, Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption &amp; Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.a. and 4.b.  In March of 1990, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently pled guilty to, Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) (FORM Item 4 at page 1).  He 
was fined $400 and sentenced to 90 days confinement (<EM>Id</EM>).  The confinement was suspended (<EM>Ibid</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. and 3.b.  In May of 2004, the Applicant was evaluated by a clinical psychologist (FORM Item 8).  The Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from a 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Alcohol Abuse on Axis I, and as having "Dependent traits, avoidant personality features" on Axis II (<EM>Id</EM> at page 2).  The 
RECOMMENDATION of the psychologist was, in part, the following:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The extent and duration of these diagnoses is(<EM>sic</EM>) most of his life for the anxiety and probably for the personality traits.  The prognosis is good if he engages in 
psychotherapy, has medication for anxiety and depression, and experiences success for tentative efforts at more assertive and competent behavior.  <STRONG>The 
condition could result in defects in judgement, reliability, and stability</STRONG>.  This is because [of] great dependency needs and high fear of rejection which make 
him vulnerable to being manipulated by someone pretending to be his friend. . . . If he does not engage in psychotherapy, I expect his present condition to 
continue indefinitely.  <STRONG>He needs to stop drinking alcohol entirely </STRONG>as it impairs his judgment as well as his ability to process information (<EM>Id</EM>, emphasis 
supplied).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant avers that "[w]ith medication, I am virtually free of most symptoms" (FORM Item 3 at page 5).  He further avers "I 
have greatly reduced the amount of alcohol I consume" (FORM Item 3 at page 6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline D - Sexual Behavior &amp; Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a.~2.d, and 4.a.  The allegations of improper Sexual Behavior are, for the most part, based on allegations by the mother of a, then, minor child, as to sexual 
conduct that, allegedly, occurred more than 20 years ago (FORM Item 6).  [There is no statement from the former minor child who is now in his late 20s.]  The 
accuser wishes to keep this matter out of the courts in exchange for monetary consideration (<EM>Id</EM>).  The Applicant vehemently denies the gravamen of her 
allegations.  He does admit, however, getting sexual gratification by brushing up against the then, minor child (FORM Item 5).  He further admits fantasizing 
about prepubescent boys and masturbating (<EM>Id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Response to the FORM, the Applicant offers the affidavits of eleven individuals who have known the Applicant for from 4~23 years (Response Items 
2~12).  All are most laudatory in their comments as to the Applicant, and, for the most part, believe he "is honest, trustworthy, hardworking, dependable and 
loyal" (<EM>Id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy 
in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders), Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline G 
(Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a 
rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect 
to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who suffers from a mental disorder may have a defect in judgement, reliability or stability.  Alcohol abuse often leads to the exercise of 
questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  
The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in 
all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is suffering from a personality disorder, which, in the opinion of a credentialed mental health professional, "could result in defects in judgement, 
reliability, and stability."  The first disqualifying condition is therefore applicable as there is an "opinion by a credentialed mental health professional that the 
individual has a condition that may indicate a defect in judgement, reliability, and stability."  The Applicant avers that "[w]ith medication, I am virtually free of 
most symptoms," but there is no countervailing mitigating condition.  According to the clinical psychologist the questionable personality disorder is current, 
continuing, and this diagnosis is unrebutted.  Guideline I is thus found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering next the Applicant's Alcohol Consumption, he has also been diagnosed as suffering from alcohol abuse.  The third disqualifying condition is 
therefore applicable, as there is a "[d]iagnosis by a credentialed medical professional . . . of alcohol abuse . . . ."  The psychologist further opines that the 
Applicant "needs to stop drinking alcohol entirely as it impairs his judgment as well as his ability to process information."  Although the Applicant has "greatly 
reduced" his alcohol consumption, he still consumes the intoxicant.  The first disqualifying condition is also, arguably, applicable for in 1990 he was convicted 
of a DWI.  Although this "[a]lcohol-related incident" occurred more than 14 years ago, it is symptomatic of one suffering from alcohol abuse.  Again, there is 
no countervailing mitigating condition, as the Applicant has neither "completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation," nor "abstained from alcohol for a period 
of at least 12 months."  Guideline G is also found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the Applicant's Sexual Behavior and related Personal Conduct, arguably, the first disqualifying condition under Sexual Behavior is applicable, as he got 
sexual gratification by brushing up against a minor child.  This is "[s]exual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted."  
However, this occurred more than 20 years ago; and as such, the second mitigating condition is applicable as the "behavior was not recent and there is no 
evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature."  Guidelines D and E are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his personality disorder, and his alcohol abuse.  The Applicant has 
thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines I and G, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of 
persuasion under Guidelines I and G.</SPAN></P>
