<P>The Applicant used cocaine, with varying frequency, from 1986 to 1991.  In September of 1991, she was diagnosed as suffering from "Cocaine dependence, 
continuous."  Her prognosis was "Fair with treatment."  In September or October of 1998, however, she "started snorting cocaine on a daily basis."  This 
continued until June of 1999.  Since her relapse, the Applicant has not completed any drug treatment program, nor has she received a favorable prognosis.  
itigation is not shown.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about October 30, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on January 28, 2004.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on February 23, 2004, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was originally assigned to another judge in 
April of 2004, but reassigned to the undersigned for resolution on June 7, 2004.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's drug abuse militates against 
the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant, for the most part, denies the underlying factual basis for the four allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 42 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H - Drug Involvement</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.~1.b.  The Applicant used marijuana "at least eight to ten times from about 1979 through 1983" (Item 6 at page 1).  Her more recent drug involvement is 
with cocaine.  She describes her first period of cocaine abuse in the following terms:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I first used cocaine in 1986 when I was at a party with friends.  I snorted a line a(<EM>sic</EM>) cocaine.  I used it occasionally on holidays or when parties were held 
throughout the year.  I cannot recall my specific use of cocaine, but estimate that I used it at least twelve times yearly from 1986 through 1990.  In 1991, I 
became depressed and started using cocaine more often.  I used it two or three times per week on average until I admitted myself into . . . [treatment] (Item 6 at 
page 1).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant received treatment from September 5 through September 14 of 1991 (Item 7 at page 1).  Her doctor diagnoses the Applicant as suffering, in part, 
from "Cocaine dependence, continuous" (Item 7 at page 3).  Her prognosis was noted as "Fair with treatment" (<EM>id</EM>).  In 1998, however, the Applicant had a 
relapse (Item 5).  She avers the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I was drug free until about Sep/Oct 98 when I was in a bad relationship with a man and we were breaking up.  I felt a great deal of stress and pressure.  I started 
snorting cocaine on a daily basis in order to escape reality. . . . I hung out with other cocaine users and would chip in money to buy cocaine.  At first I spent 
about $200.00 per week. . . . Gradually the amount I spend on cocaine declined to about $20.00 per week and eventually I got it for free from friends. . . . I 
stopped using cocaine in Jun 99 (Item 5 at pages 1~2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant avers that she does not intend any future drug abuse (Item 5 at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out its case under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all 
places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in her private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate 
the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from "Cocaine dependence, continuous" in 1991. Her prognosis was listed as "Fair with treatment."  The third 
Disqualifying Condition is therefore clearly applicable as there is a "[d]iagnosis by a credentialed medical professional . . . of drug abuse or drug dependence."  
This diagnosis followed about five years of cocaine abuse.  The first and second Disqualifying Conditions are also applicable as there is firstly "drug abuse," 
and secondly "[i]llegal drug possession, including . . . purchase."  Furthermore, I can find no applicable Mitigating Conditions that apply.  From September or 
October of 1998 to June of 1999, a period of about eight months, the Applicant returned to her cocaine abuse, at times on a daily basis.  The fact that the 
Applicant returned to her cocaine dependency after seven years of being drug free, makes her current five years of abstinence too recent to apply the first 
itigating Condition.  The fourth Mitigating Condition is also not applicable as it requires the "[s]atisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment 
program . . . without recurrence of abuse."  Clearly, that is not the case here.  The Applicant Drug Involvement is therefore of present security significance; and 
as such, Guideline H is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding her drug involvement.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline H, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline 
H.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
