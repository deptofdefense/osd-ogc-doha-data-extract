<P>Applicant was born in Iraq, became a U.S. citizen, and is now a well-respected and trusted linguist working for a defense contractor in Iraq.  Three of his six 
sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq.  The record does contain any information about his sisters' families, occupations, or their political, economic, and 
social ties in Iraq.  The security concern based on foreign influence is not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 26, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), based on the Iraqi citizenship of his spouse and 
her family (&para;&para; 1.a. and 1.c.), the Iraqi citizenship and residence of his three sisters(&para; 1.b.), and Applicant's travel to Iraq in 2001 to visit his family (&para; 1.d.).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 12, 2005, and elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Applicant admitted 
the allegations in the SOR but explained he and his spouse were divorced on July 7, 2005.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on 
August 2, 2005.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and 
submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on September 10, 2005, and responded on 
September 28, 2005.  His response was received on October 24, 2005.  The case was assigned to me on November 28, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 46-year-old linguist for a defense contractor.  He has been working in Iraq with the U.S. forces since 2003.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly respected by his military and civilian supervisors.  One military supervisor, a U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, regards him as "an 
invaluable asset," based on his linguistic skills, professionalism, sense of duty, and dedication to the mission.  Another military supervisor, a U.S. Army 
lieutenant colonel, cited his bravery, hard work, selflessness, language skills, "keen personal insights" and "cultural acumen."  A third military supervisor, an 
Air Force captain, described him as one of his "most versatile linguists," a "production powerhouse," and "a meticulous worker."  The captain stated, "I wish I 
had a dozen more exemplary workers like [Applicant].  A civilian supervisor praised Applicant's knowledge, insights, skills, and professional attitude.  
Applicant has received several certificates of appreciation for his work in Iraq.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Iraq.  He served in the Iraqi Army from November 1977 to February 1988.  He immigrated to the U.S. in 1990, and became a naturalized 
U.S. citizen in 1998.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents are deceased.  He has six sisters.  Two are citizens and residents of the U.S., one is a citizen and resident of Germany, and three are citizens 
and residents of Iraq.  Before coming to Iraq, Applicant contacted his sisters every four or five months.  Since arriving in Iraq, he has not contacted his sisters 
because of local rules forbidding him from leaving his base or contacting anyone in the local area under any circumstances.  There is no evidence in the record 
regarding his sisters' families, occupations, or their political, economic, and social ties in Iraq.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled to Iraq in December 2001 to plan his marriage and visit his family.  He stayed in Iraq for about three weeks.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was married to an Iraqi citizen in July 2002, and his spouse became a permanent resident of the U.S.  Her family remained in Iraq.  Applicant and his 
spouse were divorced on July 7, 2005.  Applicant has no contact with his ex-wife or her family.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Iraq is a "transitional democracy," in the process of establishing an effective democratic government.<A HREF="04-02264.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  While the Iraqi government is friendly to and supported 
by the U.S., the country remains very dangerous, with both internal and external terrorist forces and criminal elements targeting Iraqi government facilities and 
personnel, Iraqi private citizens, and U.S. forces.<A HREF="04-02264.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  The totality of an applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR 
Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant divorced his Iraqi wife and has no contact with her or her family.  Thus, he has refuted the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.a. and 1.c.  However, DC 1 is 
established because three of Applicant's sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the government  produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who 
are connected with a foreign government, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members, cohabitant, or associate(s) in question 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power"). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with 
the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion.  The 
risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or 
dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presented no evidence concerning his sisters' families, occupations, or their political, economic, and social ties in Iraq.  Therefore, i</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">t is not possible to 
assess the vulnerability of Applicant's sisters to coercion, persuasion, or duress based on the record in this case.  Applicant has the burden of proving a 
mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of establishing MC 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  There is a 
rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 
2002).  Applicant had regular contacts with his sisters until his deployment to Iraq.  Applicant's travel to Iraq in 2001 (SOR &para; 1.d.) demonstrated his ties of 
affection to his family in Iraq. The evidence reflects he temporarily ceased contact with his sisters because of local rules forbidding it while he is in Iraq.  His 
temporary cessation of contact under these circumstances does not establish a mitigating condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There is no doubt Applicant is a loyal, brave, talented, and dedicated U.S. citizen.  However, the record does not establish he is free from conflicting allegiances 
that could require him to make a choice between loyalty to his sisters and the U.S.  His sisters live in an often-lawless, dangerous country.  After considering the 
disqualifying condition established by the evidence and the absence of mitigating conditions, and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concern based on foreign influence.</SPAN></P>
