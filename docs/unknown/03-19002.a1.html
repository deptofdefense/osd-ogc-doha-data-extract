  Considering the record evidence as a whole, and giving due deference to the Administrative Judge's assessment of the credibility of Applicant's testimony, the Board concludes the Judge's findings of falsification are sustainable.  Deliberate falsifications have negative security implications that are  independent from the security implications of the conduct that an applicant tries to conceal.  The federal government does not have to wait until an applicant  commits a security violation before it can deny or revoke access to classified information.  The possibility that an unfavorable decision could adversely affect  Applicant's employment situation and career is not relevant to the Judge's evaluation of the security significance of Applicant's falsifications.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 3, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated January 26, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's findings of falsification are supported by the record evidence as a 
whole; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's conduct was not extenuated or mitigated; and (3) whether the Administrative 
Judge's unfavorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's findings of falsification are supported by the record evidence as a whole</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that 
Applicant falsified a security clearance application in June 2001 by failing to disclose that: (a) he had been involved in a January 1998 driving incident 
involving drugs; (b) he had used marijuana in the past; and (c) had three delinquent debts.  The Judge also found that Applicant falsified material facts during 
an October 2001 interview by stating he had received a general discharge from the military for medical reasons, when he had in fact received a discharge under 
other than honorable conditions.  On appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge's findings of falsification.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge had to consider the record evidence as a whole and make findings of fact about Applicant's intent or state of mind when Applicant 
omitted information from the security clearance application, and when he made a statement to an investigator during the October 2001 interview about the 
nature and circumstances of his discharge from the military.  Applicant's denials of any intent to conceal facts or deceive or mislead the federal government had 
to be considered by the Judge, but those denials were not binding or conclusive on the Judge.  Rather, the Judge had to consider Applicant's denials and 
explanations in light of the Judge's assessment of the credibility of Applicant's testimony and the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-26360 (June 23, 2004) at p. 3.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, and giving due deference to the Judge's assessment of the credibility of Applicant's 
testimony,<A HREF="03-19002.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> the Board concludes that the Judge's findings of falsification are sustainable.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's findings of falsification is 
not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's findings are erroneous and not supported by the record evidence.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's conduct was not extenuated or mitigated</SPAN>.  Applicant asserts that he was truthful and 
forthcoming with the investigator about his past criminal conduct, that he felt he corrected any mistakes or omissions in his security clearance application 
through his disclosures to the investigator, and he has regretted his mistakes and past misconduct.  The Board construes Applicant's statements as raising the 
issue of whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's conduct was not extenuated or mitigated.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's past criminal conduct and past drug abuse had been mitigated, but that Applicant's falsifications were not 
extenuated or mitigated.  It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to distinguish between Applicant's past misconduct and Applicant's falsifications about 
that past misconduct.  Deliberate falsifications have negative security implications that are independent from the security implications of the conduct that an 
applicant tries to conceal.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-12329 (December 18, 2003) at pp. 3-4.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge's conclusion on 
this aspect of the case is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Applicant also asserts that: (a) he cannot be 
blackmailed because of his past; (b) he  is not a threat to the national security; and (c) he needs a security clearance for his career.  The Board construes these 
statements as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>The federal government does not have to wait until an applicant commits a security violation before it can deny or revoke access to classified information.  
<EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Furthermore, Department Counsel does not have to prove that an 
applicant presents an imminent threat to national security before an Administrative Judge can make an unfavorable security clearance decision.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 02-02892 (June 28, 2004) at p. 7.</P> 
<P>Serious security concerns would be raised if an applicant's conduct or circumstances placed the applicant in a position of vulnerability to blackmail or coercion.  
However, the federal government can deny or revoke access to classified information on grounds unrelated to vulnerability to blackmail or coercion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 02-11570 (May 19, 2004) at p. 6.  The Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's falsifications provide a sufficient 
basis for his adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility, even without any finding that Applicant is vulnerable to blackmail or coercion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 02-12329 (December 18, 2003) at p. 4 (discussing security significance of falsifications).</P> 
<P>There is no right to a security clearance.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Furthermore, the possibility that an unfavorable security 
clearance decision could adversely affect Applicant's employment situation and career is not relevant to the Administrative Judge's evaluation of the security 
significance of Applicant's falsifications.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-21851 (April 18, 2003) at p. 4.</P> 
<P>For all the foregoing reasons, the Board concludes Applicant has not shown that the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision is arbitrary, capricious, or 
contrary to law.</P>
