<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 44-year-old engineer has finally paid off or otherwise resolved his massive delinquent debts, but he has not mitigated or extenuated his falsification of answers to four important questions on 
his security clearance application.  Mitigation has not been shown as to Guidelines  E and J.  Clearance is denied. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 20, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 29, 2005, Applicant submitted a Response to the allegations set forth in the SOR (RTSOR), and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge based on the written 
record; i.e., without a hearing.  A File of Relevant Materials (FORM) was issued on December 12, 2005. Applicant was notified that any response to the FORM had to be submitted within 30 days 
of receipt.  The response was due by January 14, 2006.  A timely response (RTF), was received at DOHA.  The matter was referred to me for decision on January 25, 2006. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old engineer for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains 16  allegations under Guideline F (Financial), 1.a.-1.p.; four allegations under Guideline E (Personal Conduct); and 
one allegation under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) (Item 1). In his response, Applicant admits Guideline F allegations 1.b.,1.k., and denies all others, 1.a., 1.c.- 1.j., and 1.l. - 1.p. He denies all 
four Guideline E allegations, 2.a.- 2.d., and he denies the single Guideline J allegation, 3.a.  The factual admissions are accepted and incorporated as Findings of Fact.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As detailed in the SOR, Applicant owed the following delinquent debts:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.p. - Applicant's Personal Financial Statement, dated June 10, 2004, shows a monthly remainder of $2,201.00, but Applicant has made little effort to pay on his delinquent debts as cited in the 
SOR.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.a. - The intentional falsifications alleged under 2.a.-2.d., above, each constitute a violation of 10 U.S.C 1001, a felony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the 
presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood 
of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether 
it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of 
having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those 
controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security 
concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old (born in November 1960) technical instructor. Applicant's explanations appear in his RTSOR and RTF.  Based on the information in the now closed record, I conclude 
the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Guideline F (Financial)</EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a. - Debt of $3,079.00 - Applicant claims this debt was allocated to his wife in the divorce decree and was settled by her in 1999 (Item 3). He has obtained and submitted a document from this 
creditor, showing the debt as recently "paid in full" (Tab A);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b. - Debt of $135.00 - Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3).  He has submitted a copy of a cashed check showing this payment in July 2005 (Tab B);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c. - Debt of $186.00 - Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3). He has submitted a copy of a cashed check showing this payment in September 2005 (Tab C);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.,1.h.,1.i., and 1.j.  - Debts of $50.00, $96.00, $180.00, and $630.00, respectively, owed to same medical facility - Applicant claims these debts have been paid off (Item 3).  He has submitted a 
copy of statements from this creditor showing the debt as paid off (Tabs H, I, and J).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e. - Debt of $1,429.00 - Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3).  He has submitted a copy of a statement from this creditor showing the debt as 'Paid in Full," as of September 22, 
2005 (Tab E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. - Debt of $144.00 -  Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.g. - Debt of $13,690.00 - Applicant claims this creditor agreed to settle the debt for $5,000, to be paid by October 6, 2005 (Tab G).  The creditor acknowledged the payment and provided a letter 
stating that there was "no longer a balance due and owing" (Tab GG).   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.k. - Debt of $4,367.00 - Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3).  He has submitted a copy of an official check to this creditor for this amount, dated October 4, 2005 (Tab K). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.l. - Debt of $180.00 - Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3).  He has submitted a receipt from this creditor showing the debt as paid off as of January 2000 (Tab L). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.m. - Debt of $71.00 - Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3).  He has submitted a copy of a statement showing this debt as paid off (Tab M);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.n. - Debt of $244.00 - Applicant claims this debt has been paid in full (Item 3).  He has submitted a copy of a cashed check to this creditor conforming this pay off (date not clear) (Tab N).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The specific debts cited in the SOR are derived from various credit reports in the file.  While credit reports are generally accurate and probative, they are not always so.  Indeed, some of the admitted 
credit reports contain different debt figures and information from different reporting agencies.  This is the case in the present matter.  Applicant has submitted new information and documentation 
showing that he has paid off or otherwise resolved all of the debts cited in the SOR, beginning in 2005.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record suggests that Applicant's debt load was not the result of extravagant living but, rather, the results of a failed marriage and divorce.  His failure to pay off the debts earlier is a negative 
factor, but he did pay them off months before the hearing.  I have given careful attention to his last statement on this matter, in his January 10, 2006 letter to DOHA:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Finally, my financial situation was so distorted for years as a result of argument of     ownership of debt, of this joint account as a result that was over the course of time it    was easier to ignore 
than to deal with.  As a result of this inquiry, I finally had to face    the issue.  In filling out the Security Form in haste, I was not considerate [<EM>sic</EM>] of that    past mess.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's financial conduct has not always shown the best of judgment, once his attention became focused by the present adjudication, he followed through and paid off or otherwise 
resolved the cited delinquent debts, some of which he still believes belonged to his ex-wife.  Overall, I conclude he has learned the lessons of financial rehabilitation and can be relied upon to avoid 
delinquencies in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          <EM>Guideline E (Personal Conduct) -</EM> The Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          2.a. - Applicant claims that the arrest was not "legitimate," since he did not spend a night in jails.  The record shows that he was formally charged with assault and the prosecutor had to file a 
motion to dismiss to end the case.  Under the clear language of the question, Applicant should have reported this arrest, and his explanation is simply not credible.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         2.b. -2.d. - There is no question that Applicant knew about the cited delinquent debts and  intentionally failed to report them.  His explanations fail to mitigate that fact and are not credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">            Disqualifying Conditions - (2) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar forms to determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and (5) A pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating Conditions that could mitigate security concerns: None that are established by the record; e.g., the falsifications were not an isolated incident, were recent, and the individual did not 
provide correct information voluntarily, and before  being confronted with the facts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> It is not clear exactly what Applicant means by his explanations.  His last statement on his state of mind when he completed the SCA appears in his response to the SOR, where he states: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"As a 
result of this inquiry [into his finances], I finally had to face this issue [of delinquent debts].  In filling out the Security Form in haste, I was not considerate (<EM>sic</EM>) of that past mess."  In context, it 
seems most likely that he means that his "haste" in answering questions about his finances led him to forget  that he had the cited delinquent debts.  Whatever he meant. his words lack credibility in 
light of the significant number of debts, the large dollar amounts, and the continuation and recency of the debts.  Whatever Applicant was thinking at the time, he signed off on the SCA as accurate 
and complete, when clearly, he knew and had reason to know, it was not.  This is not an acceptable excuse.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>GUIDELINE J</EM> (Criminal Conduct) - The Concern: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New">Disqualifying Conditions: (1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged; and (2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Courier New">Mitigating Conditions: None that are established by the record. (1) The overall criminal conduct (falsifications) remain recent; and (2) the number of falsifications means that the crimes were not an 
isolated incident. In summary, while Applicant has adequately mitigated his financial problems, no such mitigation exists as to his falsifications, under both Guideline E and Guideline.  
Consequently, the evidence compels the conclusion that Applicant has not yet established that he possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of anyone seeking access to the 
nation's secrets.</SPAN></P>
