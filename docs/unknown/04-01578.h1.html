<P>Applicant was involved in an automobile accident and was arrested for aggravated DUI. Applicant knowingly and willfully failed to list the resulting civil suit

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 2 June 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="04-01578.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 19 June 2004 and elected to have his case decided on the record without a hearing. 
DOHA received Applicant's Answer on 7 July 2004. On 25 August 2004, Department Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge under 
Directive &para; E3.1.7. The case was assigned to me on 21 March 2005. On 26 May 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 6 June 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Before traveling to the site of the hearing, I asked Department Counsel for a copy of her request for hearing. She advised she would submit it at the hearing. She 
was unable to produce the document at the hearing, but stated she had asked for the hearing on 25 August 2004. I received a copy of the Request for Hearing, 
dated 25 August 2004, on 10 June 2005. </P> 
<P>"If the applicant has not requested a hearing with his or her answer to the SOR and Department Counsel has not requested a hearing within 20 days of receipt of 
the applicant's answer, the case shall be assigned to the Administrative Judge for a clearance decision based on the written record." Directive &para; E3.1.7.<A HREF="04-01578.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
Department Counsel's request was issued some 49 days after DOHA received Applicant's request that his case be determined on the record without a hearing. 
Applicant did not object to the hearing, and I failed to recognize at the time that Department Counsel's request was not timely. </P> 
<P>The Directive appears to make the filing of Department Counsel's request for a hearing mandatory as there is no provision for an extension of time for good 
cause shown. Therefore, I will not consider the testimony of Department Counsel's witness, the document authenticated by the witness-Ex. 6 (a report of 
investigation), Department Counsel's cross-examination of Applicant, or any argument referencing such testimony or exhibit. This effectively limits the scope 
of information to that which would have been received had this matter been decided without hearing per Direction &para; D3.1.7.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old software test engineer with a defense contractor. He has held a security clearance on three occasions over the past 26 years. </P> 
<P>In July 2000, Applicant went to dinner with his family (wife, children, parents, and sister). He consumed two or three glasses of beer with his dinner. He drove 
home with his son in the rear seat of the vehicle. At about 8:30 p.m., Applicant was involved in an accident a few blocks from his home. The other driver failed 
to yield at a stop sign. Applicant tried to avoid the other vehicle, but struck its rear bumper as he tried to maneuver out of the way. Applicant's car careened off 
the road onto the sidewalk where it hit two pedestrians. When police officers arrived at the scene, they smelled the odor of alcohol on Applicant's breath. An 
officer performed a Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus test on Applicant which, according to the officer, produced four "clues," indicating possible intoxication. No 
other field sobriety tests were performed. They took Applicant and his son to the hospital although neither showed any signs of injury other than a few 
scratches. Because the injuries were minor, the hospital staff did not draw blood for medical reasons. Ex. 4 at 3-5.</P> 
<P>The police asked him for consent to have his blood drawn under the state's implied consent statute. Applicant agreed, and his blood was drawn at 10:35 p.m. A 
police officer then told Applicant he was under arrest for aggravated driving under the influence (DUI),<A HREF="04-01578.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> handcuffed him, advised him of his <EM>Miranda</EM> rights, 
and led him off to the police station where he was photographed, fingerprinted, and released to his wife. </P> 
<P>Analysis of the blood specimen revealed a blood/alcohol level of 0.025%. Ex. 4 at 9. Applicant's attorney told him he had not been arrested.<A HREF="04-01578.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Ex. A at 2.</P> 
<P>On 24 July 2002, one of the pedestrians Applicant's car hit filed a civil suit against Applicant. On 25 July 2004, the suit was dismissed with prejudice after the 
parties had agreed to binding arbitration. The arbitrator concluded that, under all the circumstances of the case, Applicant's conduct did not constitute 
negligence.</P> 
<P>Applicant completed an electronic security clearance application (SCA) on 13 January 2003. Ex. 1. Applicant caused Part II of the SCA to be suppressed. He 
certified the statements contained in the SCA were "true, complete, and correct" to the best of his knowledge and belief, and acknowledged that a "knowing and 
willful false statement" could be punished by fine and/or imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Applicant caused the complete SCA to be transmitted on 15 
January 2003. Ex. 2. Question 21 asked if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense. Question 24 asked if he had been charged with or 
convicted of any offense related to alcohol. Question 26 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any 
offenses not listed previously. Question 40 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been a party to any public record civil court actions not listed 
elsewhere on the form. Applicant answered "no" to each of these questions.</P> 
<P>On 20 August 2003, Applicant submitted a signed, sworn statement to an agent of the Defense Security Service. In his statement, which he declared was "true, 
complete and accurate to the best of [his] knowledge and belief," Applicant described the automobile accident, his arrest, and the subsequent prosecution of the 
other driver. Applicant stated, in part, "I took evasive action to avoid a direct impact, and ended up clipping his right front bumper, which propelled my vehicle 
up the sidewalk curb into a landscape area, where we hit a tree and a rock." Applicant failed to disclose that his vehicle struck two pedestrians on the sidewalk 
or that he was later sued by one of them.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by deliberately failing to note he had been charged with a felony offense (Question 21) 
and an offense related to alcohol (Question 24) (&para; 1.a), and by deliberately failing to list a civil court action (Question 40) (&para; 1.b); and omitted material facts 
from a signed sworn statement to a DSS agent by deliberately failing to note that he had struck pedestrians with his vehicle and that one of the pedestrians had 
sued him (&para; 1.c). Applicant admitted the civil court suit, but denied all allegations he deliberately falsified his SCA or his statement to the DSS agent. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Questions 21 and 24 of the SCA ask if the applicant has ever been "charged with or convicted of" an offense. Question 26<A HREF="04-01578.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> asks if the applicant has been 
"arrested for, charged with, or convicted of an offense." From the additional language in Question 26, we can infer that the drafters did not equate being 
arrested for an offense with being charged with an offense. Instead, it appears the drafters used the term "charged with" to mean the applicant was formally 
charged with an offense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To charge an individual with a felony, there must be an indictment or information. Although it is clear Applicant was arrested for aggravated DUI, there is no 
evidence an indictment or information was ever issued. Thus I conclude there is no evidence Applicant was ever "charged with" a felony as there is no evidence 
an indictment or information was ever issued. Therefore, there is no evidence Applicant answered Question 21 incorrectly or falsely.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To charge an individual with a misdemeanor, many jurisdictions do not require any formal charging document such as an indictment or information. Instead, a 
citation issued by a police officer may be sufficient. There is no admissible evidence of record that Applicant was ever cited for any offense involving alcohol. I 
conclude Applicant did not falsify his answer to Question 24. Therefore, I find for Applicant on &para; 1.a.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established that, more than a year before he completed his SCA, Applicant was sued by one of the pedestrians in the accident and that he 
failed to note this suit in answer to Question 40 on the SCA. He also failed to acknowledge in his signed, sworn statement that his car had hit two pedestrians 
and that one had filed suit against him. Applicant clearly knew his vehicle hit the two pedestrians and that a suit had been filed-he acknowledged being deposed 
by the plaintiff's attorney some seven months before he completed the SCA. Conduct involving the deliberate omission of relevant and material facts from an 
SCA could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying. DC E2.A5.1.2.2. It is also potentially disqualifying for an applicant to deliberately provide false 
or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a security clearance determination. DC E2.A5.1.2.3. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Information is material if it would affect a final agency decision or, if incorrect, would impede a thorough and complete investigation of an applicant's 
background.  ISCR Case No. 01-06870, 2002 WL 32114535 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An applicant's criminal and civil court histories are matters that could 
affect a final agency decision and would impede a thorough investigation of an applicant's background.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits he deliberately omitted information about the law suit from his SCA and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberately failed to notify the DSS agent he had struck pedestrians 
or was sued, but asserts it was not done with fraudulent intent-he did not know the status of his case and his attorney told him not to discuss it.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under all the 
circumstances of the case, I find his explanation unpersuasive. I conclude he deliberately omitted this relevant and material information from his SCA and his 
signed, sworn statement. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only applicable mitigating condition is that Applicant has taken positive steps to reduce his vulnerability to coercion or duress. MC E2.A5.1.3.5. During his 
second interview with the DSS agent, he admitted he struck two pedestrians and that one of them sued him. An applicant may mitigate personal conduct 
security concerns if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily. MC 
E2.A5.1.3.2. As the falsification concerned the current application for security clearance and a statement to the DSS agent investigating Applicant's security 
worthiness, I conclude the falsification was recent. An applicant may also mitigate personal conduct security concerns by proving the omission was caused by 
the improper or inadequate advice of <EM>authorized personnel</EM>. MC E2.A5.1.3.4. There is no evidence any security personnel gave Applicant improper or 
inadequate advice. After considering all of the evidence, I conclude Applicant failed to sufficiently mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. I find 
against Applicant on &para;&para; 1.b and 1.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's deliberate falsifications of his SCA and statement to the DSS agent constituted a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. 
Applicant denied the allegation. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive 
&para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense, punishable by up to five years in jail, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or 
representation or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States.  
18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established that Applicant knowingly and willfully made false statements on his SCA and to the DSS agent. I conclude Applicant violated 18 
U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Such conduct may raise security concerns and is potentially disqualifying as a single serious crime. DC E2.A10.1.2.2. None of the mitigating 
conditions apply. Applicant's criminal conduct was recent-his false statements were on documents used to determine his security worthiness-so MC 
E2.A10.1.3.1 does not apply. As applicant falsified both his SCA and his oral and written statements to the DSS agent, the criminal conduct was not an isolated 
incident, so MC E2.A10.1.3.2 does not apply. I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>
