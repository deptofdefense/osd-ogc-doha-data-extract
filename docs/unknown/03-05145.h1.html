<P>Thirty-six-year-old Applicant has a lifestyle of extravagant spending, periodically interrupted by financial difficulties resulting in obligations being charged off, 
turned over to collection, and two bankruptcies.  Despite having his debts discharged in 2001, and an increased combined monthly income, his financial 
situation continues to deteriorate and he again has accounts that are over the credit limit or past due, and his mortgage payments have been delinquent 
periodically.  He is not currently making any payments towards his student loan, and owes $11,000.00 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unpaid income 
taxes.  Grave questions and doubts remain as to his security eligibility and suitability.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated January 15, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on 
June 7, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 7, 2004, and the hearing was held before me on June 23, 2004.  During the course of the hearing, six 
government exhibits, six Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant) were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
July 22, 2004.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has admitted both of the factual allegations pertaining to financial matters under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to retain the SECRET security clearance previously granted to him.</P> 
<P>Applicant has a lengthy history reflecting outstanding financial obligations that were either charged off, turned over to collection, paid off under a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy, discharged under a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, or remain delinquent.  During the early 1990s, Applicant was working overtime earning a good income 
and buying whatever he wanted.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Credit card companies were showering him with pre-approved credit cards that only served to encourage more spending.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  
The extravagance came to an unexpected halt when the overtime income ceased and Applicant was confronted with an inability to make the required monthly 
payments.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  With no savings, and no way to make payments, in July 1994, Applicant resorted to Chapter 13 bankruptcy.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  At that time, Applicant had 
$15,775.00 total assets compared to $39,576.81 total liabilities.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He eventually paid the Chapter 13 trustee $12,327.40,<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>of which $8,184.21 was paid towards 
creditors' principal, and $1,966.92 was paid towards interest.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The case was completed and the bankruptcy was discharged in June 1998.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  It is unclear if 
Applicant paid off the entire balances due or entered into agreements with the creditors for reduced balances.</P> 
<P>Unfortunately, the cycle returned.  Applicant again started earning more overtime salary and again began spending as he had before.  He married and suddenly 
was confronted with a house payment and utility bills as well as charges for gifts for his wife.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The financial difficulties returned, and, once again, he was 
unable to make the required monthly payments.  Despite his efforts to resolve his delinquent debts, he was unable to do so and, instead, turned once again to 
bankruptcy.  This time, however, he decided to file under Chapter 7, and did so in April 2001.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  At that time, Applicant and his wife had $143,764.00 total 
assets, including a house, compared to $144,233.00 total liabilities, including a mortgage.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In June 2001, Applicant and his wife agreed to reaffirm their debt, 
in the amount of over $18,000.00, for their automobile.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Their remaining debts, primarily credit cards and college tuition, were discharged on August 15, 
2001.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>When Applicant and his wife filed their voluntary petition under Chapter 7 their combined monthly income was $3,456.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Their average monthly expenses 
were $2,684.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  In December 2002, Applicant's wife was no longer working, and his monthly net income was $3,064.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  Their average monthly expenses 
dropped to $1,747.00,<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> and their monthly debts, covering three credit cards, a car payment, and cell phone charges, was $626.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Their available monthly 
funds for discretionary use was $691.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Following their Chapter 7 discharge, Applicant and his wife purchased a new automobile and refinanced their home.</P> 
<P>The cycle has seemingly returned once again.  Applicant currently has accounts that are over the credit limit or past due,<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> and while he has not been delinquent 
in his mortgage payments within the past six months, he has been delinquent periodically since his last bankruptcy.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  He is not currently making any payments 
towards his student loan, and it is unclear if it is in deferment or forbearance.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  He owes $11,000.00 to the IRS for unpaid income taxes for 2001-02, along with 
an unspecified amount for state income taxes,<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> and is presently making monthly payments of $130.00 to the IRS and $60.00 to the state.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  He owns a 2003 
Chevy Malibu,<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> which he financed for $22,000.00,<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>for which he makes monthly payments of $492.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In an effort to pay off his most recent debts, and aware that his security clearance was under scrutiny, in December 2003, he took a second job for which he 
receives approximately $900.00 per month.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  His wife also makes an additional $800.00 per month babysitting.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  He estimates their combined monthly income 
from his two jobs and her one job is about $4,000.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Nevertheless, there is still insufficient funds to make all the necessary monthly payments on his current 
outstanding credit card debt of about $3,200.00.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Applicant has two goals in mind: 1) he wants to pay off the past due and over the limit credit cards by first 
paying off the lowest ones; and 2) he wants to pay all his debts off and cut up his credit cards.</P> 
<P>Applicant has never received any type of consumer credit counseling.<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant is married and has two children.</P> 
<P>Applicant has been employed as a manufacturing technician by the same government contractor, or its successor, since September 1993.  Friends, coworkers, 
and supervisors support his application in glowing terms.  He has been characterized as very respectful, hardworking, accountable, highly skilled, reliable, 
honest, trustworthy, and dedicated to his job and family.</P>

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</P> 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="03-05145.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and 
conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each SOR allegation:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Applicant's lifestyle of extravagant spending is periodically interrupted by financial difficulties 
resulting in obligations being charged off, turned over to collection, and bankruptcy.  In July 1994, when he filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13, his total 
liabilities were $39,576.81.  By June 1998, when the bankruptcy was discharged, his slate was clean.  But not for long.  Without the benefit of any type of 
consumer credit counseling, Applicant resumed his earlier spending habits and the financial difficulties returned.  In April 2001, not quite three years later, 
when he again filed for bankruptcy, this time under Chapter 7, his total liabilities, including his mortgage, had ballooned to $144,233.00.  In August 2001, his 
remaining debts, primarily credit cards and college tuition, were discharged, and once again his slate was clean.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Despite claiming an understanding as to how his financial predicament arose, and declaring an intention not to allow it to occur again, the cycle has seemingly 
returned.  Applicant again has accounts that are over the credit limit or past due, and his mortgage payments have been delinquent periodically since his last 
bankruptcy.  He is not currently making any payments towards his student loan, and owes $11,000.00 to the IRS for unpaid income taxes, along with an 
unspecified amount for state income taxes, for which he is presently making monthly payments.  Symbolic of his lack of financial restraint is his 2003 Chevy 
alibu, which he financed for $22,000.00, for which he makes monthly payments of $492.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon receiving the SOR, and seemingly recognizing the seriousness of his impending financial predicament, Applicant took a second job and his wife has 
started to earn babysitting money.  He estimates their combined monthly income is about $4,000.00.  But it is still insufficient to enable him to make all the 
necessary monthly payments and pay off other accounts.  Thus, his conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial situation and difficulties also bring this matter with Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.6. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  However, the overall impact of that condition is minimized.  He cooperated 
in the eventual payment of debts under Chapter 13 during 1994-98.  He is currently making payments to the IRS and the state for delinquent income tax.  And 
he has finally been motivated by receipt of the SOR to earn more money to address his new financial obligations and delinquencies.  However, in the absence of 
any financial or consumer credit counseling, or something to motivate him to remain current in expenditures and alter his lifestyle of extravagance and fiscal 
irresponsibility, the very recent attempted resolution of Applicant's financial seemingly deteriorating financial condition seems to be more cosmetic than 
meaningful and long-lasting.  Under these circumstances, I believe insufficient time has passed for me to conclude that Applicant has turned his financial life 
and lifestyle around sufficiently for me to be confident that his financial irresponsibility is a thing of the past that will not recur.  Moreover, his persistent 
problem is not, and has never been, primarily the result of conditions beyond his control.  Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case, 
for the evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's continued security eligibility and suitability with respect to his financial 
considerations.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P>
