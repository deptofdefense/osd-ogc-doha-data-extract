<P>Applicant's alcohol abuse has resulted in at least three alcohol-related arrests, the last taking place in November 1999 or 2000.  The Applicant has not abstained 
from drinking and has one failed treatment.  He has been diagnosed as alcohol dependent.  There is a history of three arrests for criminal conduct since 1995.  
Finally, the Applicant falsified a questionnaire with regards to his criminal history.  Adverse inference is not overcome.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 18, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 15, 2003, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN>The Government submitted its 
File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on February 26, 2003.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any 
documents in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on March 10, 2003, and submitted an undated additional statement, 
received by DOHA on April 17, 2003 (Applicant's Exhibit A).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The case was received by the undersigned on April 16, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 39 and single.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Network Administrator, and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance previously 
granted in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits 
and the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol consumption)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses 
intoxicants to excess.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Applicant has abused alcohol for over 20 years.  The Applicant's drinking has resulted in three alcohol related arrests for Driving Under the Influence 
(DUI).  One in 1980, another in 1998 and the last in November 1999 or 2000. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first arrest occurred in approximately December 1980, when the Applicant was a juvenile.  He admitted this arrest in his 1989 Personnel Security 
Questionnaire.  (Item 5 at Question 21.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges in subparagraph 1.g. that the Applicant was again arrested for Driving Under the Influence in 1988.  This appears to be a typographical error.  
In his Interrogatories (Item 9 at question 5), he states, "June, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">1998</SPAN> - DUI - Fine and weekend intervention program."  In addition, the adjudged punishment, 
including the weekend intervention program, is the same as that for the January 1999 arrest for DUI (SOR 1.c., 1.d. and 1.e.).  In accordance with paragraph 
E3.1.17 of the Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive, I am amending subparagraph 1.g. of the SOR to read 1998, vice 1988.  </SPAN>In his sworn statement 
of April 19, 2000, the Applicant states,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"I have been abusing alcohol since I was 18 years old.  And I got a DUI in Jan 98.  </SPAN>I have been in AA since the DUI and 
have not had a drink since."  (Item 7 at 1.) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I further find that the January 1998, June 1998 and January 1999 incidents referred to by the Applicant and the 
Government are the same event or course of events.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding the second arrest, the Applicant denied that he twice failed to participate in the alcohol intervention programs, as alleged in SOR 1.e.  Rather, he 
states, "The intervention program nurse twice sent me home after I had reported because my blood pressure was too high.  They did not notify the courts of this 
as they had said they would so a bench warrant was issued but never enforced."  (Applicant's Answer.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was assessed in the weekend intervention program in October 1999.  He was given an assessment of "Alcohol Dependence-Severe Condition."  
(Item 11 at 8.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's Interrogatories (Item 9 at 7) also show that there was a third DUI in approximately November 1999 (SOR 1.f.).  The Applicant admits this 
arrest, but states in his Answer that it occurred in November 2000.  As a result of this last conviction he was fined and served ten days in an adult detention 
center.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant states in his Answer that it was in April 2001, not April 2000 as alleged in SOR 1.b., that he attended a 30 day alcohol treatment program. The 
Applicant further states in his Answer that he, "did not complete it [the program] because I felt I didn't belong there."  Once again, the facts concerning the 
dates of this treatment came from the Applicant's Interrogatories, which he filled out.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits that he continues to drink 3 or 4 beers a week, usually on the weekends. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's three admitted arrests for DUI will be evaluated under this paragraph as well.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits that he was arrested in 1995 for passing a bad check for approximately $170.  He plead guilty and, having already paid the bounced 
check, had his fine waived.  (Item 6 at 2 and Item 13.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant denied SOR 2.c., which alleges that he received Non-Judicial Punishment in 1984 for seven specifications of failing to report to his place of 
duty.  The military records in the file, Item 14 at 3, are virtually illegible, making it impossible to determine the facts of this subparagraph.  This allegation will 
be found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant did admit receiving Non-Judicial Punishment in 1983 for failing to report to his place of duty.  (SOR 2.d.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 17, 1999, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that he had been arrested once for an alcohol-related offense, in 
January 1999.  (Item 3, question 24.)  This was a false answer.  In fact, the Applicant had been arrested in 1980 while a juvenile, as set forth under Paragraph 1, 
above.  Another arrest occurred in either November 1999 or November 2000.  In either case, the last event had not yet happened when the Applicant submitted 
the questionnaire. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the same questionnaire, the Applicant was asked, "In the last 7 years has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?"  (Item 3, question 30.)  The Applicant answered no because, at the time of the 
questionnaire, he had been ordered to attend the weekend intervention program set forth in SOR 1.d. and 1.g., but had not yet done so.  While it might have 
been better if the Applicant had been totally forthcoming with the Government, his answer was technically correct.  This allegation is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was also asked in the same questionnaire whether there were any other arrests or charges in the last seven years that he had not otherwise 
discussed on the form.  (Item 3, question 26.)  The Applicant said, "No."  This was a false answer, since the Applicant had been charged with  Passing a Bad 
Check in 1995.  (Item 13.)  In his statement of April 19, 2000, the Applicant states, "I forgot to list the bad check charge on the security report.  I had listed 
them on a security report in 1997 but the investigation was cancelled when my company lost the contract they were bidding.  I was not trying to keep this 
information from anyone or hide anything."  (Item 7 at 2.)  Regarding the same offense, the Applicant said in November 1996, "I did not list this arrest [SOR 
2.b.] on my security paperwork because I was ashamed it happened and did not want anyone to know about it.  No one I work with knows about the arrest.  My 
parents do not know about this and I definitely do not want them to find out.  My father takes great pride in hard work and responsibility, and he has never had a 
past due debt.  Only my wife and in-laws know about the arrest."  (Item 6 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is the primary provider of the facts in this case.  He has given several statements, filled out several questionnaires, a set of Interrogatories and an 
Answer.  All are contradictory in terms of the Applicant's drinking and criminal histories.  These inconsistent responses seriously affect my view of the 
Applicant's credibility. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding his drinking past, the Applicant says:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1998, after a 15 year marriage, I went through a long and painful divorce.  I was very depressed for a long time.  Now I am in a great relationship with a 
wonderful woman.  We rent a house together and I feel much better about myself and everything in general.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I don't drink anything stronger than beer and only once a week at the most.  I do not drink to the point of intoxication.  I had some rough times but I now 
believe I have my life back in order.  (Item 9 at 7.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol abuse;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who sis a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</P> 
 
<P>a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P>c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e. The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g. The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </P> 
 
<P>The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse, criminal conduct and falsification that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on 
the Applicant's part.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G); that he 
engaged in several criminal acts (Guideline J); and that he has intentionally made false material statements to DoD, in violation of a felony criminal statute 
(Guidelines E and J).</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.  Under Paragraph 2 (Guideline J), as set forth above, subparagraph 2.c. is found for the Applicant as the 
evidence presented was no sufficient to prove the allegation.  Subparagraph 2.d. is found for the Applicant because the offense charged was strictly military in 
nature, it occurred 20 years ago, and has no current security significance.  Regarding Paragraph 3 (Guideline E), Subparagraph 3.b. is found for the Applicant as 
I have determined that the Applicant's answer was true at the time of the questionnaire, and therefore there was no falsification.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's alcohol use has, by his admission, been considerably reduced in the past two years.  The Applicant argues that his last two alcohol-related incidents 
were due, in part, to his marital difficulties.  However, there is a lack of evidence in the file to support his argument.  Given that his last DUI was either in 1999 
or 2000, I cannot find that the Applicant has met his burden in showing that he has mitigated his long-term alcohol problem.  Paragraph 1 and all its 
subparagraphs are found against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P> Applicant has been arrested three times in the last eight years.  There is some evidence in the file, primarily from the Applicant, that he has reformed and that 
his criminal conduct is in the past.  However, with the lack of outside evidence to support the Applicant's unsupported statements, I cannot find that he has 
mitigated this allegation.  Subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b., along with Paragraph 2, are found against the Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  With regards to Subparagraphs 3.a. and 3.c., 
there is no argument that the Applicant left out arrests that should have been admitted.  There is also evidence, particularly with regard to the arrest in 3.c., that 
the Applicant had motive to withhold the information.  There is evidence that the Government had notice of these arrests in prior questionnaires and statements.  
However, the Personnel Security Questionnaire is the essential element in determining security worthiness.  Each one should be viewed in isolation.  Looked at 
in that perspective, the Applicant was not truthful.  In these cases, once the Government shows that the answers are false, the Applicant has to provide 
compelling evidence that there was no intent to deceive.  Looking at the evidence as a whole, in my opinion, he has not met that burden.  Guidelines E and J are 
found against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's efforts at reform are noted.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, this evidence does not overcome the adverse information that has 
been presented by the Government.</P> 
 
<P>On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons. </P>
