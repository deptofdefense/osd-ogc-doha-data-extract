<P>Applicant's abuse of marijuana from 1977 to December 2002, and cocaine from 1977 to January 2000, was not mitigated where Applicant's statements of 
intent to refrain from drug use in the future were not credible, given that he resumed drug abuse when his clearance was terminated in 1995 and his current 
willingness to refrain was conditioned on obtaining his clearance. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 10 June 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of illegal drug use<A HREF="04-08823.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>. He answered the SOR 6 July 2005, and requested a decision without hearing. He did not respond to DOHA's 28 
September 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 2 November 2005, when his response was due. DOHA assigned the case to me 28 
November 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for subparagraphs 1.e., 1.g., and 1.h.;<A HREF="04-08823.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> accordingly, I incorporate the admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 45-year-old sales engineer employed by the same defense contractor since August 1985--seeks access to classified information. He reports 
having held a clearance from 1988 to 1995.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed his most-recent clearance application in September 2003, he reported use of cocaine and marijuana within the last seven years 
(question 27). He reported using cocaine 25 times between January 1980 and January 2000. He reported using marijuana "many" times between January 1978 
and December 2002. He denied having used drugs while possessing a security clearance (question 28). In a November 2003 sworn statement, he briefly 
described his recent drug use, referred to past drug use he disclosed during a background investigation in 1988, and reiterated that he did not use any illegal 
drugs while he held a clearance between 1988 and 1995. He stated "I have no intention of further usage of illegal drugs," and explained that he did not plan on 
using drugs again and offered that he was "pretty stupid doing this again at this age of my life."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for a clearance in late 1987 or early 1988, he apparently omitted his drug use from 1977 to 1988 from his application. He made two 
sworn statements in May 1988 in which he described regular use of marijuana from 1977 to 1985, and somewhat less regular use of  cocaine during the same 
dates. He attributed his initial drug use to curiosity and his continued drug use to peer pressure. He insisted that he stopped using illegal drugs in 1985 because 
of his job and  its attendant responsibility. He described his career as the most important thing to him and stated he had "no future intent to use marijuana or 
cocaine or any other type of illegal drug." He denied falsifying his clearance application and explained the omission of his drug history variously as "no current 
usage" or "no current usage for 3 years." Based on these representations, Applicant was apparently granted his clearance in May 1988.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer, Applicant admits to using marijuana from 1977 to 1988, and from 1995 to December 2002. He admits to using marijuana after his 1988 
statement that he would not use drugs in the future. He specifically denies using cocaine at any time while he held a clearance, and later insists that he used no 
illegal drugs while holding a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline H (Drug Involvement).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-08823.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline H, and the Applicant has not mitigated the conduct. Applicant was a recreational user of marijuana 
from approximately 1977 to at least December 2002, and a recreational user of cocaine from 1977 to at least January 2000.<A HREF="04-08823.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Clearly, the illegality of the conduct 
did not affect Applicant's decision to use marijuana and cocaine. Nor did Applicant show any concern for his employer and any drug policy it might have.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has made inconsistent statements regarding the nature and extent of his drug use, both during his 1988 background investigation and the current one. 
He has admitted marijuana abuse to at least 1988--the date his clearance was first granted--but stated in 1988 that he had stopped in 1985--his stated reason 
for not disclosing his drug abuse on his first clearance application. However, his stated cessation date of 1985 coincides with his employment date with his 
current employer. Similarly, his 2003 clearance application reports marijuana use from 1978 to 2002 and cocaine use from 1980 to 2000, neither report 
reserving any periods of non-use. Yet his November 2003 sworn statement insists--as he has since--that he used no drugs while he had a clearance between 
1988 and 1995.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have no records confirming that Applicant had no clearance from 1988 to 1995. But I do have his admission that he used drugs from 1985 to 1988 and from 
1995 to 2000/2002, all while employed by the same employer. Although the record is silent, it is beyond the realm of credibility that the employer has a drug 
policy that tolerates illegal drug abuse. In truth, I find Applicant's claims that he was drug free while he held a clearance less than credible on this record, but I 
will not engage in speculation. However, I can conclude that he has not proved to my satisfaction that he was drug free during that time.  Nevertheless, even if I 
concluded that Applicant had remained drug free while holding a clearance the last time, I would not find him eligible for a clearance today. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating conditions for drug involvement. His drug use is recent, ending--at best nine months before he reapplied for his 
clearance.<A HREF="04-08823.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> His drug use was not isolated or aberrational.<A HREF="04-08823.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He has not demonstrated an intent to refrain from drug use in the future.<A HREF="04-08823.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant now vows--as he 
did in 1988--to refrain from illegal drug abuse. To his credit, he does not offer protestations that he has seen the virtue of remaining drug-free in the future 
because of the importance of his job, as he did in 1988. He candidly promises only to remain drug-free during any period of time he holds a clearance. This is 
insufficient to demonstrate an intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future. Demonstrated intent is not a coat to be put on when one applies for a clearance and 
taken off again any time a clearance is no longer required. Further, Applicant does not grasp the concept that when he resumed drug abuse in 1995, he put the 
classified information that he had acquired from 1988 to 1995 potentially at risk, just as he clearly implies he would put the classified information he would 
have access to in the future at risk once he no longer required a clearance. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H. against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
