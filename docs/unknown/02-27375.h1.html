<P>Applicant, who is a U.S. naturalized citizen and was a citizen of Honduras solely by virtue of his birth and his parents' birth in the country, mitigates security 
concerns associated with his past dual citizenship with Honduras and the U.S. by surrendering his expired Honduran passport, renouncing his Honduran 
citizenship, and demonstrating his property interests in Honduras derive only beneficially from his wife's Honduran legal and equitable interest in her home.  
Because Applicant's immediate and extended family members who reside in Honduras are shown to pose no discernible vulnerability to pressure or coercion, 
foreign influence concerns are also mitigated.  Applicant successfully refutes allegations of falsification of his security clearance.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on March 23, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing 
on December 7,  2004.  A hearing was convened on December 7, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on two 
witnesses (including himself) and nine exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on December 17, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Department Counsel requested official notice be taken of a  U.S. State Department consular information sheet covering 
Honduras.  There being no objection from Applicant, and good cause being shown, official notice was taken of the State Department document.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR to add subparagraph 1.e to allege Applicant possesses a foreign passport.  There 
being no objection from Applicant, and good cause being demonstrated, the Government's amendment motion was granted.  Applicant admitted the new 
allegation and committed to surrendering his Honduran passport and renouncing his Honduran citizenship.  He added his explanation that he was told by a U.S. 
immigration official that he could keep his Honduran passport as a souvenir.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record remain open to permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of his 
surrender of his expired Honduran passport and renunciation of his Honduran citizenship.  There being no objection from the Government, and good cause 
being demonstrated, Applicant was granted 15 days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn, was afforded five days to respond.  Within the time 
permitted, Applicant furnished a copy of a cover letter from applicant's counsel with an accompanying letter from the Honduran consulate confirming 
Applicant's surrendering his Honduran passport and Applicant's affidavit of December 14, 2004 confirming his surrender of his Honduran passport and 
renunciation of his Honduran citizenship.  Applicant's submissions were accepted as Applicant's exhibits J and K, respectively.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to have a preference for Honduras, manifested by the following: (1) He owns a home in Honduras, from which he 
receives rental income; (2) he invests all of his Honduras rental income in a Honduras cooperative company, and (3) he intends to reside in his Honduras home 
after he retires.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to (a) have a mother and five siblings who are citizens and residents of Honduras; (b) he maintains telephone contact 
with his mother and siblings; &copy;) he provides $100.00 to $200.00 every three months to his mother in Honduras; (e) he traveled to Honduras from July 1998 to 
August 1998 and from June 2002 to July 2002 to visit his relatives, and (f) he owns a home in Honduras, from which he earns rental income,  and intends to 
retire there. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E; Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of December 2000 by failing to list his five siblings and his 
foreign property when responding to questions 9 and 17 (<EM>sic</EM>) of the questionnaire.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations under Guidelines B and C, denying only his investing all of his Honduran property 
income in a cooperative (claiming his wife does the investing, not himself).  He also denied deliberately falsifying his SF-86.  He claimed no current investment 
income from his house in Honduras.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant 
are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Born and raised in Honduras in 1959, Applicant played soccer in his youth but never served in the Honduran military (R.T., at 64).  He married his spouse (W), 
of Austrian descent, in 1980.  They have three children from their marriage, ages 24, 21 and 17, respectively.   He emigrated to the U.S. in 1992 with his wife 
and children to be close to her father who was already naturalized as a U.S. citizen and living in the U.S..  Applicant himself became a naturalized U.S. citizen 
in October 1997 and never used his Honduras passport (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3) thereafter to travel to Honduras or any other country.  He believed at the time he was 
renouncing his Honduran citizenship by becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen.  However, he neither formally renounced his Honduran citizenship nor 
surrendered his expired Honduran passport at the time.  Rather,  he retained his Honduras passport as a family souvenir, which a U.S. immigration official 
indicated he could lawfully do (<EM>see</EM> ex. K).  To avoid any confusion over whether he could retain his Honduran passport (which subsequently expired in 2001) 
without jeopardizing his security clearance, he went to the local Honduran Consulate in December 2004, where he surrendered his Honduras passport and 
formally renounced his Honduran citizenship (ex. K).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owns land in Honduras which his mother financed for him in 2002. With the 500 lempiras (about $38.00) his mother gave him, he purchased the land 
with his brothers (<EM>see</EM> C; R.T., at 28-29, 64-65).  Applicant does not know how much the land has since appreciated.  The home in Honduras that he admits to 
having an interest in is actually W's.  W rents the home and currently places the rental income in a local Honduran bank account (<EM>see</EM> ex. I), which is not an 
investment company.  Applicant's cooperative investment account where W previously deposited some of her rental income has since been closed (R.T., at 33).  
Since closing his cooperative account, W gives what is left of the monthly rental income after the mortgage to Applicant who deposits it in a local Honduran 
bank account (R.T., at 33-34, 88-92, 103-04).  While Applicant claims a customary interest in the home as W's spouse (something he can do under Honduran 
law as the husband of a Honduran property owner), he does not consider himself the legal owner of the house and makes no financial decisions about the home 
(R.T., at 32-33, 61-62).  W corroborates Applicant in assuring  she is the sole legal and equitable owner of the Honduras home (R.T., at 88-92).  Her assurances 
are accepted.  Although Applicant derives indirect financial benefit from his wife's property, he does not have an interest in the home that can be characterized 
as either a legal or equitable share under Honduran law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant owns a home in the U.S. (<EM>see</EM> exs. D and E) and maintains two bank accounts and a 401(k) retirement account in the U.S. as well (<EM>see</EM> exs. F and G).  
His children (all U.S. citizens by birth) have attended public schools in the US.  He is the recipient of a certificate of good conduct from his local police 
department, documenting his lack of any problems with local law enforcement (<EM>see</EM> ex. A; R.T., at 21).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides his mother who is a citizen and resident of Honduras, Applicant has four brothers and six sisters who are each citizens and residents of Honduras (R.T., 
at 51-52).  His father and one sister have since passed away.  Neither his mother nor any of his siblings have ever served in the Honduras military.  None of 
them have ever worked for the Honduras Government or any of its affiliations, and none have ever had any involvement or interest in Honduran politics (R.T., 
at 51-52).  Applicant last visited his family in Honduras approximately two years ago.  He and his wife send his mother and siblings $200.00 or less every 
month to help sustain them (R.T., at 23-24, 54-55, 88). He maintains monthly contact with his mother and siblings, who in Applicants's opinion are at no risk to 
being pressured, influenced, or coerced by Honduran authorities to enlist disclosures of classified information from Applicant. W's father passed away about 
three years ago.  However, she has a brother who is a dual U.S.-Honduran citizen and splits his time between the U.S. and Honduras; she has little contact with 
her brother and his wife (R.T., at 96).  W also has a mother, who is a Honduran citizen who resides in the U.S. (R.T., at 97).    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1997, Applicant has visited Honduras three times (last in 2002 with W and his three children), each time using his 
U.S. passport.  He has never used his Honduran passport since becoming a U.S. citizen.  When he retires, he intends to split his time between Honduras and the 
U.S., but not permanently retire to W's home in Honduras as claimed by the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the information furnished in the U.S. State Department's consular sheet, Honduras  is a democratic country with a developing economy.  For 
Honduran-born citizens like Applicant who have become U.S. citizens, they retain their Honduran citizenship as dual nationals unless and until they formal step 
to renounce their Honduran citizenship (<EM>see</EM> <EM>U.S. State Department Consular Information Sheet of November 2004).  </EM>Security concerns inside Honduras remain 
considerable due to high crime rates and limited law enforcement resources. Considerable caution is recommended for  traveling U.S. citizens.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked to complete an SF-86 in December 2000, Applicant omitted the names of his siblings living in Honduras and the home his wife owns in Honduras (s<EM>ee</EM> 
ex. 1).  Applicant attributes his omissions to his confusion over the electronic  framing of the question, stemming from his language barriers (R.T., at 38-39).  
He cites his previous identification of his siblings on a company insurance application as indicative of his lack of any intent to deliberately withhold information 
about his siblings in Honduras (R.T., at 38, 60-61).  And he attributes  his omission of the Honduran home he claims a customary interest in to his belief that he 
does not have either a legal or equitable interest in his wife's home (R.T., at 42-43, 61-62).  Assessing the credibility of Applicant's claims in light of his 
exhibited demeanor, corroborative support from his wife, and surrounding circumstances, inferences warrant that Applicant did not knowingly and wilfully 
omit information about his siblings and W's property when answering questions 9 and 17 (not 12 as alleged in the SOR) of his Sf-86. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to 
provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern: </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or are obligation <EM>are not</EM> citizens of the United States <EM>or may </EM>be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for 
the purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a conscientious member of  a defense contractor who after being born and raised in Honduras, emigrated to the U.S. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in 1992 to join his father-in-law (already a naturalized US citizen) and seek better economic opportunities.  One in the US, he and his wife had three children together and became 
naturalized US citizens.  Both Applicant and his wife have immediate family members who are citizens and residents of Honduras, and with whom they 
maintain mostly regular contact (with the exception of W's brother).  Believing he had implicitly renounced his Honduran citizenship when he swore allegiance 
to the US, he opted at the time to keep his Honduran passport (which expired in 2001) as a souvenir and forego formal renunciation of his Honduran 
citizenship. He has since surrendered his expired Honduran passport and renounced his Honduran citizenship. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Dual citizenship concerns necessarily entail country allegiance assessments and invite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the 
interests of the foreign country over the interests of the U.S.  In a different vein, the continued residence of Applicant's immediate family members (his mother 
and ten brothers and sisters) and his wife's brother in Honduras raises potential concerns about their being vulnerable to future pressure or duress that could 
result in the compromise of classified information.  The issues, as such, raise concerns over Applicant's  preference for a foreign country over the U.S. and the 
potential for members of Applicant's immediate and extended family being placed at risk to pressure, duress, or influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of his birth in Honduras to parents of Honduran descent and citizenship, Applicant was endowed with Honduran citizenship through his parents. What 
is clear from a review of the State Department's Consular Information sheet of November 2004 is that a Honduran-born citizen's becoming a naturalized citizen 
of another country does not automatically deprive the Honduran citizen of his Honduran citizenship.  By taking citizenship in another country (such as the U.S.) 
the Honduran-born citizen becomes a dual citizen of both countries.  In this respect, Honduras' practice is consistent with the practices of many countries who 
(like Honduras) do not recognize an oath of allegiance to another country (such as the U.S.) as implicit renunciation of the person's Honduras citizenship.  This 
lack of uniformity in the handling of citizenship issues by nation states was duly noted by the Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 02-06806 (February 25, 2003) 
and in ISCR Case No. 00-0516 (December 7, 2001).  By taking express action to renounce his Honduran citizenship, Applicant absolved himself of any 
continuing concerns associated with his holding dual citizenship.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant has never used his Honduran passport (which expired in 1997) after becoming a naturalized US citizen, he retained it in his possession until 
recently.  Such continued possession, even without use and/or expiration (as here), has been considered by the Appeal Board to violate the <EM>per se </EM>bar of DoD's 
August 2000 memorandum concerning foreign passports (<EM>hereinafter </EM>"ASDC3I memorandum).  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-06174 (February 28, 205); ISCR Case 
No. 01-01295 (December 13, 2001).   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Risks of his being taken hostage behind Honduran lines and denied the customary diplomatic intercession made available 
to U.S. citizens traveling on US passports is the generally accorded rationale for insisting on the traveler's use of a US passport when traveling abroad.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, while Applicant's limited exercise of dual citizenship by holding on to his Honduran passport is sufficient to invoke Disqualifying Condition (DC) 
E2.A3.1.2 (<EM>Possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for foreign preference, his avoiding any use of his Honduran passport 
after becoming a U.S. citizen and now surrendering the expired passport to the Honduran consulate mitigates this foreign passport security concern.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other preference concerns manifest in Applicant's claimed ownership of foreign real estate and investment accounts in Honduras and declared intent to retire in 
W's Honduran home are sufficiently refuted to preclude any application of disqualifying conditions pertinent to using foreign citizenship to protect financial or 
business interests in another country.  Further, Applicant mitigates any residual foreign preference concerns by demonstrating (a) his dual citizenship with 
Honduras was solely by virtue of his parents' citizenship in Honduras and (b) he has since surrendered his expired Honduran passport and renounced his 
Honduran citizenship.  Applicant may take advantage, accordingly, of two of the mitigating conditions for foreign preference: E2.A3.1.3.1 (<EM>Dual citizenship is 
based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country</EM>) and E2.A3.1.3.4 <EM>(Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship</EM>).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's dual citizenship exercise and  meaningful mitigation efforts, conclusions warrant that Applicant's 
exhibited active dual citizenship by his retaining his Honduran passport after becoming a naturalized US citizen, expressing a customary interest in his wife's 
Honduran home, and indicating interest in retiring in W's Honduran home are mitigated.   By mitigating the Government's preference concerns, Applicant 
demonstrates his continued preference for the US since becoming a naturalized US citizen.  Applicant's demonstrated preference for the US satisfies his burden 
requirements in successfully discounting the Government's claimed  security risks.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 
1.e of Guideline C. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides foreign preference concerns, Government finds security risks associated with (a) Applicant's (a) beneficial property interest in a Honduran home from 
which he and his wife receive income in his wife's name, (b) his regular contacts with his family members residing in Honduras, and &copy;) his expressed intent to 
reside part of the time in their Honduran home after he retires. Although Applicant's ties to his wife's brother do not appear to be particularly close, his 
connections with his mother and siblings are quite close and  invite application of Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (<EM>An immediate family member, or 
person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) and E2.A2.1.2.8 (<EM>A 
substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign owned or operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence</EM>) of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines for foreign influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate <EM>per se</EM> results or mandate particular outcomes for any chosen set of guidelines 
covering risks of foreign influence.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases 
must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing.  Personnel security assessments continue to be 
governed by the same Change 4 requirements of the Directive for appraising the security risks associated with the individual's having family abroad, which 
include both common sense assessments of country risks and information available from public sources.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So, under these adjudicative guidelines, while an applicant with immediate family domiciled in a hypothetical hostile country might pose a risk of a hostage 
situation, he might conversely be able to neutralize material risks of exploitation of immediate and/or extended family members residing in a friendly country.  
While Honduras cannot be characterized as a particularly close ally of the US, it is not described in State Department official publications as hostile either: It is 
characterized as  a functioning democracy with a developing economy.  Based on reported criminal activities in the country alone, Honduras cannot be 
considered a country with a political hierarchy unfriendly to the U.S. and a risk to hostage taking.  Under such circumstances, Applicant's immediate and 
extended family members are not exploitation risks under the conditions and criteria included in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the foreign influence provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines are ostensibly neutral as to the character of the subject country, they should not be 
construed to ignore the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved.  Honduras is a constitutional republic, governed by executive 
and legislative branches whose leadership and influence are directed and circumscribed by secular tenets that confirm the place of the rule of law in the 
Government's institutional hierarchy.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because Honduras remains a transitioning democracy that lacks a secure infrastructure and track record for ensuring the safety of foreigners traveling in the 
country, the risk of a pressure or influence situation involving an immediate or extended family member of Applicant's cannot be completely discounted.  
However, any residual security concerns arising out of Applicant's having family and property interests in Honduras are sufficiently mitigated by Applicant's 
demonstrated U.S. preference and strong ties to the U.S. to permit safe predictive judgments about his ability to withstand risks of exploitation and pressure 
attributable to his familial relationships and contacts with his immediate and extended family members domiciled  in Honduras.  Favorable conclusions warrant 
with respect to subparagraphs 2.a through 2.f of Guideline B. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concerns as well are Applicant's omissions of his siblings and foreign property interests in Honduras in his completed December 2000 
SF-86.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His omissions, however, are attributable to his mistaken reading of question 9 and his accepted belief that his beneficial interest in his wife's Honduras 
home and rental income entitlement didn't rise to the level of a legal interest in foreign property that needed reporting.  Applicant's explanations of his 
omissions were persuasive enough to avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission and enable him to refute the allegations of falsification governed by 
Guideline E. </SPAN></P>
