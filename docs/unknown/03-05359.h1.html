<P>Applicant was granted a security clearance in October 2001 when he was 26-years-old. In March 2002, less than five months later, Applicant used marijuana 
after drinking an excessive amount of alcohol. Applicant has failed to meet his heavy burden of persuasion under both the drug involvement guideline and the 
whole person concept because: (1) he used drugs while holding a security clearance; and, (2) he was involved in the same kind of unalleged behavior in May 
1998 even though he had no security clearance at the time. Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 30, 2003 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, amended April 4, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's undated answer to the SOR was received on May 21, 2003. Applicant elected to have his case decided on a written record. The Government 
provided Applicant a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 16, 2003. Applicant received the FORM on October 28, 2003. His one-page 
response was received by me for decision on November 25, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges drug involvement. Applicant admitted subparagraph 1.a. of the SOR. Applicant's admission shall be incorporated in the following findings of 
fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 28-years-old and employed as a network engineer by a defense contractor. He seeks a secret level clearance. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement</SPAN></STRONG>. While on vacation in March 2002, Applicant, who was then 26-years-old, attended a car race with a group of friends. During their lodging 
at nearby campgrounds, someone in the group passed around a water bong containing marijuana. After drinking about 12 beers during that day and evening, 
Applicant took a drag from the bong and began coughing and feeling sleepy. Applicant stated, "[I] did it because it felt like the right thing to do at the time." 
(Item 5) Applicant also stated he had not paid for the marijuana or purchased any. Then Applicant explained he had not used any drugs in the last seven years 
and did not intend to use any drugs in the future. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was involved in similar unalleged behavior in May 1998, but the drug was alcohol. According to his sworn statement dated September 30, 1999, 
Applicant (who was 22-years-old) got involved in a car accident after drinking at bars with friends after work. He was arrested for driving while intoxicated 
(DWI) after failing a field sobriety test. According to a computerized printout of court records (Item 6), Applicant was granted probation before judgment, 
dependent on completion of four conditions. Those conditions included: (1) 30 hours of community service; (2) submit to alcohol and drug evaluation; (3) do 
not drive after consuming alcohol; (4) enroll in a treatment program; and, (4) attend victim impact meetings. Applicant completed all terms of probation on 
June 16, 2000. </P> 
 
<P>Before the May 1998 arrest for DWI, Applicant had been drinking on the weekends only, becoming intoxicated once a month after consuming approximately 9 
or 10 beers. After the May 1998 arrest, Applicant curtailed his drinking to three or four beers once a month, and stated his intention not to drink and drive again.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Character Evidence</SPAN></STRONG>. Applicant has been a network engineer since September 1999. In his response to the FORM, Applicant explained he owns a home and 
plans to marry in June 2004. He also has an excellent performance record with his current employer. In addition, he drinks occasionally at home but no longer 
frequents bars or drives while drinking. Even though Applicant attributes his May 1998 DWI to a "single-lifestyle activity," the March 2002 incident involving 
the marijuana smoking device also represents a "single-lifestyle activity" less than two years removed, that occurred after he received his Department of 
Defense security clearance in October 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that must be given binding consideration in making 
security clearance decisions. These conditions must be considered in every case according to the pertinent guideline; however, the conditions are in no way 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">automatically</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">determinative</SPAN> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. Because each 
security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the conditions exhaust the entire realm of human experience or that 
the conditions apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Conditions 
most pertinent to evaluation of the facts in this case are:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions (DC):</P> 
 
<P>1. Any drug abuse;</P> 
 
<P>2. Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution.</P> 
 
<P>5. Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariably result 
in an unfavorable determination.</P> 
 
<P>Mitigating Conditions (MC):</P> 
 
<P>1. The drug involvement was not recent;</P> 
 
<P>2. The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational incident;</P> 
 
<P>3. A demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at pages 16 
and 17of Enclosure 2 of the Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and 
(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of a security clearance under 
this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, 
careful consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information 
in the future. The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P> 
 
<P>The Government must establish a <EM>prima facie</EM> case under drug involvement (Guideline H) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation, or extenuation that demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Department of Defense (DoD) prohibits drug use by security clearance holders because drug use is against the law and also impairs social and occupational 
functioning. If an individual chooses to break the law by using drugs while possessing a security clearance, he demonstrates poor judgment that may warrant the 
removal of his security clearance. When Applicant was 26-years-old in October 2001, he was granted a security clearance. In March 2002, he used marijuana 
after consuming about 12 beers. Even though the drug use occurred only once and occurred away from work, it is disqualifying under DC 1. The drug use is 
also disqualifying under DC 2 since Applicant was in possession of the marijuana he smoked in March 2002. Finally, Applicant's drug use is disqualifying 
under DC 5 because it constitutes recent drug involvement following the granting of a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In response to the <EM>prima facie</EM> case that has been established under the drug involvement guideline, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information. MC 1 is available to mitigate drug involvement when the 
involvement was not recent. MC 1 is not applicable because the drug use was recent, having occurred in March 2002. </P> 
 
<P>Although the record reflects Applicant only used the drug on one occasion in March 2002, that use must be weighed in light of the other evidence indicating 
excessive alcohol use during the entire day. In sum, Applicant receives only limited mitigation under MC 2.</P> 
 
<P>MC 5 may mitigate past drug use when the individual has demonstrated an intent not to use drugs in the future. Satisfying the condition begins with a statement 
of intention not to use drugs in the future. However, the individual must demonstrate his intention with evidence that facilitates or promotes a drug-free 
lifestyle. Though Applicant has stated he has a settled lifestyle, he has not furnished any evidence to support that claim. While Applicant stresses excellent 
performance evaluations at work, he has offered no independent evidence to support his claim. In sum, I am unable to find that Applicant has satisfied MC 5 
and the drug involvement guideline. </P> 
 
<P>I reach the same conclusion after weighing and balancing the circumstances of this case under the whole person concept. While the marijuana use occurred only 
once in March 2002, it occurred when Applicant was 26 years old and felt the drug use was appropriate after consuming 12 beers. Because this same kind of 
excessive alcohol use resulted in the car accident and a DWI in May 1998, Applicant's uncorroborated claim he will not use drugs in the future is insufficient 
for me to find for him under the whole person concept.</P>
