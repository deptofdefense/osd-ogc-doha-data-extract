<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On January 10, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  
On February 17, 2006, after considering the record,  Administrative Judge Jacqueline T. Williams denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  
Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.<A HREF="03-22679.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  It only contains new evidence in the form of documents showing 
that Applicant has paid off, or is making regular payments on, his outstanding debts.  Much of the documentation predates the adverse determination in his case, 
but the Applicant states that he did not provide it in response to the government's file of relevant material because he thought credible proof had been provided 
to the Defense Security Service during his background investigation.<A HREF="03-22679.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Board cannot consider this new evidence on appeal.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Administrative Judge committed harmful error.  
Applicant has not made an allegation of harmful error.<A HREF="03-22679.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is 
AFFIRMED.</SPAN></P>
