<P>After Applicant left the Army, he accumulated considerable debt due to expenses incurred with going to school and expenses for his family. In January 2004, 
Applicant obtained a new job. Since that time he has made substantial efforts to resolve all of his debts. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 9 June 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision<A HREF="04-02702.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. 
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 18 July 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 10 
August 2005. A hearing was scheduled for 28 September 2005, but had to be rescheduled due to Hurricane Rita. I convened a hearing on 19 October 2005 to 
consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.) on 1 November 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old field support engineer working on communications systems for a defense contractor. Since 1986, he has been associated with the 
U.S. Army as either an active duty or reserve member. From February 2004-February 2005, Applicant served his employer in Iraq. He is married and has three 
children by his two previous wives.</P> 
<P>Applicant made some major mistakes when he got out of the Army. He attended school and was unable to meet all of his expenses and child support 
obligations. Due to poor planning, and pride in not asking help from his family and friends, he became mired in debt.</P> 
<P>Since graduating from college and acquiring his present position, Applicant has made significant efforts in reforming his financial situation and paying off all of 
his debts.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant has a 1998 judgment for $6,293 that he has not paid (&para; 1.l); 16 delinquent debts that were placed for collection totaling 
more than $41,000 (&para;&para; 1.a-1.k, 1.m-1.q); and has financial resources to make payment on some of these debts, but has not done so (&para; 1.r). Applicant denies each 
allegation, except those in &para;&para; 1.e, 1.l, 1.p. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate fund's. 
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations 
(DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and was unable or unwilling to pay his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the evidence established a potential disqualifying condition, Applicant 
had the burden to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive  E3.1.15.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has made a dedicated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors and otherwise resolve his delinquent debts. MC E2.A6.1.3.6. There are clear 
indications Applicant has matured and fully comprehends the Government's concerns about his financial history. He has made substantial progress in paying 
off his debts. He is diligently working to resolve his remaining debts and understands he needs to follow through.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para; 1.r alleges Applicant's personal financial statement indicated he was not paying his debts even though he had adequate financial resources to begin 
paying them off. In fact, the personal financial statement on which this allegation was based was prepared shortly after he obtained his new job with a 
substantial increase in pay and before he had the opportunity to use this money to pay off his delinquent debts. Since then, Applicant has been resolving his 
debts in an expeditious manner. He realizes that he has to continue to fully resolve all of these debts if he wishes to be eligible for access to classified 
information. Of special concern is the full resolution of the judgment that is still outstanding. I have considered all of the evidence, the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, and the adjudicative process factors contained in Directive &para; 6.3. I find for Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN></P>
