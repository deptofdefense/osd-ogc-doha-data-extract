<P>Applicant was potentially susceptible to foreign preference where his father was a citizen and resident of South Korea, and where he had continued contact with 
long- time friends now employed by the South Korean government--a government known to target U.S. financial interests in its intelligence operations. 
Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant challenged the 10 April 2002 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of foreign preference and foreign influence.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 3 June 2002 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the 
case to me 2 July 2002 and I convened a hearing on 5 December 2002. DOHA received the transcript 13 December 2002.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 10 February 2003, I issued an unfavorable decision, finding for Applicant on Guideline C (Foreign Preference) but against him on Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence). Applicant timely appealed, and on 31 July 2003, the Appeal Board remanded the case to me for further processing consistent with the rulings and 
instructions set forth in the remand decision, which I incorporate by reference. My resolution of the Guideline C allegations is not at issue in this remand.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact. He is a  41-year old employee of a defense 
contractor seeking access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance. To the extent the Appeal Board did not find them to be error, I 
incorporate by reference my findings of fact from my 10 February 2003 decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2001, when Applicant applied for a security clearance (GE 1), he was asked to disclose any employment by foreign governments (question 13) and 
any contacts with foreign governments (question 14 ) other than official U.S. government business or routine immigration matters. In response to both 
questions, he truthfully disclosed his employment by the South Korean Ministry of Finance from May 1987 to June 1990. He also disclosed "have friends 
(Korean nationals) working in the World Bank, the IMF, and Korean Embassy in Washington, DC."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his January 2001 sworn statement (GE 2), Applicant elaborated on those foreign contacts. In a listing of foreign contacts in the U.S., he listed five friends 
from college and two from his time at the Ministry of Finance who were Korean government employees. Of his college friends, one was a Director, Tax 
Collection Agency who was currently working as the tax attache at the Korean Embassy.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Another friend was a Director, Korea Fair Trade Commission who 
was currently working as the fair trade attache at the Korean Embassy.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> A third friend was a Director, Ministry of Finance and Economy, currently working as 
an economist at the World Bank.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A fourth friend was a Director, Ministry of Information and Communications who was then a graduate student in the U.S.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
The fifth friend was a Director, Bank of Korea, currently working at a U.S. office of the Bank of Korea.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two of Applicant's friends date from his time at the Ministry of Finance. One is the Director, Ministry of Finance and Economy, currently working as an 
economist at the World Bank. <A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The other  is the Director, Korean Customs Agency, currently working as an exchange officer with the U.S. Customs Service.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
Applicant also noted reconnecting with two of his high school classmates at an alumni gathering in the U.S. in 2000. One was a Director, Korean Customs 
Agency, working as the customs attache at the Korean Embassy. The other was a Director, Ministry of Justice, working as the legal counselor at the Korean 
Embassy.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant characterizes these contacts as "casual and infrequent." In his January 2001 sworn statement he described them thus:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. . . My friends working at the Korean Embassy are my shadows from the past work experiences at the Korean Ministry of Finance. They might just call me for 
no obvious reason because we have been friends for last twenty years. Most of them became friends even before we started to work for Korean Government. 
However, the shadows are getting dimmer and dimmer since we have no common things to talk or share any more. . .</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledged at the hearing that these friends had contacted him in the U.S. Despite the passage of time since he had seen them, the contact by at 
least one friend came as no surprise (Tr. 132). He surmised that his friends obtained his telephone number somewhere and they contacted him to get 
information about living in the area. He also claimed some notoriety among his past friends and colleagues in the Korean Government: "So in some sense, I am 
sort of legendary in Ministry of Finance, because I was the first guy who got stipend from American university." (Tr. 138-139). Applicant asserts that he has not 
had any further contact with these friends since they returned to Korea.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2001, Applicant gifted his condominium in South Korea to his father because of security concerns suggested to Applicant during his subject 
interview. At the time, the property was rented, and Applicant's father took title subject to the lease. However, rents in South Korea work differently than in the 
U.S.: the renter deposits a large, agreed sum with the landlord, who then has the use of the money until the end of the lease. At the end of the lease term, the 
landlord returns the entire original amount to the renter. Presumably, the effective cost of the rental is whatever the landlord is able to earn with the principal 
during the rental period.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because he took title subject to the lease, Applicant's father would have to make the necessary refund to the renter at the end of the lease term. The property 
was valued at about $80,000.00. The refund to the renter was about $60,000.00. However, the father apparently had sufficient cash reserves to make the refund. 
In June 1997 (A.E. A), when Applicant still owned the condominium, he took about $57,000.00 cash out of the property, when Applicant's father wired 
Applicant money out of the father's accounts so Applicant and his wife could buy a house in the U.S. Applicant's father has not sought repayment of this 
amount, and further, took on repayment of the $60,000.00 rental refund that Applicant would otherwise have been required to make. Applicant and his wife 
have equity in two properties in the U.S. and other liquid assets that total approximately $420,000.00. (Answer).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father and his half-brother are citizens of South Korea, residing in South Korea. Applicant last had contact with his half-brother in 2000, and had 
little contact with him before that. Applicant has regular contact with his father--a 73-year-old retired teacher--by telephone and visited him in Korea in 1997 
(when his mother died) and 2000 (when his brother died). His father has visited the U.S. twice to visit Applicant and see his grandchildren, but does not want to 
immigrate to the U.S. because he is uncomfortable with the language. Applicant's sister is still a Korean citizen, but now resides with Applicant in the U.S., and 
is seeking to become a legal permanent resident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The South Korean government has an aggressive, effective intelligence-gathering organization that targets economic and proprietary information in the U.S. 
(G.E. 3).<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B 
(Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B by demonstrating that Applicant's father is a citizen and resident South Korea,<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and 
he has seven friends of long standing who work for various agencies of the South Korean government that have international reach.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> His regular 
communication with his father, his occasional financial support to his father, and his travel to South Korea for family funerals in 1997 and 2000 demonstrate his 
close ties of affection.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In my original decision, I expressed concern about the ownership status of Applicant's condominium, and had reservations about whether it might still 
constitute a financial interest.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> The Appeal Board concluded that I erred by not clearly articulating my reasons for concluding that Applicant remained indebted 
to his father and by failing to consider the value of the foreign interest against Applicant's holdings in the U.S. Having re-evaluated the record, I conclude that 
Applicant does not have a financial interest in a foreign country, or if he does, it is minimal in comparison to his financial holdings in the U.S.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant transferred his interest in the condominium to his father in October 2001, by gift. That he did so specifically to address a security concern suggested 
during his subject interview causes me to be wary, but Applicant's documentation makes it clear he has no ownership interest in the condominium. However, a 
lingering concern is that Applicant apparently rented his $80,000.00 condominium by taking a $60,000.00 deposit from his renter in accordance with South 
Korean financial practice. I calculate that as $20,000.00 equity for Applicant. His rental income amounted to whatever he earned on the $60,000.00 during the 
term of the lease, after which he must repay the deposit to the renter. But Applicant got a $57,000.00 cash transfer from his father in June  1997 so Applicant 
could make a down payment on a property in the U.S. Applicant has not had to repay that transfer. In addition, although Applicant gifted the condominium to 
his father in October, and presumably the $20,000.00 equity, the father is now responsible to repay the $60,000.00 deposit  to the renter. Applicant has not 
explained how his father--a retired principal of a high school, a member of the same disfavored ethnic group as Applicant, and a person Applicant has 
previously provided financial support to--is able to afford cash payments of $117,000.00 (assuming the equity is not liquidated). Nevertheless, I conclude that 
any obligation by Applicant to his father is filial, not legal, and thus only a further indication of his close ties to his father. Accordingly, I find the allegations of 
2.b. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant fails to meet most of the relevant mitigating conditions under foreign influence, and the mitigating condition he arguably meets is 
insufficient to overcome the applicable disqualifying conditions. While Applicant's father does not appear to be an agent of a foreign power, Applicant has not 
demonstrated that he is not otherwise so situated as to be a point of influence on Applicant.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Further, although the Appeal Board took issue with my 
characterization of Applicant's friends as "good friends" "involved with foreign policy," those characterizations do not change the fact that Applicant has seven 
friends of long standing who are employed by the South Korean Government. They are the kind of friends who go to the trouble to look Applicant up when they 
are in the U.S., sometimes even when they are not even in the same state. They are the kind of friends Applicant took the trouble to look up when he returned to 
South Korea after many years in the U.S. These friends have served in the South Korean Embassy in the U.S., in other South Korean agencies present in the 
U.S., as official liaison to other U.S. agencies, and assigned to international non-governmental agencies located in the U.S. They clearly constitute "associates 
who are connected with any foreign government" under DC 3. For purposes of this DC it matters not whether their role is foreign policy, diplomatic, or routine 
governmental. What matters is that Applicant contacts were the result of his friendship and not any U.S. government business, precluding application of MC 
2.<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  And while there is an argument for application of MC 3,<A HREF="02-04455.h2.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> in the overall context of this case the contacts are not casual or infrequent. The friendships are 
long-standing, most going back more than 20 years. They resume easily after several years of no contact. Even accepting Applicant's assertions that the 
connections are weakening with the passing of the years, these past contacts present a potential avenue for future contacts aimed at influencing Applicant, 
whether through positive or negative pressure. This is particularly true where </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the foreign country at issue is South Korea, a country known to target U.S. 
economic interests in its intelligence gathering. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I resolve Guideline B against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
