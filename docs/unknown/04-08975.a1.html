<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June 14, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 3, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Michael J. 
Breslin denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.<A HREF="04-08975.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline G is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance should be reversed because Applicant had been alcohol free since 2004.  Given the record 
of this case, the Board does not find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Administrative Judge to make a favorable security clearance 
decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge made sustainable findings as to a  lengthy and serious history excessive alcohol consumption that included diagnoses for 
alcohol dependence and alcoholism.<A HREF="04-08975.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying 
conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in Applicant's favor with respect to one of the factual 
allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the 
government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline G is not arbitrary, 
capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, Applicant argues that an unfavorable decision will adversely impact his employment situation.  The possibility that an unfavorable security clearance 
decision could have adverse consequences for an applicant's job situation is not relevant or material to an evaluation of the security significance of that 
applicant's conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 8 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).</SPAN></P>
