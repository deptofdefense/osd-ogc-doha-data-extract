<P>On August 22, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust, an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the application

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In her SOR response, Applicant admits to the debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.x and denies all remaining allegations. Applicant's admission is incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful 
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 34-year-old claims analyst with a Department of Defense contractor who is seeking a position of public trust.  She has worked for the same employer for the past four years. She has 
graduated from business college.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In November 1996, Applicant married.  Two daughters were born of the marriage.  They are currently ages eight and six.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In March 2001, she separated from her husband due to his alcoholism and 
abusive treatment. She and her daughters moved to the state where her parents live. She and her husband had a verbal agreement that she would take care of the children's expenses and he would pay off 
the debts acquired during the marriage.  He did not fulfill his part of the agreement.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Several collection agencies mailed letters to Appellant after she had moved.  She did not contact them because she 
was unable to pay the debts.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 22, 2004, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85-P).<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In response to question 22b, she listed three delinquent accounts and indicated that she had 
approximately 20 delinquent accounts which were delinquent/written off. She stated that most of the debt was her husband's which he neglected to pay but admitted her name is on the accounts. She 
indicated she was unable to list all of the accounts since most had been transferred to collection agencies.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant has 24 delinquent accounts with a total approximate balance of $29,276.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The accounts included a $92 credit card account which was 
placed for collection in January 1998 (SOR &para; 1.a); a $850 gas station credit card account which was placed for collection in March 1998 (SOR &para; 1.b); a $961 account past due since April 1998 (SOR &para; 
1.c); a $170 account placed for collection in April 1998 (SOR &para; 1.d); a $771 account placed for collection in May 1998 (SOR &para; 1.e); a $513 account placed for collection in May 1998 (SOR &para; 1.f); a

(SOR &para; 1.i); a $7,642 automobile loan charged off in August 2000 (SOR &para; 1.j); a $578 credit card account placed for collection in August 2000 (SOR &para; 1.k); a $5,166 account placed for collection in 
September 2000 (SOR &para; 1.l); a $102 account placed for collection in October 2000 (SOR &para; 1.m); a $805 account charged off as a bad debt in November 2000 (SOR &para; 1.n);  a $2,710 account charged off 
as a bad debt in November 2000 (SOR &para; 1.o); a $730 account placed for collection in December 2000 (SOR &para; 1.p); a $176 cable account placed for collection in December 2000 (SOR &para; 1.q); a  $770 
account placed for collection in December 2000 (SOR &para; 1.r); a $1,683 account placed for collection in December 2000 (SOR &para; 1.s); a $45 home heating oil account placed for collection in March 2001 
(SOR &para; 1.t); a $236 unspecified medical account placed for collection in August 2001 (SOR &para; 1.u); a $595 unspecified medical account placed for collection in April 2002 (SOR &para; 1.v); a $408 ladies 
clothing store credit card account placed for collection in June 2002 (SOR &para; 1.w); and a $70 medical account placed for collection in May 2003 (SOR &para; 1.x).        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admits that these debts were joint debts incurred while she lived with her husband but only claims responsibility for the debt alleged in SOR &para; 1.x. This was a $70 medical bill that she 
incurred after moving away from her husband.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> This debt has not been paid. She thought the debt was covered by insurance and did not learn that it was not until she called the office.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> When asked 
why she did not pay this debt since she admits it was hers, she claims that she did not know how to get a hold of the creditor so she just did not do it.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>No legal separation agreement or divorce proceeding has been initiated.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Applicant filed an order for child support in order to receive medical benefits for her children but has never received child 
support from her husband.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  The last time she saw her husband was April 2005. His last contact with the children was by telephone in February 2006.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her daughters live in a house that is owned by her parents. She pays no rent. If needed, her parents help her out financially.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Her take home pay is $1,600 a month.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  She admits that she 
is financially over-extended on paper but her financial responsibilities are manageable on a day-to-day basis.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Aside from the $70 medical bill, she has not incurred additional delinquent debt since 
separating from her husband. She has two open credit card accounts which have balances of $200 and $150.  She makes monthly payments on these accounts.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Her oldest daughter has special needs 
but is covered by state medical insurance.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></P>

due to the expense.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> She does not intend to resolve the delinquent debts.<A HREF="05-10061.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F - Financial Considerations with 
respect to SOR &para;&para; 1.a - 1.t, and 1.w - 1.x.  I find for Applicant with respect to SOR &para;&para; 1.u and 1.v.  Both of these allegations allege Applicant owes an "unspecified creditor" for a medical account.  I find 
this pleading is too vague and fails to provide adequate notice with regard to the identity of the creditor.   </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC 3 (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply 
to Applicant's case.  Between 1998 and 2003, she and her husband incurred 24 delinquent accounts, an approximate total of $29,276.  Although her estranged husband agreed to be responsible for all 
marital debts, he did not pay the debts and she remains jointly liable for the debts. She is unable and unwilling to pay the debts.  </P> 
 
<P>I considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Most of Applicant's delinquent debts remain unpaid and unresolved.  Therefore, I cannot apply FC MC 1 (<EM>The behavior was 
not recent</EM>).  I cannot apply FC MC 2 (<EM>It was an isolated incident</EM>), due to the numerous delinquent accounts.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or 
separation)</EM>) applies.  It is reasonable to conclude that Applicant's separation from her husband in March 2001 contributed to her financial problems.  However, five years have passed since she and her 
children moved to another state. She could have pursued several options to deal with the delinquent marital debts but has chosen to ignore the situation. FC MC 3 applies, in part, but Applicant's 
inaction towards resolving the marital debts gives this mitigating condition less weight.</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>).  Applicant has not attended financial 
counseling.  Her delinquent debts remain outstanding. She does not intend to resolve the debts.  Although Applicant's current financial situation appears to have improved, the issue of the old delinquent 
debt remains. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) cannot be applied as well. Applicant has taken no action towards resolving her delinquent 
accounts.  She has lived apart from her husband for over five years and was aware that he did not pay these delinquent debts.  Collection agencies have contacted her at her new residence. She did 
nothing because she stated that she would be unable to resolve these delinquent debts. While her husband's failure to live up to the terms of their verbal agreement  may seem unfair, she could have 
pursued several options rather than ignoring the situation.  She could have pursued a legally binding separation agreement which outlined who was responsible for the debts and held her husband 
responsible for child support. She could have consulted with a financial credit counselor to discuss the possibility of repayment options or even bankruptcy.  She did not even attempt to resolve the one 
debt which she admits is her responsibility. This was a $70 debt which should have been one of the easier debts to resolve. I cannot conclude she made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts.   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concern under Guideline F.   Guideline F is decided against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthiness determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative 
trustworthiness implications. I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding Guideline F based on her inaction towards resolving 
her delinquent accounts. Based on the evidence in the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
