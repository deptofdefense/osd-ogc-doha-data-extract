  The Applicant is a naturalized American citizen from FC1.  He does not have an FC1 passport and is not a dual citizen.  His brothers live in two separate foreign countries, but he mitigated the adverse inference of this allegation.  However, the Applicant also had severe debt problems which he has not yet  resolved, and has no plan for solving in the near future.  Overall, adverse inference is not overcome.  Clearance is denied.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 22, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 25, 2001, and requested that the case be decided without a hearing.  </SPAN>The Government submitted its File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant on August 29, 2001.  The Applicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit any documents in 
rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant received the FORM on September 7, 2001, and submitted a response on September 27, 2001<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Department 
Counsel did not object to the Applicant's additional information.  The case was received by the undersigned on October 5, 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 46, married and has a Master of Science degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR.  They are based on the FORM, the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the 
exhibits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to show a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in Foreign Country 1 (FC1) in 1955.  He moved to the United States in 1984.  The Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in 
1996.  In his Answer to the SOR at page 2, the Applicant states, "On May 19<SUP>th</SUP>, 1996, as per instructions of the U.S. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Services, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">I 
surrendered my [FC1] passport to the U.S. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Officer at [an American city]</SPAN>.  I consequently took oath of Allegiance and received my 
Naturalization Certificate . . . .  I was not aware of the requirement to return the passport to the issuing authority."  (Government Exhibit 3.)  (Emphasis in 
original.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Response to the FORM, the Applicant submitted a letter dated September 19, 2001,  from the Third Secretary (Political/Education) of the FC1 Embassy.  
This official states, "This is to certify that [the Applicant], has fully and completely renounced his [FC1] citizenship. [The Applicant's FC1] passport expired in 
1996 and [the Applicant] does not possess or use any Passport issued by [FC1]."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has 
immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to 
duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's brother is a FC1 citizen and still lives there.  The Applicant's mother and father-in-law moved to the United States in March 2001 and are 
permanent residents.  (<EM>See</EM>, Answer to the SOR.)  The Applicant has no plans to visit FC1 in the future.  The Applicant speaks to his brother approximately 
every month.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's other brother lives in FC2.  FC2 is in close geographical proximity to the United States.  The Applicant visits this country with his family on a 
yearly basis and usually visits with his brother.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially overextended and at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.a.  This debt in the original amount of $3,600.00 concerns a credit card.  The Applicant has disputed this debt because he does not recognize the bank name.  
Two of three credit reporting agencies have removed it from his file.  In his Response to the FORM the Applicant states that he will make a good-faith effort to 
resolve this disputed amount and pay it off within two years.  Based on all available information, I find that this is the Applicant's debt and he has not made any 
firm plans to pay it off.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.b.  This Applicant has paid this debt off.  Accordingly, this subparagraph is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.c.  The Applicant admits that he is responsible for this debt.  However, he disputes the amount of the debt.  The original amount of the debt is over $3,000.00.  
With interest, the amount is over $8,000.00.  In his Response to the FORM the Applicant states that he will make a good-faith effort to resolve this disputed 
amount and pay it off within two years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.d.  The Applicant admits that he is responsible for this debt, in the amount of approximately $3,500.00.  In his Response to the FORM the Applicant states 
that he will attempt to pay this debt off within two years.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submits that these debts were all incurred eight years ago.  At that time the Applicant was unemployed and unable to make payments on these 
debts.  The Applicant discussed these debts in depth with a Defense Security Service Special Agent in June 2000.  (Exhibits 6 and 7.)   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case 
are:</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C (Foreign preference)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.) </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B (Foreign influence)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F (Financial considerations)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of financial irreponsibility, as well as having foreign connections and preferences, that demonstrates poor judgement, 
untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting or continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with 
evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of 
persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has foreign connections, that he possessed a FC1 
passport at one time and that he has had financial problems.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is a naturalized citizen of the United States.  He has submitted compelling evidence from the FC1 embassy that he is not a dual citizen and that 
he does not now have or use a FC1 passport.  In fact, he has not had an FC1 passport since he became an American citizen.  Guideline C is found for the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother and father-in-law now live in the United States, thereby obviating any security concern about them.  His brother in FC2 lives in a 
country in close proximity to the United States.  As the Applicant stated, common sense must be used when discussing travel to this particular nation.  The 
Applicant stated that he has no future intentions to visit FC1.  His relations with his brothers are cordial but are not, in my opinion, close.  He has overcome the 
adverse inference of his foreign connections and Guideline B is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has known since June 2000 of the Government's concern with his debt situation.  The Applicant accepts his responsibility for these debts, but 
has done nothing substantial about them in the ensuing 15 months.  The debt in subparagraph 1.b. has been paid, and that subparagraph is found for the 
Applicant.  He submits that he will resolve the other debts within two years of the date of the FORM.  That is much too late.  He has not initiated a good-faith 
effort to resolve these debts and cannot be found to have mitigated this allegation.  Guideline F is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the weight of the Government's evidence opposing his request for a security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Reasons.  
As stated previously, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Statement of Reasons are found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
