<P>Applicant's 1983 criminal conduct raises security concerns: while chief procurement counsel to a federal agency, he violated 18 U.S.C. Section 201(g) when he 
received gratuities from a federal contractor.  After he pleaded guilty, the sentence of the U.S. District Court in November 1985 included two years 
imprisonment (suspended).  Clear evidence of successful rehabilitation and the absence of any subsequent criminal conduct over the past 16 years mitigates 
security concerns over his actions that led to his debarment being extended in 1988.  His state Supreme Court reinstated him to the practice of law in 1988, and 
Applicant represents government contractors.  The Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Section 986) disqualifies anyone convicted and sentenced to imprisonment 
for more than one year.  Clearance is denied.  Applicant requested a waiver based on the length of time since his 1985 conviction and his 1988 readmission to 
practice law.  A waiver is recommended.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on August 30, 2001.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over criminal conduct (Guideline J), including an allegation that his criminal conduct 
disqualifies Applicant from having a security clearance because of 10 U.S.C. Section 986, unless in a meritorious case the Secretary of Defense authorizes an 
exception.  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on September 24, 2001, where he admitted with explanations paragraph 1.a., 
admitted in part and denied in part paragraph 1.b. and  under paragraph 1.c. requested a waiver.  He requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on November 1, 2001, attested it was ready to proceed.  On November 5, 2001, the case was assigned to me.  
Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to and a Notice of Hearing was issued on November 28, 2001, which set the matter for 
December 17, 2001, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  At the hearing the Government introduced nine exhibits which were all admitted into 
evidence (Exhibits 1-9).  The Applicant testified, but offered no<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> exhibits.  The  transcript (TR) was received on December 26, 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 73 years old, has been self-employed<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> with Defense Contractor #3 in State #1 since March 1986.  He anticipates working two more years before he 
retires but does not foresee handling any classified materials.  He previously had been a federal government employee from May 1966 to November 1985 where 
he handled dozens of classified documents.  While in federal service in 1972, he became a GM-15 chief counsel for a federal agency which was located in State 
#1; he resigned in November 1985.  In May 1967 the Office of Personnel Management had granted him a Secret clearance.  (Exhibits 1, 2, 7; TR 18, 20-25, 26)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant served in the military from 1951-1956 and subsequently on inactive reserve duty.  He was married in 1953 and widowed in January 1991; he has 
three children.  He remarried in November 1996.  (Exhibit 1)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct </STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant in October 1983 received a 1982 sedan from a defense contractor with a retail value in excess of $14,000 for which he paid $7,000.  He initially 
misrepresented to his co-workers the source of the car.  Applicant was indicted in August 1985 for federal felony offenses under 18 U.S.C. Sections 201(c) for 
accepting a bribe and 201(g), for accepting gratuities from a defense contractor while Applicant was employed as chief counsel to a federal agency where his 
official duties were to provide legal advice and service to contracting officers to assist in federal contract administration.  In his position he came to know Mr C, 
an officer<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> of Defense Contractor #1, a company that did federal contracting with Applicant's agency.  When he learned that Mr. C would sell company 
vehicles, he purchased one from Mr. C for $7,000.  While Applicant considered that a "fair" price, federal investigators determined that the vehicle was instead 
worth approximately $14,000.  At the time he had matters pending before him regarding contracts awarded to this defense contractor.  He was charged with 
receiving the vehicle as a gratuity for a favorable decision rendered on behalf of Mr. C's company.  Applicant pleaded<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> guilty in September 1985 to two counts 
of accepting gratuities while a federal employee, a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 201(g).  (The bribery charge was dropped.)  In November 1985 the U.S. 
District Court in State #1 sentenced Applicant to two years imprisonment (suspended), three years federal probation, a $20,000 fine, and 400 hour of 
community service.  He never served any time in prison and had an early release from probation in June 1988.  He has not subsequently been involved with any 
criminal activity.   (Exhibits 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8; TR 22, 27-30, 34-35, 40-43)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on his November 1985 conviction he was advised in December 1985 that a federal agency proposed that he be debarred from contracting with any 
agency in the Executive Branch of the Federal Government for a three year period as his conduct evidenced a lack of business integrity and honesty that 
affected his ability to do business responsibly with the Federal Government.   (Exhibit 3)  He was debarred from December 1985 to December 1988.  (Exhibit 
6; TR 35-36)  Further, he was advised of his Expulsion from United States Military Installation as his presence was prejudicial to good order and discipline and 
maximum effectiveness because of his guilty plea to a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 201g.  (Exhibit 4)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was still debarred in February 1988 when he attended<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> a meeting in State #2 with Defense Contractor #2.  The government concluded he improperly 
acted as a consultant in contract discussions with the Government; consequently, Applicant's debarment was extended six months until June 1989 because his 
action violated his existing debarment.  (Exhibit 6; TR 31-32, 37)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Successful Rehabilitation</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the rules of State #1, Applicant was suspended from practicing law in State #1 when he was convicted.  Later, even though the state Disciplinary Board 
asked for his disbarment, the state Supreme Court reinstated him to the practice of law in 1988.  (Applicant provided no documentation of this decision, but 
testified to his current good standing in the bar of his state.)  (TR 22, 25-26, 37-38, 41-42)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Currently, Applicant practices law and represents government contractors; he has appeared before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals.  (TR 37-38)  
He never sought a pardon<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> although he knows his Member of Congress socially.  (TR 46)  Applicant's community service includes being treasurer of his condo 
association and involvement with health charities and charitable work with lawyers which provides anonymous charitable donations and no cost legal services. 
(TR 45-46) He is a member of his state bar association as well as the American Bar Association and the Federal Bar Association.  (TR 46)</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A provision of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, 10 U.S.C. Section 986 ("The Smith Amendment"),  mandates 
restrictions on the granting or renewal of security clearances.  This statutory limitation was implemented within the Department of Defense by a June 7, 2001, 
emorandum, and within DOHA by Operating Instruction (OI) 64, issued on July 10, 2001.  Statutory provision (1) disqualifies a person who "has been 
convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year."  DoD implementing guidance interpreted 
this language to including "person with convictions in both State and Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses with sentences imposed of <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">more than</SPAN> one year, 
regardless of the amount of time actually served." This case falls within this statutory provision.  However, the Smith Amendment establishes authority for the 
Secretary of Defense (or the Secretary of the military department concerned) to grant a waiver where meritorious cases exist.  This authority may not be 
delegated.  Neither the statute, nor DoD, nor the DOHA Director in the OI has defined "meritorious circumstances." </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government maintains security concerns over Applicant's criminal conduct: he pleaded guilty in November 1985 to violating18 U.S.C. Section 201(g) 
when he received gratuities from a federal contractor in 1983 while he served as chief procurement counsel to a federal agency as detailed in the Findings 
above.  In November 1985 the U.S. District Court in State #1 sentenced Applicant to two years imprisonment (suspended), three years federal probation, a 
$20,000 fine, and 400 hour of community service.  Applicant's felony conviction was an integrity offense that he committed while he was chief counsel for a 
federal agency.  Further this conduct led to his being debarred from doing business with the U.S. Government from December 1985 to December 1988, and he 
was formally expelled from the US military installation where he had previously worked.  When he later attended a contractual meeting in February 1988 with a 
defense contractor, the Government concluded he had violated the debarment and extended the prohibition for six more months.  Finally, a provision of the 
Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, 10 U.S.C. Section 986 ("The Smith Amendment"), as implemented by DoD, 
mandates restrictions on the granting or renewal of security clearances: provision (1) disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts with 
sentences imposed of more than one year, regardless of time actually served. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To his credit Applicant never served any time in prison and had an early release from probation in June 1988.  There is no evidence that he has subsequently 
been involved with any criminal activity.  In 1988 Applicant was reinstated to the practice of law and has subsequently practiced law in State #1 for over a 
decade and also represented government contractors in federal administrative proceedings.  He has appeared before the Armed Services Board of Contract 
Appeals.  Further, Applicant's community service includes being treasurer of his condo association and involvement with health charities and charitable work 
with other lawyers.  Consequently, the actions that led to his debarment and the extension of his debarment in February 1988 may now be mitigated under 
condition (a) as the behavior was not recent, (d) . . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur; and (f) there is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation.  Indeed, debarment is a civil, not a criminal action by the Government.  Currently, Applicant practices law and is a member of his state, Federal 
and American bar associations. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, as implemented by DoD, the statutory provision in 10 U.S.C. Section 986 makes no exception for the amount of time actually served or subsequent 
rehabilitation.  Consequently, despite the passage of time and his rehabilitation as a lawyer, this statutory provisions mandates doubt over his current 
trustworthiness and access to classified information as he was previously convicted of a crime and sentenced for a term exceeding one year.  Whether he is fully 
rehabilitated from his criminal conduct is not material under 10 U.S.C. Section 986.  Thus, his 1985 criminal conduct cannot be mitigated<A HREF="01-17235.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> under this statutory 
provision.  After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 1.a. and 
1.c., but for Applicant on subparagraph 1.b. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 1.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Request for Waiver</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has requested a waiver based on the length of time since his 1985 conviction, a period of sixteen years. He based his request for waiver on his 
testimony that he was reinstated to the practice of law in 1988 and his testimony of his community service work.  Applicant was given the opportunity to submit 
additional evidence of his meritorious circumstances, but did not provide any documentary evidence of his post-conviction conduct, character, and reputation in 
the community or other factors that might be considered relevant in evaluating a case for waiver.  He no longer foresees his having any need to have access to 
classified information as he has resigned from being an operating officer at the company which had originally sought a security clearance for him.  DOHA OI 
64 explicitly prohibits an administrative judge from providing an explanation for a waiver recommendation.  I recommend further consideration of this case for 
a waiver under 10 U.S.C. 986.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>  Applicant was given an additional ten days (until December 27, 2001) to submit exhibits, but did not submit any documents.  (TR 38-40, 46-48, 56) 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>  Applicant's client had to apply for a facility clearance; since he was a minority stock holder and was working at that facility at that time, the Defense 
Security Service concluded Applicant himself needed a security clearance as Applicant was asked to handle the security applications.  When Applicant's 
security clearance was initially not granted, the company lost its facility clearance.  Thus, Applicant subsequently resigned from being an operating officer at the 
company and sold back his stock.  (TR 23-25) 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>  Mr. C , Defense Contractor #1's CEO, pled guilty in December 1985 to one count violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 201(f) and was sentenced in January 1986

<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>  Applicant chose to plead guilty rather than go to trial as his wife had cancer at the time.  He did not want her to go through a trial as they anticipated she 
would only have one year to live; she lived for four years.  (TR 43) 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>  Applicant admits he attended the meeting, but disputes that he represented this contractor at the meeting: Applicant claimed to be "just sitting around the 
house" at the time as he was still suspended from practicing law when a "good friend" asked him to attend the meeting in State #2; he did not sit at the 
conference table, but did have discussions with some of the people there because he knew them.  He admits talking about one issue as he had experience with 
that issue when he worked for the agency.  He was not paid to attend the meeting.  (TR 21-22, 31-33, 36) 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>  Seeking a pardon is an exercise of executive clemency as authorized under Article II, Section 2, of the Constitution. Under the Constitution, the President's 
clemency power extends only to federal criminal offenses. In general, a pardon is granted on the basis of the petitioner's demonstrated good conduct for a 
substantial period of time after conviction and service of sentence.  <STRONG>See</STRONG> <A HREF="http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/">http://www.usdoj.gov/pardon/</A>  The Department of Justice's regulations require a 
petitioner to wait a period of at least five years after conviction or release from confinement (whichever is later) before filing a pardon application (28 C.F.R. 
&sect;1.2). In determining whether a particular petitioner should be recommended for a pardon, the principal factors taken into account are outlined in Section 1-2.112  <STRONG>Standards for Considering Pardon Petitions</STRONG>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1. Post-conviction conduct, character, and reputation. </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual's demonstrated ability to lead a responsible and productive life for a significant period after conviction or release from confinement is strong 
evidence of rehabilitation and worthiness for pardon. The background investigation . . .focuses on the petitioner's financial and employment stability, 
responsibility toward family, reputation in the community, participation in community service, charitable or other meritorious activities and, if applicable, 
military record. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>2. Seriousness and relative recentness of the offense. </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an offense is very serious (e.g., a violent crime, major drug trafficking, breach of public trust, or white collar fraud involving substantial sums of money), 
a suitable length of time should have elapsed in order to avoid denigrating the seriousness of the offense or undermining the deterrent effect of the conviction. 
In the case of a prominent individual or notorious crime, the likely effect of a pardon on law enforcement interests or upon the general public should be taken 
into account. When an offense is very old and relatively minor, the equities may weigh more heavily in favor of forgiveness, provided the petitioner is otherwise 
a suitable candidate for pardon. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>3. Acceptance of responsibility, remorse, and atonement</STRONG>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The extent to which a petitioner has accepted responsibility for his or her criminal conduct and made restitution to its victims are important considerations. A 
petitioner should be genuinely desirous of forgiveness rather than vindication.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>4. Need for relief. </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The purpose for which pardon is sought may influence disposition of the petition. A felony conviction may result in a wide variety of legal disabilities under 
state or federal law, some of which can provide persuasive grounds for recommending a pardon. For example, a specific employment-related need for pardon, 
such as removal of a bar to licensure or bonding, may make an otherwise marginal case sufficiently compelling to warrant a grant in aid of the individual's 
continuing rehabilitation. On the other hand, the absence of a specific need should not be held against an otherwise deserving applicant, who may 
understandably be motivated solely by a strong personal desire for a sign of forgiveness. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>5. Official recommendations and reports. </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The comments and recommendations of concerned and knowledgeable officials, particularly the United States Attorney whose office prosecuted the case and 
the sentencing judge, are carefully considered. The likely impact of favorable action in the district or nationally, particularly on current law enforcement 
priorities, will always be relevant to the President's decision. Apart from their significance to the individuals who seek them, pardons can play an important part 
in defining and furthering the rehabilitative goals of the criminal justice system.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The criminal behavior was not recent; b.  The crime was an isolated incident; c.  The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those 
pressures are no longer present in that person's life; d.  The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to 
recur; e.  Acquittal; f.  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation; g.  Potentially disqualifying conditions. . . .may not be mitigated unless, where 
meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of Defense or the Secretary of the military Department concerned has granted a waiver.</SPAN></P>
