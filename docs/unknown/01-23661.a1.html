  Administrative Judge's analysis of Applicant's history of financial difficulties is consistent with pertinent provisions of the Directive and does not reflect reasoning that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not  sufficient to demonstrate the Judge erred.  Under the Directive there is no authority to grant a conditional or probationary security clearance.  Adverse decision  affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated July 29, 2002 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  
Administrative Judge Roger E. Willmeth issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated June 25, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) are 
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and (2) whether Applicant can be granted a conditional or probationary security clearance.  For the reasons that follow, 
the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant has presented new evidence for consideration in his case and offers to present additional information about his post-hearing efforts to deal 
with his financial difficulties.  An Administrative Judge's decision is reviewed based on the record evidence that was before the Judge, and the Board cannot 
consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Accordingly, the Board will consider only those arguments 
made by Applicant that do not rely on new evidence.</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  Apart 
from four debts for which the  Administrative Judge entered formal findings in favor of Applicant,<A HREF="01-23661.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to 
demonstrate extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant argues: (a) his financial difficulties have been the result of circumstances outside his control; (b) he has been working hard to address his 
outstanding debts and will continue to do so; (c) he will continue to work on resolving his outstanding debts; and (d) he is a hard-working, loyal employee for 
his employer and the Department of Defense.  The Board construes Applicant's arguments as raising the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse 
conclusions under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>A review of the decision below shows the following: The Administrative Judge considered the evidence presented by Applicant and took into account evidence 
showing that: (i) circumstances outside of Applicant's control contributed to his financial difficulties, and (ii) Applicant has been working on addressing and 
resolving his outstanding debts.  The Judge evaluated Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties in terms of pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines (Directive, Enclosure 2) and the general factors set forth in Directive, Enclosure 2, Item E2.2.1.  The Judge also took into account the difficult 
personal circumstances of Applicant and his wife.  Finally, the Judge explained why he concluded Applicant's overall history of financial difficulties raised 
security concerns under Guideline F that were not extenuated or mitigated sufficiently by the evidence presented by Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's analysis of Applicant's case is consistent with pertinent provisions of the Directive and does not reflect reasoning that is arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge erred.  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-19278 (April 22, 2003) at p. 7.  Moreover, Applicant's value to his employer and the Department of Defense is not relevant to 
assessing the security significance of his history of financial difficulties.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0435 (September 16, 1999) at pp. 2-3.  Finally, nothing in 
the decision below indicates or suggests the Administrative Judge made any finding or conclusion as to Applicant's loyalty.  <EM>See</EM> Executive Order 10865, 
Section 7 (security clearance decisions made under the Executive Order are not loyalty determinations).</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether Applicant can be granted a conditional or probationary security clearance</SPAN>.  Applicant asks whether he can be granted a conditional or probationary 
security clearance while he is working on his financial problems.  Under the Directive, there is no authority for a Hearing Office Administrative Judge or the 
Board to grant a conditional or probationary security clearance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-22311 (April 4, 2003) at p. 6.</P>
