<P>The security concerns raised pertaining to a 53-year-old Applicant who was born in Greece and is a naturalized U.S. citizen--with relatively insubstantial 
foreign financial interests--who has a brother and friend who are Greek citizens and residents, neither of whom appears to be in a position to be exploited by 
Greece, have been mitigated by the evidence developed herein.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 10, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20,1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In two sworn written answers, dated August 1, 2003, and October 8, 2003, respectively, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected 
to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on January 29, 2004.  A 
complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material 
in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  He made no further submissions.  The case was assigned to me on April 16, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted all the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been revealed.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant was born in 1950 in what was then the Kingdom of Greece--a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1952.  In 1967, a 
military dictatorship came to power, suspended a variety of political and civil liberties, and forced the king to flee.  The dictatorship was overcome by events 
and was replaced in 1974 following democratic elections.  With the abolition of the monarchy, the country became known as the Hellenic Republic (Greece).  
The U.S. Department of State characterizes the country as "a developed and stable democracy with a modern economy."</P> 
 
<P>The facts about Applicant's background are rather sketchy.  In 1967, Applicant entered active service with the Greek Air Force, and remained for nearly 14 
years before leaving in 1983.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  During the period from September 1969 until September 1971, he attended a military technical school and non-commissioned 
officer academy.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>At some unspecified date, Applicant immigrated to the U.S. and accepted a position with a government contractor.  He has been employed by the same 
company since February 1983, and is now a leadworker.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The quality of his professional performance has not been characterized.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant married a native-born U.S. citizen in 1975 in Greece,<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and had two children in the U.S.  He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 1987.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  
He considers himself to be a dual citizen of the U.S. and Greece.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Nevertheless, he contends his loyalties are with his family residing in the U.S. as well as 
with the U.S. itself.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant and his wife were divorced in 1998.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant' s parents are deceased,<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> but he has one brother--a citizen of Greece--who still resides in Greece.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant inherited a house in Greece worth 
$15,000.00,<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and that residence is rented to his brother<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> for an unspecified monthly amount.  He also maintains a Greek savings account with a balance of 
$65,000.00.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Applicant's net monthly take home pay is approximately $2,500.00.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  He has about $2,000.00 in monthly expenses,<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> leaving about $500.00 
available for discretionary spending.  He has an estimated current market value of personal assets of $258,500.00<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> with total estimated liabilities of 
$105,000.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  His total estimated net worth is $180,500.00.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant maintains contact with a friend who had served with him in the Greek Air Force. The frequency of the contact is unspecified as is the nature or 
closeness of the exact relationship.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because he has substantial 
financial interests in Greece that could make him vulnerable to foreign influence.  He inherited a house in Greece which is worth $15,000.00, and maintains a 
Greek savings account with a balance of $65,000.00.  Such a situation raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the 
exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  In this regard, see Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI 
DC) E2.A.2.1.2.8. (<EM>a substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to 
foreign influence</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, even the most superficial examination of Applicant's financial position would support the conclusion that such foreign financial interests are so 
insubstantial as to raise Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.5. (<EM>foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the 
individual's security responsibilities</EM>).  The house he owns in Greece is worth $15,000.00.  That is not a typographical error, masking a luxurious mansion.  
That amount, when contrasted with his U.S. residence--seemingly worth approximately $250,000.00--exposes the weakness of the government's vulnerability 
contention.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Greek savings account, on the other hand, does contain a substantial sum.  Once again, upon evaluating the overall facts and circumstances, the amount 
described, when standing alone, is significant, but when compared with his other assets, does not seem so robust.  It is approximately 30% of his estimated net 
worth.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has also been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because a member of his immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, his brother and a friend from his air force days--are either not citizens or residents of the United States or 
may be subject to duress.  These situations also raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter 
of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.<A HREF="02-31667.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The residency and citizenship status of Applicant's brother and friend gives cause for concern and raises the issue of potential foreign influence.  In this regard, 
see Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>). It is with some interest that I note that no evidence has been offered by the 
government indicating any sinister Greek intentions or activities, such as industrial espionage or active collection of foreign economic information, directed 
towards the United States.  Furthermore, when considered in light of the nature of the Greek government--a free and open democratic society--and that 
government's relationship to the U.S.--a longstanding NATO ally--the overall significance of the brother's citizenship and residency status is minimized, and 
does not constitute an unacceptable security risk  Considering the absence of a scintilla of evidence <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that his brother is a target of any intelligence gathering 
efforts, his residency status does not establish any doubts regarding possible duress.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In this instance, given the rather limited availability of factual information in the record, there is insufficient evidence to support the activation of FI MC 
E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  While an administrative judge should be country neutral when analyzing the evidence in security clearance 
review cases, the administrative judge should not be country ignorant.  Considering the nature of the Greek government and society, and in the absence of any 
Greek sponsored industrial espionage or active collection of foreign economic information, it is unlikely that Applicant's brother is in a position to be exploited 
by Greece in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his brother and the United States.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also, the citizenship and residency of Applicant's friend from his air force days, are of insubstantial concern because there is no evidence that he is a person 
with whom Applicant has close ties or affection or obligation.  In the absence of such evidence, the application of FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3. (<EM>contact and 
correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>) seems appropriate.  Moreover, Applicant's friend resides in a political entity which </SPAN>is a free 
and open democratic society,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and I can see no evidence of attempted exploitation by the Greek government.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence 
of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 
1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
