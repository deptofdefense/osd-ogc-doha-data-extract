  When record contains conflicting evidence, the Administrative Judge must carefully weigh the evidence and make findings that reflect a reasonable interpretation of the evidence.  Record evidence supports Judge's finding that Applicant falsified  a security questionnaire. Rules of evidence and burdens of proof associated with criminal proceedings are not applicable in DOHA  proceedings.  Falsification of a security questionnaire can constitute criminal conduct wholly independent of the criminality of the  conduct being concealed.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge Jerome H. Silber issued a decision dated September 14, 2000, in which  he concluded that it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant has appealed.  The Board 
affirms the Administrative Judge's decision for the reasons explained below.</P> 
 
<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 
1992 as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant 
intentionally falsified a personnel security questionnaire regarding his use of marijuana and by finding that his falsification was not 
mitigated; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's falsification of a personnel security 
questionnaire constituted criminal activity that disqualified Applicant for a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated May 30, 2000 to Applicant.  The SOR 
was based on Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</P> 
 
<P>A hearing was held on August 23, 2000.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision dated September 14, 2000 in which 
he concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The 
case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant intentionally falsified </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">a personnel security questionnaire regarding his use of marijuana and by finding that his falsification was not mitigated.</SPAN>  The 
Administrative Judge found that in May 1999 Applicant filled out a personnel security questionnaire (hereinafter PSQ) on the 
premises of his future employer as part of a security clearance application process. Applicant felt rushed during the process of 
filling the form out and was disturbed enough by the procedure to mention his feelings to his supervisor.  However, at no time did 
he raise a specific question about the scope or meaning of the questions nor did he offer any corrections or additional information 
prior to the start of his employment.  Applicant answered in the negative a question on the PSQ that asked whether he had used 
marijuana in the last seven years.</P> 
 
<P>In December 1999 Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent.  The DSS agent had received an FBI 
report concerning a DUI arrest of Applicant in 1995 that also involved the police finding marijuana in Applicant's vehicle.  In a 
signed sworn statement, Applicant  stated that it was possible that he smoked marijuana two or three times in the early 1990's but 
he stated categorically that he had not been involved with marijuana since 1995.</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing Applicant first testified that he assumed he may have used marijuana at the time of his 1995 DUI arrest.  Later on in 
his testimony he admitted that he smoked marijuana in a park with some friends the day he was arrested for DUI but some time 
before the actual arrest.</P> 
 
<P>In his decision the Administrative Judge found that Applicant had deliberately concealed his marijuana use when he filled out the 
PSQ in May 1999.  The Judge also found that Applicant conceded his marijuana use "in a fashion" upon confrontation by the DSS 
agent and acknowledged it "ultimately" at the hearing.  The Judge also concluded that the case was not mitigated since  Applicant 
did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.<A HREF="00-0233.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant argues that he did not intentionally falsify the PSQ with regard to marijuana use, and that he made a prompt, 
good-faith effort to correct any omissions before being confronted with the facts.  He reasserts on appeal a theory advanced at the 
hearing, namely that he had forgotten about the 1995 marijuana use at the time he completed the PSQ but had his memory 
refreshed at the time of the meeting with the DSS agent.  He states that once he was shown the arrest records at the interview, he 
did not equivocate and he gave accurate answers.  Although he does not specifically assign error to the Administrative Judge, he 
is, in essence, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to support the Judge's conclusions that Applicant falsified his PSQ and 
that his falsification was not mitigated.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such relevant 
evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same 
record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative 
Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The presence of conflicting record evidence does not 
diminish a Judge's fact-finding responsibility.  When the record contains conflicting evidence, the Judge must carefully weigh the 
evidence in a reasonable, common sense manner and make findings that reflect a reasonable interpretation of the evidence that 
takes into account all the record evidence. <EM> See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0435 (September 22, 2000) at p. 3.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case 
No. 97-0727 (August 3, 1998) at p. 3 ("The Board must consider not only whether there is evidence supporting a Judge's findings, 
but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.").</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate that the Administrative Judge erred.  His appeal brief advances his interpretation of the record 
evidence.  That interpretation is neither conclusive nor is it binding on the Administrative Judge.  Absent a showing that the Judge 
acted in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law, his findings and conclusions will not be disturbed on appeal.  A 
review of the whole record lends support for the Judge's observation that Applicant divulged the extent of his involvement with 
marijuana in 1995 in a piecemeal, incremental fashion which extended from his DSS interview to the hearing.  Applicant omitted 
the 1995 marijuana involvement from his PSQ.  At his DSS interview he stated initially that he had not used or been involved with 
marijuana or illegal drugs in any way during the past seven years.  Later in the interview he told the DSS agent that he had not 
used marijuana since sometime in 1995 but that he was not using nor was he in the possession of marijuana at the time of his 1995 
arrest.  Not until the hearing did Applicant give full and accurate details about the marijuana involvement.  Applicant's actions in 
this regard provided a rational basis for the Judge to conclude that the omission of the 1995 marijuana involvement on the PSQ 
was the product of deliberate concealment rather than faulty memory.  Applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the Judge 
erred in his application of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3.  Nothing in the record evidence indicates that the Judge was 
arbitrary, capricious or acting contrary to law when he concluded that the Applicant's qualified admission of marijuana use during 
a DSS interview six months after the execution of the PSQ was not sufficient to mitigate Applicant's conduct.</P> 
 
<P>2.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that Applicant's falsification of a personnel security questionnaire 
constituted criminal activity that disqualified Applicant for a security clearance.</SPAN>  The SOR contained an allegation that Applicant's 
falsification constituted criminal conduct under Guideline J, namely a violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  On appeal Applicant 
argues that the only conduct that would serve as an appropriate basis for denial of a clearance must be criminal conduct unrelated 
to the execution of the PSQ.  He maintains that the Administrative Judge is not in a position to determine whether or not the 
Applicant's actions constitute criminal conduct as the evidentiary hearing did not afford the Judge proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct.  Applicant states that the reasonable doubt standard could only be satisfied is if 
Applicant admitted to a knowing and willful violation of the law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's arguments regarding Guideline J lack merit.  Any falsification of a form or questionnaire of a government agency 
engaged in an official investigation or inquiry is criminal conduct under the plain meaning of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001 and can be 
alleged under Guideline J without regard to the nature of the underlying conduct that is the subject of the falsification.  Contrary to 
the assertions of Applicant, the act of falsification itself can constitute criminal conduct wholly independent of the criminality of 
the conduct being concealed.</P> 
 
<P>Regarding the burden of proof required to determine criminal conduct, DOHA security clearance adjudications are civil, 
administrative proceedings.  The rules of evidence and burdens of proof associated with criminal proceedings are not applicable in 
these proceedings.  <EM>See Chesna v. U.S. Department of Defense</EM>, 850 F. Supp. 110, 119 (D. Conn. 1994)(DoD need not use 
safeguards afforded criminal defendants in making a security clearance decision "merely because it is based on a determination 
that [the applicant] engaged in conduct which would have constituted a felony").  <EM>See also</EM> DISCR Case No. 93-0386 (April 21, 
1994) at p. 4 (burden of proof in industrial security cases "is lower than that of criminal cases.").  The beyond a reasonable doubt 
standard is not applicable  in these proceedings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.    </P> 
 
<P>A review of the record leads the Board to reject Applicant's contention that there is insufficient evidence for the Administrative 
Judge to find that Applicant's falsification was a violation of federal criminal law.  An admission by Applicant that he engaged in 
willful falsification is not required before the Administrative Judge could find Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. Section 1001 provided 
there is other sufficient evidence that establishes Applicant had the requisite state of mind to establish the criminal act.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-0194 (February 29, 2000) at p. 3 ("An intent to falsify can be shown by circumstantial evidence even in the face 
of denials of any intent to falsify.").  The Administrative Judge had sufficient evidence before him to reasonably conclude that 
Applicant acted willfully when he failed to mention his 1995 marijuana involvement on his PSQ.</P>
