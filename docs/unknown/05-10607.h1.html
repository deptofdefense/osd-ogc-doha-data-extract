<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 25, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could 
not make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="05-10607.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The 
SOR </SPAN>set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted or continued due to foreign influence security concerns. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 19, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On September 18, 2006, I was assigned the case. On September 18, 2006, a 
Notice of Hearing was issued for the hearing held on October 19, 2006.  On October 31, 2006, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns. Applicant admits to the following: his mother, brothers and sisters are citizens and residents of Jordan, 
except one brother who resides in the United Arab Emirate (UAE).  He served mandatory military service in the Royal Jordanian Air Force from 1985 to 
1987.  From 1987 until 1990, Applicant worked for the Royal Jordanian Airlines.  Twenty-three years ago, Applicant received a small inheritance from his 
father. In the last 15 years, he has visited Jordan only three times, 1994, 1998, and 2004.  The last trip, the only one since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, 
was to visit  his sick mother. These admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following 
additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old flight line mechanic who has worked for a defense contractor since February 2003, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. 
Applicant is regarded by those who know him as very conscientious, dependable, reliable, dedicated, hard-working, honest, trustworthy, responsible, 
courteous, and a family oriented person willing to assist others. (App Ex A - G) He is an outstanding asset to his job and a team player. (App Ex J) Having 
been a flight line mechanic for 20 years, Applicant has learned "to do the right thing and the honest thing, the exact thing." (Tr. 30)</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant was born in 1958 in the Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan)--a constitutional monarchy--whose interests are not hostile to the United States. </SPAN>In 1978, 
Applicant--then age 20--came to the U.S. to <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">obtain better educational opportunities</SPAN>.  He came on a student visa to attend flight school.  In 1982, he was 
granted permanent resident alien status.  In April 1999, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">upon completing the required immigration and naturalization citizenship process, Applicant became a 
naturalized United States citizen.  <A HREF="02-31522.h1.html#N_5_"></A>At that time he took his oath of allegiance and was granted his new citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Since becoming an American citizen, Applicant has exercised the rights and privileges, and performed the responsibilities, of a citizen of the United States. 
He obtained, and used, a United States passport. Since becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, he has not accepted any benefits from Jordan and has not used his 
Jordanian citizenship to protect financial or business interests in Jordan.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>In July 1982, he married a U.S. citizen and now has three children ages 22, 16 and 6. They all reside in the U.S.  His oldest son is in college, his second son is 
in high school, and his youngest is in kindergarten. Applicant's first son was born in Jordan when Applicant was there performing his mandatory military 
service.  Since Applicant was married to a U.S. citizen, this son, as well as his two other sons, is a U.S. citizen. Applicant's two youngest sons were born in 
the U.S. </P> 
 
<P>In 1982, Applicant's father died. His mother--now age 80--<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">a widow and former homemaker,</SPAN> is a citizen and resident of Jordan. Applicant has eight siblings: 
five brothers and three sisters who are Jordanian citizens. All live in Jordan except for one brother who lives in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).  In 1994, 
Applicant last saw his brother who lives in the UAE. (Tr. 52) This was the only time he has seen this brother in the past 30 years. (Tr. 32) Applicant last 
talked to his mother by telephone six month ago. (Tr. 33)  He does not talk to his siblings unless they happen to be at his mother's when he calls.  He has 
never sent or received letters or emails from either his mother or his siblings. (Tr. 50)  </P> 
 
<P>His brother living in the UAE is an inspector for the fire department.  Another brother works for the water department and another was studying to be a 
lawyer.  One sister is a retired school teacher and the other two are housewives. (Tr. 55) One of his sisters is married to a school teacher, another to a 
surveyor, and the last to a military member.  He last saw his siblings in 2004 when he visited his mother. (Tr. 37)</P> 
 
<P>When his father was alive, he owned a small general store, which did not include real estate, and an interest in a bus company. Both are still in business. The 
bus company is "barely making enough money to support the maintenance on the buses." (Tr. 59)   When his father died, his father's estate was divided 
equally between Applicant, his mother, and his eight siblings.  In 1978, Applicant last saw the businesses which are run by his brothers. (Tr. 57) Applicant 
does not participate in the management or operation of the businesses and has never received any income or dividends from the businesses.</P> 
 
<P>In 1985, Applicant returned to Jordan to serve his two years of obligatory military service.  He worked on fuel tanks and air frames for the Royal Jordanian 
Air Force and was paid approximately $50 per month.  In 1987, he completed his mandatory service and obtained a job with the Royal Jordanian Airlines. He 
worked for the Royal Jordanian Airlines until 1990 when he returned to the U.S. Applicant spent the month of August 1998 in Jordan.  In 2004, he also 
visited his mother in Jordan traveling on his U.S. passport.</P> 
 
<P>In 1996, Applicant was release from work due to an unanticipated slowdown in the company's workload. (App Ex K)  From January 2000 until December 
2000, Applicant was laid off from work due to the company's lack of work. (App Ex H)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant owns three houses in the U.S.  He and his family live in one and he is repairing the other two to be used for rental income. (Tr. 60) The fair market 
value of the three houses is $300,000. He has $17,000 in his company retirement program. (Tr. 61) </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I take administrative notice of the following facts: although Jordan, a constitutional monarchy, opposed the U.S. position regarding the war in Iraq, it has 
consistently followed a pro-Western foreign policy and has traditionally maintained close relations with the U.S. While Hamas, an Islamic extremist group, 
operates in Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East, <A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></A>there is no evidence that the government has assisted the group or concurs in its actions. </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: MGBHM P+ Times New" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> Department 
Counsel acknowledges that there is no evidence Jordan is active in espionage against the U.S. </SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a 
conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy 
guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline B, foreign influence.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
an applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant 
which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  
Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which 
indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or 
trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once 
the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate government's case.  Additionally, an 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-10607.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. Under the Foreign Influence guideline, a security risk may 
exist when an individual's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the U.S., 
reside in a foreign country, or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise 
of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they 
make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure. Applicant's mother and eight siblings are citizens of Jordan. All live in Jordan 
except one brother who lives in the UAE. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 (E2.A2.1.2.1  <EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is uncontroverted that Applicant's mother and eight siblings, persons to whom he has close ties of affection, are citizens and residents of Jordan, and one 
sibling a citizen of Jordan, resides in the UAE. Those simple facts, standing alone, are sufficient to raise security concerns over the possibility of Applicant's 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, 
disqualifying under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">B.<A HREF="05-10607.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> F</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">amily ties with persons in a foreign country does raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, 
extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">or continue a 
security clearance for the applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole. Common sense suggests that the stronger the ties 
of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is improperly influenced or is 
brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole 
in deciding if the facts and circumstances of an applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable security concern under Guideline B. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant does not maintain regular contact with his family.  He last visited Jordan in 2004, at which time he last saw his mother and some of his siblings. 
This was his only visit after becoming a U.S. citizen.  This was the last time he spoke with any of his siblings.  He last talked with his mother six months ago.  
He does not exchange letters or emails with his mother or siblings.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and specifically considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (<EM>A determination 
that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a 
foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States), </EM>and conclude it does not apply.  Applicant's two brothers are low-level government employees.  One works for the fire department 
and the other for the water department.  Additionally, his brother-in-law is in the Jordanian military, who's rank is unknown.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">I have considered FI MC E2.A2.1.3.2. (<EM>Contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent), </EM>and conclude it does apply even 
though there is a rebuttable presumption that a relation with a mother and siblings is not casual or infrequent. Having last talked with his mother six months 
ago, Applicant does not maintain close or regular contact with his mother or siblings.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Even if this mitigating factor is inapplicable</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense 
evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of those family ties. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. 
The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" 
concept. It recognizes that a person should be viewed by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on 
its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In assessing whether an applicant is vulnerable to exploitation through relatives in a foreign country, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the 
character of the government of the relevant foreign country.  Jordan is pro-Western and has close relations with the U.S.  There is no evidence Jordan is 
active in espionage against the U.S.  It is important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives in Jordan. Applicant's mother is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a widow 
and former homemaker.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> There is no evidence she or his siblings have the means or the power to leave the country. Under these circumstances, there is some 
opportunity for adverse influence against Applicant's relatives in Jordan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant served two years of mandatory military service with the Royal Jordanian Air Force.  His service ended nine years before he became a U.S. citizen 
and 16 years before the hearing. It is not a security concern for a foreign citizen to serve in a foreign military.  Foreign Preference MC 2 (E2.A3.1.3.2. 
<EM>Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship</EM>) applies to his mandatory foreign 
military service.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.d.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Following his mandatory military service, Applicant worked as mechanic for the Royal Jordanian Airlines. Again, this service occurred before he became a 
U.S. citizen.  It is not a security concern for a foreign citizen to work for a foreign company before that person becomes a U.S. citizen.  I find for Applicant as 
to SOR 1.e.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Twenty-three-years ago, Applicant received a 1/9th interest in his father's estate.  Since inheriting his interest, Applicant has never received compensation 
from that interest.  Applicant is not involved in the management of the store or the bus company.  The bus company only makes enough money to maintain 
the buses. Applicant owns a home in the U.S., and two other houses, which he is repairing to use as rental property.  The fair market value of his real estate in 
the U.S. is $300,000.  He has a retirement fund through his company in the U.S.  All of his financial accounts are in the U.S.  MC 5 (E2.A2.1.3.5. <EM>Foreign 
financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>) applies.  I find for Applicant as to SOR 1.f.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and has lived in this country since 1990. All his immediate family members, including his wife and sons, live in the 
U.S. and are citizens. The vast majority of his assets are in this country. He receives no income from his 1/9th share in the businesses in Jordan.  He has 
worked for a defense contractor for several years. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has limited connection to his relatives in Jordan and has significant ties to the United States. He 
has made only one trip to Jordan since becoming a U.S. citizen.  Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, Applicant's 
significant attachment to his wife and children in the United States and to the United States, itself,  I have determined that his mother and siblings, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">their 
citizenship and residency status</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> do not constitute an unacceptable security risk. Based on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">the totality of the evidence in this case, and Applicant's evidence of 
extenuation and explanation that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided 
for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
