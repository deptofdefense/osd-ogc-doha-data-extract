<P>Applicant's illegal use of marijuana from January 1996 to 1999, and on one occasion in January 2004 after submitting an application for a security clearance, 
raises a concern about his judgment. His deliberate omission of his use of LSD in 1996 and 1999 raise further security concerns. Clearance is denied.<BR>

<P><STRONG>STATEMENT OF CASE</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On July 19, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges 
security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement;  Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On July 27, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  Applicant elected to have his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel 
submitted the government's file of relevant material (FORM) on January 24, 2006. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on January 27, 2006, and received on 
February 3, 2006. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not 
respond. The case was assigned to me on March 17, 2006. <BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is  25 years old and is a vocational student with a defense contractor. He is an apprentice with an electric company. He submitted a security clearance 
application on November 13, 2003.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He admits to all of the allegations in the SOR.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Between January 1996 to 1999 while in high school, Applicant used marijuana approximately 20 times.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>   In January 2004, Applicant used marijuana at a 
birthday party.  Some friends were using  marijuana and he took a hit off the marijuana cigarette.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  He used LSD once in 1996 and once in 1999. He purchased 
LSD for his own personal use in 1999.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>On June 12, 2000, Applicant was arrested for Open Container.  He was found guilty and ordered to perform 10 hours of community service and pay $100 in 
fines and court costs.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In approximately 2002, Applicant manufactured a false identification card for an underage friend so he could purchase alcohol.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In response to question 27 on his November 13, 2003, security clearance application "Your Use Of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity - Use of Illegal Drugs", 
Applicant answered "Yes" and listed marijuana use on approximately 20 occasions from 1996 to 1998.  He did not list his LSD use in 1996 and 1999.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He did 
not list his LSD use because he did not want to jeopardize his employment.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In the past three years, Applicant has worked in high security areas. He has not used any illegal substances since January 2004 and does not intend to do so in 
the future.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position &hellip; that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Guideline H - Drug Involvement:  Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that a person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct:  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance."<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about the 
person.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> <BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts admitted by 
the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.  The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for 
issuing a clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a prima facie case for disqualification under 
Guidelines H, E, and J.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's recreational use of illegal drugs while in high school raise a security concern. Between 1996 and 1999, he used marijuana approximately 20 times 
and LSD on two occasions. The drug involvement security concern is heightened further by his decision to use marijuana at a party in January 2004, after he 
had been granted an interim security clearance in December 2003. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The following Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DI DC) apply to Applicant's case.  DI DC E2.A8.1.2.1: (Any drug abuse) applies due to his past 
history of illegal drug use. DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2: (Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution) applies 
with respect to his possession of illegal drugs and his purchase of LSD in 1999 for his personal use.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The drug involvement concern can be mitigated. However, I find none of the mitigating conditions apply.  Applicant's last use of illegal drugs was after he had 
submitted his security clearance application.  This shows a lack of judgment.  His last drug involvement was recent.  The illegal drug use was not an isolated or 
an aberrational event since he used illegal drugs on several occasions between 1996 to January 2004.  Although he has indicated he does not intend to use 
illegal drugs in the future, it is too soon to conclude that he will follow through on his intentions considering the recency of his 2004 marijuana use.  I find 
against Applicant under Guideline H.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant deliberately falsified his security clearance application when he failed to list his LSD use in 1996 and 1999.  He did not list his LSD use because he 
was afraid he would lose his job.</P> 
 
<P>Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2: (The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies with respect to his deliberate omission 
of his LSD use on his security clearance application.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5: (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the 
agency) applies with respect to Applicant's manufacture of a false identification card for his underage friend in 2002 and his falsification of his security 
clearance.  Both actions indicate a certain element of dishonesty and are rule violations.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I find none of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions apply.  Applicant's conduct raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. 
There is nothing in the record evidence which indicates he made an effort to correct the falsification on his security clearance application before being 
confronted with the facts.  I find against Applicant under Guideline E.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's deliberate falsification of his security clearance application violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, a felony.  The statute states it is a criminal offense to 
knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation or knowingly make or use a false writing in any matter 
within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of 
the Government of the United States.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Information is material if it would affect a final agency decision or, if incorrect, would impede a thorough and 
complete investigation of an applicant's background.<A HREF="05-03429.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Applicant knowingly and willfully falsified his security clearance application by failing to list he had 
used LSD on two occasions in 1996 and 1999. An applicant's history of illegal drug use is relevant and material to a determination of his security worthiness. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was also arrested in June 2000 for Open Container. Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: (Allegations or admission of 
criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) applies 
in this case.  None of the mitigating conditions under Criminal Conduct apply due to the recency of falsifying his 2003 security clearance application.  The 
criminal conduct was not isolated and it is too soon to conclude that Applicant is successfully rehabilitated.  I find against Applicant under Guideline J.     <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national 
interests. I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by the drug involvement, personal conduct, and criminal conduct concern. 
Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security 
clearance. <BR>

<P><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG><BR>

</P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:<BR>
