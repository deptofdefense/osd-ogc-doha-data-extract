<P>Obtaining German citizenship and passport by a native-born U.S. citizen, who finds the murder of many of his Jewish maternal relatives during the Holocaust repugnant

</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 13, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated March 9, 2001, the 
Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on May 14, 2001, and a notice of hearing was issued on June 4, 2001.  </SPAN>The undersigned held a 
hearing on June 27, 2001<A NAME="date (s) of hearing(s)"></A>.  The Department Counsel presented four exhibits ("exhs"), but no witnesses.  The Applicant's case consisted of the presentation of one exhibit 
and the testimony of a witness besides his own testimony.  Two additional documents were submitted by the Applicant and were admitted without objection on July 11, 
2001.  The record in this case closed on July 11, 2001.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the transcript ("tr") of the hearing on July 6, 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two guidelines: paragraph 1, Guideline C (foreign preference), and paragraph 2, 
Guideline B (foreign influence).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the 
same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 31-year-old software engineer employed by a U.S. Government contractor since July 1998.  Tr page 99.  The Applicant seeks to retain a Secret 
personnel security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's father was born in the United States in July 1933 of American parents and grandparents;<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> the Applicant's father volunteered to serve in the U.S. Navy in 
the Korean War.  Tr page 40.  The Applicant's mother was born in Germany in February 1939.  Because she was a Jew, she was denied German citizenship under then-existing German law and was forced to flee for her life to the United States as an infant with her mother.  Her father (the Applicant's maternal grandfather) had already 
fled to the United States.  Exh. 2.  Many of the Applicant's enate relatives were killed by the German government in the Holocaust.  Tr page 37; SOR answer.  The 
Applicant's mother and his maternal grandfather became U.S. citizens.  The Applicant's parents each did their Ph.D. work in London.  Exh. 3.  The Applicant himself was 
born in the United States in November 1969 and is a U.S. citizen.</P> 
 
<P>In February 1973, the Applicant's family moved to Australia.  His parents were employed as university professors (psychology and mechanical engineering) in Australia, 
but are now retired.  Tr page 64.  They have never done any research or other work for the Australian Defence Department or for any other foreign government. Exh. B; 
exh. 3;  tr pages 50, 66.  The Applicant's parents are dual U.S.-Australian citizens, while his maternal grandfather, now 92 years old and living in an Australian nursing 
home, has remained solely a U.S. citizen.  Tr pages 62, 65; exh. 3.  The Applicant has one brother, born in Australia in 1973, who was educated and lives in the United 
States and is a U.S. citizen.  Tr pages 38, 51, 67.  The Applicant's father spends about six months annually in the United States where he has many American family 
connections.  Tr pages 39, 51-52, 61, 65-66.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant himself was raised in Australia from the age of three (1973) through the end of high school in December 1987.  He visited the United States with his parents 
on sabbatical in 1978 and again in 1982.  He never served in Australian military service nor has he ever been an Australian national, and has no obligations in those 
regards.  Exh. 2.  In August 1988 at age 18 the Applicant moved to the United States.  He attended college and graduate school in the United States, graduating with a 
master's degree in electrical engineering in May 1994.  He worked for a major U.S. firm in 1994-98, holding a security clearance, before accepting his present position.  
Tr pages 91, 102-103.  He has not lived in any country other than Australia and the United States--although he has traveled extensively.<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He has never married; his girl 
friend lives in the United States as well as his agnate relatives and several friends from college and graduate school.  Tr pages 29, 39, 52, 62-67, 84-85; exh. 2.  He 
currently mentors a child as a "big brother" in the United States.  Tr page 67.  He has no significant direct financial interests abroad except shares in a large Japanese 
corporation traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  Tr pages 39-40; exh. 2; SOR answer. </P> 
 
<P>When the Applicant's mother visited a relative in Israel in 1996, she learned that Germany had amended its naturalization laws to permit persons who had been denied or 
stripped of their German nationality under Nazi rule to have their nationality "reinstated" upon application as some sort of reparations or compensation gesture.  The 
amendment also allowed children of such persons to similarly apply for German citizenship.  The application process did not require any oath or other allegiance to 
Germany nor did it entail travel to or residence in Germany or any other civic obligations with or to Germany.  Although his mother did not want to live in Germany for 
obvious reasons,<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> she thought she might want to live sometime in England where she and her husband had done their Ph.D. work and have fond memories.  Citizenship in 
any European Union (EU) country, <EM>e.g. </EM>Germany, would facilitate English residence in that event.  She applied for and obtained German citizenship in 1998 and 
encouraged her sons to do likewise.  Exhs. 2 and 3; SOR answer.</P> 
 
<P>However, the Applicant in 1998 held a Secret personnel security clearance and was just transferring from his former position to his present job.  Tr pages 102-103.  He 
did the prudent thing and asked the Facility Security Officer (FSO) of the latter firm whether there could be any objection--from the point of view of his continuing 
security clearance--to an application for German citizenship.  He was told in August 1998 by the FSO, who himself first checked with the employer's Defense Security 
Service (DSS) lead investigator, that a number of dual nationals have security clearances and that there should be no problem for the Applicant.  The FSO said that he 
would have to file a routine adverse information report with the DSS if and when German citizenship had been formally conferred upon the Applicant.  SOR answer; exh. 
2; tr pages 35-36, 56, 90-92, 94-96.  The Applicant would not have applied for German citizenship "if [he] had not first been told that it would pose no problems with 
retaining [his] security clearance."  SOR answer, page 3; exh. 2.  The FSO testified credibly that the Applicant "was very aware of his Government security clearance.  
And the reason he had come to me was that he did not want to pursue this if it in any way this affected his ability to retain his Government clearance."  Tr page 91.  </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant applied in person for German citizenship by completing the necessary forms at a German consulate in the United States in October 1998, and it was 
granted in December 1998.  Exh. 2; tr pages 47, 55.  In January 1999 the Applicant gave the FSO a copy of the formal document recognizing the Applicant's German 
citizenship, and the FSO told him that he would file the adverse information report with DSS promptly, which in turn could result in an interview with a DSS agent.  In fact, 
the Applicant was twice interviewed later that year by the same DSS lead investigator who had provided advice<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> to the FSO in August 1998.  Tr pages 92, 101-102.  
The adverse information report, together with a copy of the December 1998 German document, was filed with DSS in January 1999.  Exh. 1.  The Applicant then applied 
for a German passport valid for ten years "figuring that there are some countries that allow you in without a visa if you're from Germany, but not from the U.S., it might be 
useful at some time."<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Tr pages 38, 58.  He has no plans to move to Europe.  SOR answer, tr pages 37, 80-82.  The passport was issued in April 1999, was never 
used, and was cancelled<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> in the spring of 2001 by the Applicant after he had received the SOR and the Assistant Secretary of Defense (C<SUP>3</SUP>I) memorandum of August 
2000 and had consulted with the FSO.  Exh. A; tr pages 30-31, 96-97.  The Applicant responded to the SOR and the ASD (C<SUP>3</SUP>I) memorandum by informing DOHA--</P> 
 
<P>Now that the guidelines regarding dual citizenship have apparently changed, I am willing to change my earlier decision in order to retain my security clearance.  I am in the 
process of voiding and relinquishing my German passport and am investigating the process for denouncing German citizenship.  If it were deemed absolutely necessary, I 
would be willing to renounce the German citizenship.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant recognizes that a conditional willingness to renounce dual citizenship is much less persuasive of an absence of foreign preference than is a declared intent to 
pursue renunciation forthwith.  He has never been told that renunciation is "absolutely necessary in order to keep [his] clearance."  Tr pages 49-50, 60-61, 75-84.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant applied for German citizenship, as his mother did, in order to have the opportunity to live in England, where he has friends from Australia, or elsewhere in 
European Union countries other than Germany, such as France or Spain, though the prospects for moving to the EU are purely speculative.  Tr pages 37, 79-80, 86.  
However, he would never live in Germany because that country's murder of many of his Jewish relatives and its history of pogroms are clearly repugnant to him.  The 
transcript is replete with expression of his repugnance.  <EM>See</EM> tr pages 29, 69-70, 85-88.  The Government's professed concern that this Applicant has a preference for 
Germany is unfounded on the record.<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The Applicant has no financial accounts in Germany, never served in its military, has no military or civic obligations with or to 
Germany, has never voted in any foreign election, has never sought political office in a foreign country, and has never been unduly detained or incarcerated by any customs 
or immigration officers in his travels.  Exh. 2.</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  
The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance (Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may 
be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant 
adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>GUIDELINE C - FOREIGN PREFERENCE</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide 
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>    [1st] The exercise of dual citizenship;</P> 
 
<P>    [2nd] Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence 
that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    [1st] An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    [1st] A determination that the immediate family mem-ber(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not 
agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved 
and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    [5th] Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-able participation</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon 
an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the 
Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations under the 
Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and 
established under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard without departing from the 
'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the 
emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum 
<STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial evidence but something less than 
a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, 
extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's case is not refuted, and further assuming it 
can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the applicant has a 
heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold a security clearance.<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of those who testified, 
the undersigned concludes that the Applicant successfully rebutted and overcame the Government's case with regard to Guidelines C and B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>DC #1 (guideline C), identified on page 6 <EM>supra</EM>, does not provide that dual citizenship <EM>ipso facto</EM> could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying.  Rather, it is the 
<STRONG>exercise</STRONG> of dual citizenship that could raise such a concern.  Here, the Applicant exercised a right under German law to obtain German citizenship and passport.<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  
Although he did not use the latter, his possession alone of such a foreign passport falls within the scope of DC #2, which is also identified on page 6 <EM>supra</EM>.  In mitigation, 
he checked with and followed the advice of his FSO, an authorized personnel security official: (a) before he applied for German citizenship, (b) when he had obtained it, 
and (c) after he received the ASD (C<SUP>3</SUP>I) memorandum of August 2000.  This falls within the scope of the guidance in the Directive (E2.2.5) that the adjudicator should 
consider whether the person: voluntarily reported the information, was truthful and complete in responding to questions, and sought assistance and followed professional 
guidance, where appropriate.  He changed his decision to get a German passport when he read the ASD (C<SUP>3</SUP>I) memorandum<A HREF="01-03122.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and took prompt steps to surrender the 
passport.  Since he is not required by any written or oral guidance from any authoritative source to renounce his German citizenship itself, he has not done so, but is 
conditionally prepared to do so.  This falls within the scope of MC #4, which is set forth on page 6 <EM>supra</EM>.  As a factual matter, the Applicant does not have a foreign 
preference for Germany, but an active dislike of Germany.  His plans to move or travel to another EU country are presently speculative.  He loves America--where he 
was born and where he chose to live, work, and form social and financial ties--and is proud of America's strength and protective role in the world.  SOR &para; 1 (foreign 
preference) is concluded favorably to the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant has immediate family members and other persons to whom he has close ties of affection who are citizens of, or resident in, foreign countries.  This falls 
within the scope of DC #1 under Guideline B, which is identified on page 6 <EM>supra</EM>.  However, based on all the evidence in the record, the Applicant's father, mother, and 
brother are neither agents of any foreign power nor are they in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between 
loyalty to the persons involved and the United States.  Corroborating evidence to that effect is not in all circumstances required in order to find admissible evidence 
persuasive. <EM> See also </EM>tr pages 109, 116-120.  SOR &para; 2 (foreign influence) is concluded favorably to the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative process discussion at 
enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on page 7 <EM>supra</EM>.  Obtaining foreign citizenship and a foreign passport by a native-born American is serious, but 
is mitigated by the surrounding circumstances, surrender of the passport, and the Applicant's motivation that negatives foreign preference.</P>

and/or use of a foreign passport."  Tr page 98; exh. 4.
