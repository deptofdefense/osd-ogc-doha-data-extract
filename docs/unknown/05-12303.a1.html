<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On January 19, 2006, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the 
basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant 
requested a hearing.  On June 27, 2006, after the hearing,  Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.<A HREF="05-12303.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant appealed the Judge's 
unfavorable clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.  Rather, it contains new evidence, in the form of a letter from Applicant's bankruptcy attorney, which 
confirms that the debts listed in the SOR are included in Applicant's Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, and that Applicant continues to make timely payments in accordance with the plan.  The Board 
cannot consider this new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.29.</P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board's authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has alleged the Judge committed harmful error.  It does not review cases <EM>de novo</EM>. Applicant has not 
made an allegation of harmful error.   Therefore, the decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.</P>
