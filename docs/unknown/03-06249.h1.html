<P>Applicant has delinquent debts and unpaid taxes that he has done little to satisfy. He deliberately failed to file income tax returns, and pay the federal and state 
income taxes he owed for the 2000-03 tax years. He has failed to mitigate the financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns that exist in this 
case. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On January 10, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was 
received by DOHA on March 8, 2005, requested a hearing, and admitted all Guideline F allegations, except subparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i., and denied all 
Guideline J allegations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on July 27, 2005, scheduling the hearing for August 16, 2005. The hearing was 
conducted as scheduled. The government submitted eight documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8, and admitted into the 
record without objection. On my motion, without objection from either party, administrative notice was taken of 26 U.S.C. &sect; 7203 and C.R.S.&sect; 39-22-621. 
Applicant testified, called one witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted a large binder containing dozens of documents that was marked as Applicant's 
Exhibit (AE) 1, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on August 25, 2005.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to some of the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is  44 years old and has been employed as a technical writer by a defense contractor since January 2004. He was employed by a temporary agency and 
placed with the same defense contractor from September 2003 until January 2004. Applicant has been married since December 1983, and has three sons, ages 
20, 19, and 16. He received a general educational development (GED) certificate in January 1979, was awarded a bachelor of science degree in information 
systems in 1988, and a master of science degree in project management and information technology in March 2005. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from November 1979 until he retired in November 1999, as a Technical Sergeant (paygrade E-6). He held  
a top secret clearance during most of his military career, and no adverse action was ever taken to remove or downgrade that clearance. Following his retirement, 
Applicant was employed in the telecommunications industry from September 1999<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> until he was laid off in January 2002. He was unemployed from January 
2002 until October 2002, and then worked as a substitute teacher until May 2003. He was unemployed from May 2003 until June 2003, at which time he began 
working at a convenience store. He quit the convenience store job in August 2003 after someone was shot in the parking lot of the store, and remained 
unemployed until he was placed with his present employer by the temporary agency in September 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The testimony and numerous documents that Applicant submitted establish he had a very successful military career during which his performance was 
commendable. He has performed well in his civilian employment and is deemed to be a solid performer. He has earned a reputation for being honest, 
dependable, and trustworthy. Many of the letters of recommendation are from people who have known Applicant professionally for substantial periods of time, 
and each of them emphatically state they cannot think of any reason why Applicant should be considered a security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges Applicant has nine accounts, totaling more than $23,000.00, that have either been submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts. 
Applicant admits liability for all of the debts, except the $1,803.38 tuition alleged as owing in subparagraph 1.h., and the $500.00 hospital bill alleged in 
subparagraph 1.i. As to the tuition debt, he claims that debt had to be paid by him before he would have been allowed to depart one of his USAF active duty 
stations. However, he testified he is willing to pay the university the $1,200.00 portion of the debt that is actual tuition, but not the remainder which represents 
accrued interest. He testified the hospital bill was for treatment provided his mother-in-law who now resides outside the country, and that he has paid most of 
the bill for that treatment, but the hospital will not provide him with sought after documentation about the $500.00 unpaid balance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant claims to have made one payment on the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a., one $100.00 payment on the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c., and 
several $500.00 payments on the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d. He also testified he is continuing to make $100.00 per month payments on the debt alleged 
in subparagraph 1.d. However, and despite having organized and put together the impressive collection of documents contained in AE 1, he was unable to 
present receipts or other documentation in support of the alleged payments.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant failed to file his personal federal or state income tax returns for the 2000-03 tax years in a timely fashion, and did not file them at all until March 
2005, following issuance of the SOR. The SOR alleges Applicant is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of $15,000.00 for unpaid taxes, 
penalties, and interest for those years. AE 1, tab 2, discloses his actual past due tax liability for those years is over $48,000.00. The SOR alleges Applicant is 
indebted for state income taxes in the amount of $4,000.00 for unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest for those same years. Applicant estimates his actual liability 
is closer to $5,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant testified he failed to file the tax returns and pay the taxes alleged because he was earning twice as much money as he had earned while on active duty, 
failed to have adequate amounts withheld from his pay, and did not have the money to pay the taxes when they were due. He denies deliberately failing to file 
the returns and pay the taxes, claiming he had filed for extensions and intended to file the returns and pay the taxes when he was financially able to do so. 
However, he admitted at the hearing that he prepared and filed separate returns for his wife in each of those years, and neither filed his own separate return nor a 
joint return that included his income in order to obtain the refund they received by claiming only his wife's income.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant testified and submitted the documents in AE 1, tab 2 in support of his claim that he is now working to resolve the delinquent federal tax liability. 
However, he also acknowledged that the IRS Form 433-F (Collection Information Statement) had not actually been submitted as of the date of the hearing. He 
has taken no steps to resolve the delinquent state taxes. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributes the beginning of his financial problems to a serious automobile accident he was involved in back in 1993 that left him in a coma for a 
couple of weeks and physically disabled for several months. While he was on active duty in the Air Force with all medical expenses paid by the government and 
his pay continuing during his convalescence, he claims his wife did not properly handle the family finances during that time causing him to get behind with 
some debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He blames his reassignment to the United States in 1997, following several overseas tours of duty, for his continuing financial difficulties. Although all moving 
expenses and relocation allowances for he and his family were paid for by the government, Applicant testified he had to spend about $15,000.00 to rent a house, 
acquire furniture and an auto, and on other miscellaneous expenses. He claims his finances took another serious hit when he had to spend about $3,000 when 
his mother died in 1998, and an additional $7,000.00 when he became the conservator for a mentally handicapped niece at about the same time. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While Applicant blames some of his financial problems to the problems and expenses he encountered during the mid-1990s, he also attributes his failure to pay 
income taxes in the early-2000s to the fact that his annual family income increased from approximately $40,000.00 in 1998, his last full year of active duty, to 
over $80,000.00 in 2001, the first year he failed to submit a tax return. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The IRS Form 433-F Applicant submitted in AE 1, tab 2, discloses his combined family monthly net income is $4,643.00, and the family monthly living 
expenses, including payments on two of the debts alleged in the SOR, are about $4,200.00.<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Also included in AE 1, tab 2, is a document Applicant prepared 
listing his family debt. Including the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant reports his total outstanding debt to be $86,145.00. His </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Action Plan to Address Debt</EM>, 
also contained in AE 1, tab 2, is to establish repayment plans for past due federal and state taxes, order credit reports, contact creditors and either clear 
erroneous entries or establish repayment planes, and apply for part-time teaching positions to generate a bit more income.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
financial considerations, and Guideline J, criminal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a

of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P>

to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.  An</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an 
individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving 
responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has numerous accounts, totaling tens of thousands of dollars, including federal and state income taxes, that have been seriously delinquent for a 
number of years. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply in this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial troubles are at least partially attributable to his unanticipated loss of employment in January 2002, and unemployment or 
underemployment from that time until he returned to steady full-time employment in September 2003. However, considering the number of years that passed 
between the incidents in the 1990s he attributed to some of his financial problems, and the substantial increase in pay he experienced between the last incident 
and his January 2002 unemployment, I do not find they are at all responsible for his present financial condition. Accordingly, Applicant is entitled to application 
of Mitigating Condition (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM> to his case only for those events occurring after January 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While Applicant's failure to properly plan for his increased tax liability for the 2000 tax year is somewhat understandable; his failure to take immediate steps to 
resolve the problem by increasing his withholdings or otherwise setting aside funds to pay his taxes for future years is not. Instead, Applicant continued to allow 
his tax withholdings to be insufficient through at least the 2003 tax year, and did nothing to resolve any of his delinquent taxes until after the SOR was issued. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Further, while Applicant claims to have made some payments on some debts alleged in the SOR, he has not submitted documentation in support of those 
claims. Finally, the only information Applicant has presented of any plan to deal with his financial condition, is assertions of what he intends to do in the future 
to either arrange repayment plans or challenge his liability on certain debts, and seek additional sources of income. Applicant is not entitled to application of 
any other mitigating condition to his case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant violated 26 U.S.C. &sect; 7203, thereby committing a misdemeanor criminal offense, by willfully failing to file federal tax returns for the  2000-03 tax 
years. His actions in filing separate returns for his wife to obtain refunds, while neither filing his own separate returns nor filing a joint return that included his 
income, clearly demonstrates that his failure to file returns for those years was willful. DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>applies. The 
statute alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.e. through 1.h., C.R.S. &sect; 39-22-621, is not a criminal statute, and therefore Applicant's conduct as alleged under those 
subparagraphs does not create any additional Guideline J concerns.<A HREF="03-06249.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> I have considered all potentially mitigating conditions and conclude that none apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations and criminal conduct security 
concerns that exist in this case. He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guidelines F and J are decided against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
