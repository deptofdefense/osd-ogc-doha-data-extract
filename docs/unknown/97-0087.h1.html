<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>On February 21, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense Industrial</EM>
<EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as amended by
Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it was clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</P>

<P>  </P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	Applicant's undated answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on March 25, 1997.  In it,
he requested that his case be decided without a hearing.  Applicant received the Government's File
of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of seven exhibits on May 5, 1997.  He did not respond to
the Government's FORM.  The case record was closed on June 4, 1997, and assigned to this DOHA
Administrative Judge for decision on the same date. </P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	In his answer to the Statement of Reasons, Applicant admitted all factual allegations set forth
under paragraph 1 (Criterion K) and under paragraph 2 (Criterion E).  After a complete and thorough
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following
additional findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is 62 years old and has held a secret clearance since 1984.  The record does not
disclose the length of time he has worked for Company X, the defense contractor who is his current
employer.  His title and responsibilities at the time of the misconduct alleged in the SOR were vice
president and facility security officer (FSO). </P>

<P>	Applicant's suitability to retain his security clearance is in question because as FSO of
Company X, he knowingly and willfully failed to follow the security requirements prescribed by the
Industrial Security Manual for Safeguarding Classified Information - DoD 5220.22M, dated January
1991 (ISM) and by the National Industrial Security Operating Manual - DoD 5220.22M, dated
January 1995 (NISPOM).  </P>

<P>	Beginning on an undisclosed date in 1992, Applicant allowed two uncleared employees (Mr.
A and Mr. B) access to classified information at Company X's principal place of business.  In
addition, he prepared numerous classified visit letters (CVL's) for each of them which authorized
them to access classified information at government facilities and at facilities operated by other
defense contractors.  Both Mr. A and Mr. B had completed security questionnaires at the time they
began working for Company X, but Applicant (the FSO) was preoccupied with other work and did
not submit their paperwork to the Department of Defense for processing.</P>

<P>	More recently in May 1996, Applicant allowed Mr. C (an uncleared Company X employee)
to process classified information on a Company network analyzer.  He did not think he was violating
security regulations because he had turned off the monitor display so Mr. C could not see the
frequencies which were being tested.</P>

<P>	When Applicant was questioned by the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) on November
13, 1996, he readily admitted his responsibility for several security violations. In a signed, sworn
statement (FORM Item # 7), he admitted that he "knowingly and willingly allowed (Mr. A) access
to information that he had no clearance for."  He admitted that he had "willfully generated and sent
a falsified classified visit letter" which allowed Mr. A to visit a facility in another state.  As if to
further explain, he added "I knew it was wrong and that it was a security violation for (Mr. A) to
have access to classified information but I did it anyway."  In the same statement, he admitted that
he had allowed Mr. B access to classified information when he "knew (Mr. B) did not have a security
clearance.  And he admitted that he had "willfully generated a falsified CVL" to enable this
employee to visit another defense contractor.</P>

<P>	Applicant attributes his failure to observe security procedures to job-related stress.  He was
overwhelmed by the multiple responsibilities he had assumed in a company which was experiencing
serious cash-flow problems because of a shrinking market for its products.  His statement to the
DIS--in addition to being an admission of wrongdoing--is also an attempt by Applicant to
understand (for himself) what had gone wrong, why he had been so overwhelmed, and why it
became impossible for him to fulfill all of his responsibilities.  He acknowledges that he was aware
of security regulations from reading the ISM and NISPON, and also from visits and inspections by
the Industrial Security Representative.</P>

<P>	The record discloses that Company X has hired another FSO since these violations occurred. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward
making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the interests of
national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations, Administrative Judges
must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only
with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context of the factors set forth in
section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the burden of proving
any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate that the facts proven have a
nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P>

<P>	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</P>

<P><CENTER></CENTER>
</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>SECURITY VIOLATIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><CENTER>(Criterion K)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness,
willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(1) 	Unauthorized disclosure of classified information;</P>

<P>	(2)	Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include actions that:</STRONG></P>

<P>	None Applicable</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>PERSONAL CONDUCT</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P><CENTER>(Criterion E)</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness
to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard
classified information.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</STRONG></P>

<P>	(5)	A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</P>

<P>	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>None Applicable</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the Statement
of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant
to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the
disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against an applicant.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria K and E.</P>

<P>	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion K.  In both his signed,
sworn statement to the DIS, and in his response to the allegations in the SOR, Applicant has
admitted that he knowingly and willfully committed security violations.  While serving as FSO for
Company X, he allowed two uncleared employees access to classified information on numerous
occasions over a four year period.  On several occasions, he prepared classified visit letters for these
employees which authorized them to visit and access classified information at other facilities.  More
recently, he allowed a third uncleared employee access to classified information by having him
process this information on company equipment.  Applicant knew what he was doing on each
occasion, and he knew that he was violating security regulations.</P>

<P>	Applicant receives little benefit from the mitigating considerations in the Directive's
Adjudicative Guidelines.  His actions were not inadvertent because he admits that he "willfully
provided classified information to two uncleared individuals."  As the FSO for Company X, he knew
that uncleared employees should not have access to classified information.  His actions were not
isolated or infrequent; he allowed uncleared employees access to classified information on different
occasions and under different circumstances over a four year period.  And Applicant's violations of
security regulations were not caused by improper or inadequate training.  He admits that he was
familiar with the ISM and NISPOM,  that he had a working knowledge of security requirements, and
that he had been briefed by a Industrial Security Representative annually.</P>

<P>	In his signed, sworn statement to the DIS, Applicant stated his intention to hire a "full time
FSO" with experience.  An attachment to his answer (to the SOR) confirms that a new FSO has been
hired. </P>

<P>	Consideration has been given to the circumstances under which the violations occurred. 
Applicant has painted a convincing portrait of a very difficult work environment in which he had
assumed an array of responsibilities that were almost impossible for him to fulfill. The record fails
to disclose how, when, and why the situation deteriorated to the point that it had when the security
violations occurred.  While Applicant's predicament  may be deserving of sympathy, it does not
provide a basis for mitigating his numerous,  knowing and willful violations of security regulations.
Subparagraphs 1.a (1), 1.a. (2), and 1.a. (3) and Criterion K are concluded against Applicant.</P>

<P>	Criterion E addresses conduct involving questionable judgment or unwillingness to comply
with rules and regulations.  By failing to comply with security regulations on numerous occasions
over a four year period, Applicant demonstrated both questionable judgment and an unwillingness
to comply with rules and regulations.  </P>

<P>	Favorable consideration has been given to Applicant's cooperation, honesty and truthfulness
during the DIS investigation.  He freely acknowledged in his signed, sworn statement that he had
knowingly violated security regulations by allowing uncleared employees access to classified
information and by preparing classified visit letters for them.  However the good judgment and
cooperation demonstrated by Applicant during the DIS investigation is insufficient to mitigate the
pattern of security violations which he committed and allowed to occur as the FSO of Company X.
Subparagraph 2.a. and Criterion E are concluded against Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are
hereby rendered as follows:</P>

<P>	Paragraph 1 (Criterion K)				AGAINST THE APPLICANT</P>

<P>		Subparagraph 1.a.				Against the Applicant</P>

<P>		Subparagraph 1.a. (1).			Against the Applicant</P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER>DECISION</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.</P>
