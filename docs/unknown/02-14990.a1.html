<P>Administrative Judge Elizabeth M. Matchinski issued a decision, dated December 6, 2002, in which she concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application; 
and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the 
Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated May 31, 2002.  The SOR was based on Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).  A hearing was held on September 12, 2002.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated December 6, 2002.  In the decision, the Judge entered formal findings in favor of Applicant with 
respect to Guideline G, but against him with respect to one SOR subparagraph under Guideline E.  The Judge concluded, based on her adverse conclusions 
under Guideline E, that is it not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Administrative Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant 
falsified a security clearance application in July 2000 by failing to disclose an alcohol-related incident that resulted in his being arrested in April 1996 (SOR 
subparagraph 1.a).  On appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge's finding of falsification, contending that his omission of the April 1996 arrest from the security 
clearance application was not due to any intent by him to conceal it from the government.</P> 
 
<P>During the proceedings below, Applicant denied that he had any intent to deceive or mislead the government when he omitted the April 1996 arrest from the 
security clearance application.  Applicant's statements about his intent or state of mind when he completed the security clearance application are relevant 
evidence that the Administrative Judge had to consider.  However, Applicant's statements were not binding on the Judge.  Rather, the Judge had to consider 
Applicant's statements in light of her assessment of his credibility and the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0194 (February 29, 2000) at 
p. 3.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge's finding of falsification reflects a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  
Applicant's arguments fail to demonstrate the Judge's finding is erroneous.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  In addition to challenging the Administrative Judge's 
finding of falsification, Applicant also argues: (a) his personal and professional histories demonstrate he has good judgment, and is reliable and trustworthy; (b) 
the testimony of his supervisor shows he is trustworthy and reliable; and (c) the DSS investigation of him resulted in people recommending him for a position 
of trust.  The Board construes these arguments as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal arguments rely, in part, on factual assertions that go beyond the record evidence below.<A HREF="02-14990.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Such factual assertions constitute new evidence, 
which the Board cannot consider.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  The Board will consider Applicant's appeal arguments only to the 
extent that they rely on record evidence.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant presented evidence about his personal and professional histories for the Administrative Judge's consideration.  Applicant's supervisor also testified 
on his behalf.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge considers all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  S<EM>ee, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  Apart from that rebuttable presumption, a reading of the Administrative Judge's decision persuades the Board that the 
Judge considered the evidence presented on Applicant's behalf that he cites on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant on appeal does not demonstrate the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law.  The mere presence of favorable record evidence does compel a Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  The Judge had to consider the 
record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, and make findings of fact and reach conclusions about the security significance of Applicant's 
conduct and circumstances.  In weighing the record evidence, the Judge had to consider whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence, 
or <EM>vice versa</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application is sustainable.  Based on that 
finding of falsification, it was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to draw negative inferences about Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  
Furthermore, the Judge's finding of falsification provides a rational basis for a Judge to draw adverse conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility and 
conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to demonstrate error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision.</P>
