<P>Applicant has surrendered his passport and indicated a willingness to revoke his citizenship.  His family connections are not of a type that would make him 
vulnerable to coercion or pressure.  His financial interest overseas is very slight.  Adverse inference is overcome.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 7, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 28, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on March 11, 2002, 
and a Notice of Hearing was issued on March 21, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on April 19, 2002, at which the Government presented three  documentary exhibits, and called one witness.  Testimony was taken from the 
Applicant, who called one additional witness, and also submitted one hearing exhibit and two post-hearing exhibits.  Applicant's Exhibit B is a letter from the 
British Consulate-General, Los Angeles dated April 29, 2002; Applicant's Exhibit C consists of three notarized statements from family members.  The 
transcript was received on April 29, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 56 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Computer Operations Lead, and he seeks to obtain a DoD security clearance in 
connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the 
live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign preference)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in 
such a way as to show a preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was born in the United Kingdom in 1946.  He moved to the United States in 1987.  The Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in 
September 1996.  (Government Exhibit 1 at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Security Clearance Application dated January 12, 1999 (Government Exhibit 1), the Applicant stated "Yes" to question 15 where it asks "In the last seven 
years, have you had an active passport that was issued by a foreign government?"  The Applicant had renewed his British passport for ten years in August 1996, 
a month before he became a naturalized American citizen.  The Applicant possessed this British passport at the time of the issuance of the SOR.  The Applicant 
has never traveled on this British  passport.  (Transcript at 26.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant stated at the hearing that he would be willing to surrender his British passport and procedures were discussed concerning how he could do that.  
(Transcript at 28, 46-47 and 60-61.)  Applicant's Exhibit B is a letter from the British Vice-Consul in Los Angeles stating that the Applicant surrendered his 
British passport to her on April 29, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that he does not believe himself to be a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and the United States.  He has no hesitation in letting the 
British Embassy know that he no longer views himself as a British citizen.  (Transcript at 24-25 and 59-60.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign influence)</SPAN>.   The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has 
immediate family members or people to whom he may be bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be subject to 
duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's wife is a naturalized American citizen, like the Applicant.  The Applicant's mother and his two sons are British citizens.  However, all three of 
them are permanent residents of the United States.  The three of them filed notarized statements stating that they are currently living in the United States and 
have no intention of returning to the United Kingdom.  (Applicant's Exhibit C.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the age of retirement, the Applicant may be eligible for a small pension similar to our Social Security.  The Applicant has no other monetary interests 
overseas.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B (Foreign influence)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(5) Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to effect the individual's security  responsibilities. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline C (Foreign preference)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Additional policy guidance regarding the possession of a foreign passport is also found in the August 16, 2000, Memorandum from the Assistant Secretary of 
Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence entitled "Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the Application 
of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline."  (Money Memorandum.)  In pertinent part the Memorandum states, "[C]onsistent application of the 
[Foreign Preference] guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval 
for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be a dual citizen or have foreign connections that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has foreign connections, that he was a dual citizen 
of the United Kingdom and the United States, and that he possessed a British passport after he became an American citizen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation and mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome the Government's 
case against him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows that the Applicant is willing to revoke his British citizenship, even though he believes himself only to be an American citizen.  In addition, 
his British passport has been returned to the British Consulate, and is in their possession. Accordingly, he has more than fulfilled the requirements of the Money 
emorandum.  In addition, other than his possession of a passport, there is no evidence that the Applicant ever exercised dual citizenship with the United 
Kingdom after he became an American citizen.  Guideline C is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning to Guideline B, one finds that all the members of the Applicant's immediate family live in the United States.  His mother and two sons state in writing 
that they have no intention of returning to England.  His wife, like the Applicant, is already a naturalized American citizen.  His British government pension is 
small, and is something he may collect sometime in the future.  A common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of the Applicant's family ties 
persuasively shows that the Applicant is not in a position to be vulnerable to foreign influence. Guideline B is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.b.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 2.a.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 2.b.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 2.c.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
