<P>Administrative Judge Kathryn M. Braeman issued a decision, dated December 31, 1998, in which she concluded it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed. 
For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge failed to properly apply pertinent
provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or
contrary to law.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated June 30, 1998 to Applicant.  The
SOR was based on Criterion J (Criminal Conduct) and Criterion D (Sexual Behavior).</P>

<P>A hearing was held on November 17, 1998.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a written decision.  The Judge
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The
case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Administrative Judge's Findings and Conclusions</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant sexually abused his minor daughters over a period of 10-12 years, ending when he was arrested in December
1995.  In 1996 Applicant pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual assault and was placed on probation, ordered removed
from the family home, and prohibited from having any contact with his own or any other minor children.  Applicant began
treatment in December 1995, with a psychologist who is a certified sex offender provider and evaluator.  Apart from an
August 1996 incident that was a violation of probation, Applicant has had exemplary attendance and participation in his
probation obligations.  Applicant's probation officer is not willing to state whether or not Applicant would satisfy his
treatment objectives by February 2000.  Applicant's treating psychologist believes Applicant has made significant
progress in his treatment, but estimates that Applicant's probation will be extended 12 to 18 months beyond February
2000. </P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></P>

<P>1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge failed to properly apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines</U>. 
Applicant makes three arguments in support of his contention that the Administrative Judge failed to properly apply
pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines: (a) the Judge erred by concluding Applicant did not satisfy any of the
Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions; (b) the Judge erred by concluding Applicant did not satisfy any of the Criminal
Conduct Mitigating Conditions; and (c) the Judge erred by failing to consider some of the general factors set forth in the
"Adjudicative Process" section of the Adjudicative Guidelines.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes
Applicant has failed to demonstrate harmful error by the Judge.</P>

<P>(a) The Administrative Judge concluded that none of the Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions applied to Applicant's
case.  Applicant contends the Judge erred because the record evidence supports application of Sexual Behavior Mitigating
Conditions 2, 3, and 4.  This contention has mixed merit.</P>

<P><U>Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2</U>.<A HREF="98-0394.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2 does not give any definition of, or
guidance about, the meaning of the word "recent."  However, the absence of such a definition or guidance does not end
the analysis.  Because the Directive requires a common sense decision (Section F.3.), an Administrative Judge must apply
undefined terms such as "recent" in a reasonable, common sense way.</P>

<P>There is no dispute that Applicant's sexual abuse of his three minor daughters occurred over a period of approximately 10-12 years and ended approximately three years before the hearing, and there is no evidence of subsequent misconduct of a
similar nature.  It is not frivolous for Applicant to argue that the passage of three years militates in favor of application of
Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2.  Although the Judge's decision sets forth an analysis of Applicant's sexual
misconduct, it fails to articulate a rational basis for why she decided not to apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2. 
At most, the Judge's decision contains a discussion which provides a rational basis for giving little weight to Sexual
Behavior Mitigating Condition 2.</P>

<P>The Board is not holding that the passage of three years without a recurrence, standing alone, mandates application of
Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2.  However, the passage of three years without recurrence of sexual misconduct by
an applicant calls for the Administrative Judge to give an explanation why the Judge concludes it is not appropriate to
apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2.</P>

<P><U>Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 3</U>.<A HREF="98-0394.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  The Administrative Judge did not articulate a rational basis for why she
decided not to apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 3.  As with Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2, the
Judge's decision contains a discussion which, at most, provides a rational basis for giving little weight to Sexual Behavior
itigating Condition 3.  The Judge's discussion provides an insufficient basis for the Judge to conclude Sexual Behavior
itigating Condition 3 did not apply in this case.  However, given the record as a whole, there is not a significant chance
that application of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 3 would have led to a different result by the Judge.</P>

<P><U>Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 4</U>.<A HREF="98-0394.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  Applicant's argument concerning Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 4 is
not persuasive.  Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 4 would be applicable if a Judge concluded: (a) an applicant's
sexual misconduct caused the applicant to be vulnerable to undue influence or coercion (Sexual Behavior Disqualifying
Condition 3), and (b) the applicant's current situation no longer left the applicant vulnerable to undue influence or
coercion because of the past sexual misconduct.  In this case, the Administrative Judge did not conclude that Applicant's
sexual misconduct caused him to be vulnerable to undue influence or coercion.  Absent such a conclusion, it was
reasonable for the Judge to not apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 4 in this case.  <EM>Cf.</EM> ISCR Case No. 97-0289
(January 22, 1998) at p. 4 (absent a finding by Administrative Judge that applicant's falsification increased his
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, it was not error for Judge to not apply Personal Conduct mitigating
condition pertaining to reduction or elimination of vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or pressure).</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's errors with respect to Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions 2 and 3 are not harmful.  The
mere presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not solely dispositive of a case.  Even when a
disqualifying or mitigating condition is applicable, the Judge cannot be expected to consider it in isolation and without
regard to the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0825 (January 7, 1999) at p. 3.  Considering the
record as a whole, the Board is not persuaded that application of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions 2 and 3 would
have affected the Judge's overall analysis sufficiently to lead the Judge to reach a different result.  Accordingly, the Board
concludes these errors are harmless.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0265 (March 17, 1999) at p. 5 (discussing harmless
error doctrine); ISCR Case No. 97-0825 (January 7, 1999) at p. 3 (explaining why Administrative Judge's failure to apply
Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition 3 was harmless error).</P>

<P>(b) The Administrative Judge concluded Applicant did not satisfy any of the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions. 
Applicant contends the Judge erred because the record evidence supports application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating
Conditions 1 and 5.  For the reasons that follow, this contention has mixed merit.</P>

<P><U>Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1</U>.<A HREF="98-0394.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 does not give any definition of, or
guidance about, the meaning of the word "recent."  As discussed earlier in this decision, an Administrative Judge must
apply undefined terms such as "recent" in a reasonable, common sense way.</P>

<P>As noted earlier, there is no dispute that Applicant's sexual abuse of his three minor daughters occurred over a period of
approximately 10-12 years and ended approximately three years before the hearing, and there is no evidence of
subsequent misconduct of a similar nature.  Again, it is not frivolous for Applicant to argue that the passage of three years
militates in favor of application of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.  Although the Judge's decision sets forth an
analysis of Applicant's criminal sexual misconduct, it fails to articulate a rational basis for why she decided not to apply
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.  At most, the Judge's decision contains a discussion which provides a rational
basis for giving little weight to Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.</P>

<P>The Board is not holding that the passage of three years without a recurrence, standing alone, mandates application of
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.  However, the passage of three years without recurrence of criminal conduct by
an applicant calls for the Administrative Judge to give an explanation why the Judge concludes it is not appropriate to
apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's error with respect to Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 is not harmful.  As discussed
earlier in this decision, the mere presence or absence of an Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying or mitigating condition
is not solely dispositive of a case.  Considering the record as a whole, the Board is not persuaded that application of
Criminal Conduct Mitigating 1 would have affected the Judge's overall analysis sufficiently to result in a different result. 
Accordingly, the Board concludes this error is harmless.</P>

<P><U>Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5</U>.<A HREF="98-0394.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>  Applicant's argument concerning Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5
lacks merit.  The Administrative Judge gave an explanation for her conclusion that Applicant's rehabilitation efforts did
not merit application of this mitigating condition.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's overall
explanation reflects a reasonable, plausible interpretation of the evidence.  Applicant's ability to argue for an alternate
interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's weighing of the evidence concerning
Applicant's rehabilitation efforts was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  </P>

<P>Applicant's brief does identify some minor flaws with the Administrative Judge's discussion of Applicant's rehabilitation
efforts.  However, the Board does not measure a Judge's decision against a standard of perfection. <EM> See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case
No. 97-0765 (December 1, 1998) at p. 6.  In this case, Applicant's ability to identify some minor flaws with the Judge's
discussion does not demonstrate errors that warrant remand or reversal.</P>

<P>(c) Applicant contends the Administrative Judge failed to consider and apply some of the general factors set forth in the
"Adjudicative Process" section of the Adjudicative Guidelines (Directive, Enclosure 2 at page 2-3).  Specifically,
Applicant contends the Judge failed to take into account the following factors: (i) Applicant voluntarily reported his
misconduct to the government; (ii) Applicant sought assistance and followed professional guidance; and (iii) Applicant
has demonstrated positive changes in behavior.  Applicant's contention lacks merit.</P>

<P>A reading of the decision below shows the Administrative Judge: noted that Applicant volunteered information about his
sexual misconduct to the Defense Security Service; discussed Applicant's participation in therapy and a counseling
program; and found Applicant had demonstrated positive changes in his behavior.  The Judge also gave rational
explanations for why she concluded these, and other favorable evidence, were not sufficient to meet Applicant's burden of
demonstrating extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance
decision (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 15).  The fact that the Judge did not find the favorable evidence
cited by Applicant to be of sufficient weight to warrant a favorable security clearance decision does not mean the Judge
failed to consider it.</P>

<P>2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</U>.  Applicant makes four
arguments that raise the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law:
(a) the Judge erred by evaluating Applicant's case under a Criterion not alleged in the SOR; (b) the Judge failed to
properly apply pertinent provisions of the Adjudicative Guidelines; (c) the Judge failed to properly weigh the favorable
record evidence; and (d) there is no evidence that Applicant ever committed a security violation.</P>

<P>(a) Applicant argues the Administrative Judge erred by discussing Criterion I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality
Disorders) because that Criterion was not alleged in the SOR.  This argument lacks merit.</P>

<P>In general, an adverse security clearance decision cannot be based on matters not alleged in the SOR.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR
Case No. 97-0356 (April 21, 1998) at p. 3.  However, this case does not involve an adverse decision based on matters not
alleged in the SOR issued to Applicant.  The SOR alleged that Applicant's sexual misconduct with his minor daughters
fell under Criterion  D (Sexual Behavior) and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).  Under the Sexual Behavior portion of the
Adjudicative Guidelines section of the Directive (Enclosure 2 at page 2-10), the following footnote appears: "The
adjudicator should also consider guidelines pertaining to criminal conduct (criterion J), or emotional, mental, and
personality disorders (criterion I), in determining how to resolve the security concerns raised by sexual behavior."  That
language places an applicant on sufficient notice that allegations under Criterion D (Sexual Behavior) can be evaluated by
an adjudicator<A HREF="98-0394.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> under any applicable guidelines under Criterion J and Criterion I.  Accordingly, the Judge did not err in
this case by considering Applicant's case under the adjudicative guidelines for Criterion I.</P>

<P>The result on appeal would be the same even if the Board were to accept Applicant's request that it ignore the
Administrative Judge's analysis under Criterion I.  The Judge's adverse decision can be sustained solely by her analysis of
Applicant's conduct under Criterion J and Criterion D.</P>

<P>(b) The Board has already discussed Applicant's arguments concerning the Administrative Judge's application of the
Adjudicative Guidelines.  To the extent the Judge erred in her application of those Adjudicative Guidelines, the Judge
acted in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  However, for the reasons given earlier in this
decision, the Judge's errors are harmless in this case.</P>

<P>(c) Applicant argues the Administrative Judge failed to give due weight to the favorable evidence presented by Applicant,
and that the Judge's failure to do so warrants reversal by the Board.  For the reasons that follow, this argument is not
persuasive.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge has the primary responsibility for weighing the record evidence and making factual findings. 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 25.  The Judge's factual findings are subject to review on appeal. 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 32.a.  The Board will not disturb a Judge's weighing of the evidence
unless there is a showing that the Judge did so in a way that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR
Case No.  ISCR Case No. 98-0685 (May 20, 1999) at p. 3.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's responsibility as trier of fact is not diminished because the record in this case is mixed,
containing both favorable and unfavorable evidence.  The Judge had to consider the evidence as a whole and decide
whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0685
(May 20, 1999) at p. 3.  Accordingly, Applicant's ability to cite to favorable evidence in the record does not, by itself,
demonstrate the Judge acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner when she weighed the record evidence in this case. 
Furthermore, given the clearly consistent with the national interest standard (Executive Order 10865, Section 2; Directive,
Sections C.2. and D.2.), Applicant had a heavy burden of persuasion when seeking to demonstrate extenuation, mitigation
or changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a favorable security clearance decision.  Directive, Additional Procedural
Guidance, Item 15.</P>

<P>(d) Applicant's favorable security record weighs in his favor, but it is not dispositive.  The government need not wait until
an applicant fails to properly handle or safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke that applicant's
access to such information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). 
All that is necessary is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified
information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required
of persons given access to classified information.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0685 (May 20, 1999) at pp. 3-4. 
Applicant's long history of sexually abusing his minor daughters provides a rational basis for the Judge's negative
conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0605 (July 8, 1998) at p. 3 ("Acts of
criminal sexual misconduct raise questions about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness which the
applicant has the burden of overcoming."); ISCR Case No. 97-0618 (June 11, 1998) at p 3 ("Engaging in sexual
misconduct with minor females raises serious questions about a person's judgment and reliability and can provide a
rational basis for an adverse security clearance decision.").</P>

<P><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating error that warrants remand or reversal.  Accordingly, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's December 31, 1998 decision.</P>
