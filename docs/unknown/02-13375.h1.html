<P> While Applicant admits he failed to reveal a 1990 arrest for rape and a 1994 criminal charge of battery in completing an October 2001 security clearance 
application, his defense that he did not intend to falsify by these omissions is believable in light of his subsequent disclosures and the flaws in the government's 
claims and in the record.  The government provided no support for the 1990 rape charge where he maintained he was wrongfully arrested and the charges were 
ultimately dismissed.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) report lists a 1994 battery charge, but contains no record of conviction.  His criminal conduct 
can be mitigated as these 1990 and 1994 incident were dated and  isolated as there is no evidence that he has subsequently been implicated in any other criminal 
activity.  His work record demonstrates he is clearly rehabilitated.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on January 23, 2003.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-13375.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over criminal conduct (Guideline J) and personal conduct (Guideline E).  Applicant responded to 
these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on February 23, 2003; he requested a decision on a written record and did not request a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on March 21, 2003, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) for the Applicant's review and advised 
Applicant that he had 30 days to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge and that he had the right to 
be represented by counsel.  A Personnel Security Specialist (PSS) sent the FORM to Applicant on March 21, 2003, and again notified the Applicant that he had 
30 days from receipt of the letter to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge. Applicant received the 
FORM on April 8, 2003, with a response due on May 8, 2003. The Applicant submitted no response.  Subsequently, on May 23, 2003, the DOHA Director 
assigned<A HREF="02-13375.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> the case to me for a decision on the record. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 48 years old, has worked for Defense Contractor #1 in State #1 since September 2000.  Previously he worked in other positions for other employers.   
He served in the military from 1980 to 1986. He was married in 1996.  (Answer; Item 4)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant attended a college in State #2 from 1975 to 1979.  (Item 4)  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86), the EPSQ version in October 2001.  The SOR alleges a 1990 arrest for rape 
and a 1994 arrest and conviction for battery that he failed to disclose in response to two questions:</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>The SOR at 2.a. alleges he failed to list a 1990 arrest for "Rape, 1<SUP>st</SUP> Degree," on a security Clearance Application that he signed in May 2001<A HREF="02-13375.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> in response to 
"<STRONG>Question 21.  Your police Record - Felony Offenses</STRONG>: Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?  For this item, report 
information regardless of whether the record in your case has been 'sealed' or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement is 
for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 
18 U.S.C. 3607." </LI> 
 
 
<P>Applicant explained to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) security investigator why he failed to list this 1990 arrest and provided substantial 
mitigating information for not doing so.  In his supplement to his Answer to the SOR and in his February 2002 Statement to the OPM  investigator on the 
wrongful nature of the arrest, he provided a long explanation about this arrest for rape which he viewed as unjust and racially biased; he explained his being 
held in jail for several months since he could not post bond, and that the charge was finally dismissed.  Further, he explained he "didn't know that this was on 
file. . . ."  While Applicant admitted this arrest in response to SOR 1.a., he explained in mitigation that he was never told who instigated the arrest and even 
considered filing a suit for false arrest, but could not afford to do so.  The Government provided no evidence in the FORM of this 1990 arrest other that his 
voluntary Statement to the security investigator, so with no documentation on the 1990 arrest, I cannot conclude that the 1990 arrest in State #2 was a felony 
and that he had a duty to report it in answer to Question 21.  (Answer; Items 4, 5)  I conclude that Applicant did not omit it intentionally.</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>The SOR charges in 2.b. that he falsified material facts on a "Standard Form 85-P" signed in "October 31, 2000" when he answered "No" to Question "'<STRONG>20.  
Your Police Record</STRONG> - In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)?  (Leave out traffic fines of less that 
$150.'"  (Answer; Item 4)  </LI> 
 
 
<P>However, the SF 86 Applicant signed does not contain that wording for Question 20.  On the SF 86 form Applicant signed in October 2001 (not a SF 85-P<A HREF="02-13375.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
form as alleged), Question 20 involves adverse information in employment, not arrests.  (Item 4)  The FORM did include a partially supportive FBI report of a 
January 1994 charge of battery in State #3 which Applicant admitted in response to SOR 1.b., but the FORM contained no evidence of the disposition of the 
1994 charge. (Item 6)  In mitigation Applicant claimed that he pleaded guilty to the incident which occurred during a heated argument with his girlfriend.  
While he admitted in response to SOR 2.b. that he did not include information on the 1994 arrest in his security form, he provided substantial mitigating 
information for not doing so which supports a conclusion that he did not omit it intentionally.  I note that the Criterion E SOR 2.b. allegation cites the wrong 
form (Standard Form 85-P), cites the wrong date (October 2000), and cites the wrong questions (20).  </P> 
 
<P>In his Answer Applicant contests the validity of this alleged conviction as he was not represented by counsel at the time of the charge; although the FBI record 
lists the charge, it does not list the disposition of this case as alleged in SOR 1.a.  Further, while he cooperated fully with the security investigator in discussing 
the 1990 incident, that Affidavit statement does not include any information nor any reference to a 1994 incident even though in his Answer Applicant stated 
the investigator brought the incident to his attention.  I conclude from his statement in his Answer that he had no intent to falsify by not disclosing this incident 
on his October 2001 SF 86 security form.  Further the January 1994 arrest was not within the seven year time limit for past criminal conduct in the SF 86 
questions.  (Answer, Items 4, 5, 6)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant stated he has been working for his company for three years without missing a day, and he puts in many hours of overtime.  He states he is very good 
at his work and highly respected<A HREF="02-13375.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> by his co-workers.   He states he has worked in many agency buildings without any incident and is  a hard worker.  He 
mentions he has worked for two different U.S. Attorney Generals.  I conclude Applicant had no intent to falsify and cooperated fully with the security 
investigator.  (Answer; Item 5)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><STRONG>Guideline  J</STRONG> <STRONG>- Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant mitigated security concerns over his criminal conduct in 1990 and 1994 as these incidents were dated and factors leading to these violations are 
unlikely to recur.  The Government provided no evidence in the FORM on the 1990 arrest for rape other that his voluntary Statement to the security investigator 
where he persuasively asserted that the arrest was wrongful and ultimately dismissed.  Thus, I cannot conclude that the 1990 arrest in State #2 was, in fact, a 
felony.  While there was an FBI record of his 1994 arrest for battery, there was no evidence in the FORM of the disposition. Consequently, the Government has 
not established clearly this criminal conduct.  While he admitted these arrests, he provided persuasive evidence of mitigation.  </P> 
 
<P>The actions that led to these incidents may now be mitigated under condition (a) as the behavior was not recent, (d) . . . the factors leading to the violation are 
not likely to recur; and (f) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation as there is no evidence that he has subsequently been implicated in any other 
criminal activity since 1994.  Moreover, Applicant has a successful work record.   Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b. under SOR Paragraph 1. </P> 
 
<P> <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant mitigated security concerns over personal conduct issues in the October 2001 security clearance application form.  While he admitted he failed to 
disclose 1990 and 1994 arrests on his SF 86, neither are within the seven year window on questions relating to criminal conduct.  Further, both SOR 2.a. and 
2.b. are filled with errors as detailed in the Findings which create prejudice to Applicant as to the actual conduct alleged.  Indeed, because of the mistakes in 
both the reference to the form and to the question at issue, I cannot determine what question the Government thinks the Applicant falsified: the SOR at 2.b. 
cited the wrong form number and cited a question 20 that does not appear on his SF-86 form.  In the FORM, the Department Counsel based her arguments on a 
falsification of SF 86, instead of SF 85-P which was mistakenly alleged in SOR 2.b.  In this case I believe the Applicant was prejudiced by these mistakes and 
explained persuasively that he had no intent to falsify by omitting the 1994 incident from his security form.  Thus, I conclude the Government failed to establish 
their case of willful falsification of material facts.  </P> 
 
<P>Even if one were to conclude that the Government properly raised a security concern over personal conduct, Applicant has successfully  rebutted and overcame 
the Government's case as Applicant demonstrated that he has mitigated<A HREF="02-13375.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> this conduct.  Applicant nevertheless attempted to answer these questions by 
admitting his past arrests, but provided a lengthy Answer to establish that he  had no intent to falsify.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: 
C 2, the falsification was an isolated incident, and the individual subsequently provided correct information to the OPM investigator voluntarily.  Applicant 
cooperated with the security investigator and provided details that explain his reason for not including the 1990 arrest on his security form.  Based on all the 
facts, I conclude he had no intent to falsify by omitting these criminal matters from his SF 86.  Further, his current good work record provides evidence in 
mitigation.  Hence, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. under 
SOR Paragraph 2.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
