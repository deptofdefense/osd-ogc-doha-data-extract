<P>The Applicant submitted compelling evidence showing that he has successfully resolved three of his debts and has made a good faith attempt over several years

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 15, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on June 6, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on July 9, 2003, and a 
Notice of Hearing was issued on July 9, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on July 22, 2003, at which the Government presented four documentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also 
submitted 11 exhibits.  The transcript was received on July 30, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 29, separated and has a high school degree.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a system administrator, and he seeks to obtain a DoD 
security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and 
the live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F- Financial considerations)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is 
financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Subparagraph 1.a.</EM>  The Applicant admits that he incurred this credit card debt.  The Applicant settled with this creditor and has paid them off.  (Transcript at 
51.)  Applicant's Exhibit D at page 1 shows that the collection agency was deleting the account from the Applicant's credit reports.  The same exhibit at page 2 
also shows that the Applicant began contacting this creditor in December 2001 in an attempt to resolve this debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Subparagraph 1.b.</EM>  The Applicant admits that he had an account with this credit card company.  He separated from his wife in the Summer of 2001 and was 
concerned about her running up charges on his accounts.  (Transcript at 35-38.)  Beginning in November 2001, he was in contact with this creditor to find out 
the status of this account, see if his wife made any charges, and arrange for payment.  (Applicant's Exhibit E at 2.)  After several more letters, the creditor 
eventually responded by informing the Applicant that they were requesting the credit reporting agencies to delete the account from their files.  (Applicant's 
Exhibit E at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Subparagraph 1.c.</EM>  The Applicant admits that he had an account with this credit card company.  Once again, he was concerned about his wife running up 
charges on the account and, in September 2001, he contacted the creditor to find out the status of the account, see if his wife had made any charges, and arrange 
for payment.  (Applicant's Exhibit F at 1.)  The Applicant did not receive a response and wrote again in February 2003.  (Applicant's Exhibit F at 2.)  As of the 
date of the hearing he had received no response.  The Applicant's credit bureau report from June 2003 does not show any account number for this debt.  
(Applicant's Exhibit H at 7.)  This has caused problems for the Applicant in attempting to resolve this indebtedness since the debt may have been transferred 
and the Applicant cannot find out who now owns the debt.  (Transcript at 40.)  The Applicant has the funds to resolve this situation if he can find out who the 
creditor is.  (Transcript at 43.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Subparagraph 1.d.</EM>  The Applicant admitted owing this consumer debt.  He made a payment arrangement with this creditor and the debt has been paid in full.  
(Applicant's Exhibit G at 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that this financial situation was caused by his moving from his home state to another state for work in 1998.  At that time he and his 
wife were involved in a custody battle with her first husband, which cost a considerable amount of money.  In 2001, he and his wife separated and he left his job 
and moved back to his home state.  He is now gainfully employed and his credit report shows that he is able to pay his current indebtedness, pay off any 
remaining past due indebtedness, and pay child support to his soon to be ex-wife.  (Transcript at 42-44.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 2, 2001, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that he did not have any debts which were currently over 90 days 
delinquent.  (Government Exhibit 1 at question 39.)  In fact the Applicant had the four past due debts set forth under Paragraph 1, above, which were currently 
more than 90 days delinquent as of the date of this questionnaire.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On Government Exhibit 1 at question 38 the Applicant did state that the debt set forth under Subparagraph 1.b., above, had been 180 days delinquent within the 
past 7 years.  The Applicant has stated that he put all four of the debts on the work sheet he filled out concerning this questionnaire.  The Applicant's work 
location is geographically distant from his company's headquarters, and the work sheets were faxed to the headquarters.  Then, the Applicant was faxed just the 
signature pages, not the entire electronic Personnel Security Questionnaire, which had been prepared by another person.  He was not given an opportunity to 
review the completed document.  During this transfer, according to the Applicant, several errors occurred in the document that was submitted.  (Transcript at 
21-28.) In addition, there were signs on Government Exhibit 1 that another person transcribed the Applicant's hand-written work sheet, especially on question 
38 where the Applicant is referred to in the third person in a statement that he allegedly wrote.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant was interviewed on April 23, 2002, he freely admitted all four of the past due debts.  (Government Exhibit 2 at 4.)  He further stated, "I 
thought I had disclosed all of my bad debts and I cannot explain why all of my bad debts do not appear on my security questionnaire.  I did not willfully attempt 
to omit pertinent information from my security questionnaire."  (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted several letters of recommendation from co-workers and supervisors  (Applicant's Exhibit A).  These individuals all stated that they 
hold the Applicant in high regard, that  he "is both trustworthy and a man of integrity."  (Applicant's Exhibit A at 4.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant also submitted excerpts from the Department of Defense Adjudicator's Desk Reference concerning indebtedness (Applicant's Exhibit J).  He 
made a particular point of several statements, including, "Many persons face serious financial problems through no fault of their own, so debt alone is rarely a 
basis for adverse administrative action.  A person making a good faith effort to pay off a large debt caused by unexpected medical expenses or business 
reverses, for example, is unlikely to be a security concern."  (Applicant's Exhibit J at 2.)  He also drew the Administrative Judge's attention to this statement, 
"If a subject has formally disputed a debt (i.e., written the creditor, hired an attorney, initiated a court action) prior to adjudication proceedings, the adjudicator 
may elect to disregard this debt until the issue is resolved."  (Applicant's Exhibit J at 5.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F (Financial considerations)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may have a history of excess indebtedness or be involved in acts of falsification that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability 
on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant had a history of indebtedness involving four 
particular debts (Guideline F); and that there was an answer on his Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ) that was false. (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced compelling evidence overcoming the Government's case.  Turning first to the four debts alleged in the SOR.  
The Applicant submitted evidence that three of these debts have been resolved.  Two were paid by the Applicant and on the third the creditor elected to delete 
the debt from the Applicant's credit report.  He has not received a response from the fourth creditor despite his repeated attempts to contact them.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence shows that the Applicant had marital and employment problems in 2001 that  aggravated his debt situation.  However, he submitted letters 
showing that, even at that early date, he was taking concrete steps to resolve the situations.  It is clear that he has not avoided these debts, and it is also clear that 
his current financial situation is stable and that he is dedicated to maintaining a proper financial state. Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regards to the alleged falsification, the Applicant has also overcome the Government's evidence.  There is evidence that the electronic PSQ was filled out 
by another person at his employer's home office, located in another state.  The electronic PSQ does contain information about one delinquent debt, putting the 
Government on notice that such problems exist.  In addition, the Applicant was very open during his interview about his debt problems.  Any motivation the 
Applicant had to deceive is also vitiated by his attempts to resolve the debts.  Finally, the Applicant's testimonial evidence on this matter was credible, 
believable and consistent with the documentary evidence available.  I find that he did not falsify his questionnaire.  Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  
Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the 
Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>
