<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On March 18, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 23, 2006, after 
the hearing, Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive 
&para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.<A HREF="04-02030.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's findings are supported by substantial evidence; whether the Administrative 
Judge erred in concluding Applicant's falsification of her security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable 
clearance decision under Guidelines E is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse findings are not supported by substantial evidence.  The Board does not find this argument 
persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the 
record. Directive &para; E3.1.32.1. "This is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the 
evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm'n</EM>, 383 U.S. 
607, 620, (1966). In evaluating the Administrative Judge's finding, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge's credibility determinations. 
Directive &para; E3.1.32.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The findings which Applicant complains about are permissible characterizations of the record evidence on the part of the Administrative Judge.  The 
Administrative Judge's material findings with respect Applicant's conduct of security concern reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record 
evidence.  The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Board sustains the Judge's material findings of security 
concern because they are supported by substantial evidence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant argues that she did not deliberately falsify her security clearance application by failing to disclose adverse information of security concern in 
response to four different questions covering two different subject matters.  She contends that the omission of the information in question was inadvertent, 
unintentional or the result of a mistake.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Administrative Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant's explanation for why she failed to disclose the information in question.  The Judge was 
not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject Applicant's explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant's explanation in light of the record evidence as a 
whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant's omissions were deliberate and intentional.  Accordingly, we sustain the Judge's 
findings of deliberate, intentional falsification.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.32.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(3) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision under Guideline E is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law because the Judge 
failed to consider the record as a whole, mis-weighed the evidence, and misapplied the mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Board does not 
find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant 
asserts that the Judge failed to discuss or give sufficient weight to numerous facts that tend to minimize Applicant's culpability.  A Judge is not required to 
mention or discuss each piece of record evidence.  ISCR Case No. 04-08134 at 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).  There is rebuttable presumption that a Judge 
"considered all the record evidence, unless the Judge specifically states otherwise." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id.  </EM>An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, 
or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a 
manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A review of the decision indicates that the Administrative Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the 
disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge found in favor of the Applicant under Guideline F.  
However, the Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions or whole-person factors under Guideline E, and reasonably 
explained why the evidence Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the record that was 
before him, the Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
