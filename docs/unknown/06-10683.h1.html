<P>On November 1, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR), changing the reference from Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel 
Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended to DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended and modified.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not object to the amendment.  I granted Department Counsel's motion (Record of Hearing (R.) 13).   </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>At her hearing on November 1, 2006, I granted Applicant's request to hold the hearing open until December 1, 2006, so that she could submit additional evidence (R. 68-69).  I directed her to 
submit her documentary evidence through Department Counsel to me.  <EM>Id</EM>.  On December 21, 2006, I received an email from Mr. Blank stating he had not received any additional evidence from her

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>On August 27, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Standard Form (SF) 85P.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  On August 16, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to her, pursuant to the Directive and the Regulation.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
details reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that she is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, received at DOHA on September 5, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  On October 13, 2006, the case was 
assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 1, 2006.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on November 28, 2006, and I received it on December 4, 2006.   </P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the five debts and that she filed for bankruptcy twice, as listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Her admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 29 years old.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  For the last nine years, she has been employed by a United States government contractor and is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her employee 
evaluations reveal a hard-working, reliable, outstanding employee.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN>She has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She received her high school diploma in 1995.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  She was married on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">November 6, 
2002.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  She has two children (born in 1997 and 2003) and one stepchild (born in 1990).<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2002, Applicant's husband became unemployed, and he remained unemployed except for odd jobs for two years (R. 29-30).  The family income decreased from about $44,000 per year to 
about $20,000 per year (R. 34).  In January 2005, he obtained employment (R. 30).  However,  in the summer of 2005, he was diagnosed with cancer, and suffered an amputation, which resulted in a 
brief period of unemployment (R. 31, 38).  Applicant was sometimes unable to earn much money because her infant children required her care (R. 31).  Her husband has returned to work and 
expects to earn about $43,000 to $45,000 in 2006 (R. 38, 46).  She and her husband have not made any payments on the delinquent debts in SOR &para;&para;</SPAN> 1.a to 1.e for the last two years (R. 39, 43).</P> 
 
<P> The three debts in SOR &para;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para; 1.a ($919), 1.b ($6,078), and 1.c ($5,347) are credit card debts that were charged off in October 2004, October 2003, and May 2004, respectively (R. 34).  The debts in 
SOR &para;&para; 1.b ($6,078) and 1.c ($5,347), totaling $11,425 resulted from dental work (R. 34-35).  Applicant provided documentation showing her dental bills in 2006 alone cost the family $5,899 (R. 
50-51, 57, 61; Exhibit E). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The debt in SOR &para; 1.d ($7,412) resulted from purchase of a mobile home in 2001.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant and her husband lived in the mobile home for about nine months, and then moved to another 
residence.  The mobile home was rented for awhile, and then Applicant and her husband decided not to re-rent it when a tenant left.  The mobile home was subsequently repossessed by the creditor, 
who held a lien on the mobile home.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>The debt in SOR &para;<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 1.e ($6,754) resulted from purchase of a vehicle (R. 37).  The vehicle was repossessed and sold.  After a credit was applied for the proceeds from the sale of the truck at auction, a 
debt of $6,754 remained ( R. 37).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her husband filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 twice as alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.f and 1.g.  The first bankruptcy was dismissed on December 15, 2004, because she was medically 
unable to attend the hearing (R. 30).  The second bankruptcy was dismissed on December 28, 2004, because the funds were not properly processed by the trustee (R. 30-31, 44).  After the second 
bankruptcy was dismissed, their money was returned, and they placed the funds received in their savings account (R. 43-44).  They currently have about $15,000 in their savings account, but have 
chosen not to pay their creditors until they discuss the situation in detail with their attorney and decide whether or not to file again for bankruptcy (R. 39, 42, 44-47).     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) on August 1, 2005, to a security investigator.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> In 2005, her gross salary was $1,871 per month, and her net salary was $1,572 per month.  
Her husband's net salary was $3,157.  Their expenses totaled $2,132 per month. She listed monthly household expenses as follows: rent ($942<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>), groceries ($400), clothing ($50), utilities ($350), 
car expenses ($130), medical ($60), child support ($200), and miscellaneous ($0).  She did not list any debts.  After deducting all expenses she and her husband had a positive cash flow of $2,597 
per month.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The PFS lists savings of $10,000 and a car or boat valued at $2,000.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since 2005, Applicant and her husband have reduced their total debt load, and have made some lifestyle changes 
to improve their financial status (R. 45).  For example, since 2005 they have not accepted additional credit cards, and pay for purchases with cash (R. 48-49).  The credit card debts listed on the SOR 
were actually larger before 2005, and they have paid them down to the SOR levels (R. 61).  The earlier debt levels were presented in their bankruptcy filings ( R. 62).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and her husband went to financial counseling in 2004, prior to filing the bankruptcy (R. 42).  They have not consulted any debt consolidation companies and did not know whether their 
attorney contacted the creditors in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.e (R. 49).  They indicated they would contact their bankruptcy attorney and determine what can be done to resolve the debts (R. 68).  The record 
was held open until December 1, 2006 to permit Applicant time to provide information about debt consolidation, settlement or other resolution (R. 65-68), but no such evidence was provided 
(Exhibit 10).    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER>In the evaluation of an Applicant's trustworthiness suitability for a public trust position, an administrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory</CENTER> 
 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). </P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the trustworthiness or security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to 
sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate trustworthiness concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth 
and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its 
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the 
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Regulation, Appendix 8, clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her five failures to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable or 
unwilling to pay her debts.  The five SOR debts remained delinquent for several years, and  continued to be delinquent at the time of her hearing.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of 
these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the 
government.<SUP><A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> I conclude FC 
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple (five) delinquent SOR debts that were not paid, settled or otherwise resolved at the time of her hearing.   </P> 
 
<P>FC MCs 3 and 4 partially apply to all five SOR debts at issue because the debts became delinquent several years ago and were the result of her husband's unemployment and underemployment, as 
well as their medical and dental problems.  These changes in family circumstances are good examples of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3, causing financial problems that 
may be "largely beyond the person's control."  I conclude that Applicant's statement about how her debts became delinquent is credible and sufficient to provide some credit under FC MC 3 in 
regard to her debts.  Applicant, however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she is still unable or unwilling to pay all of her debts.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how she 
endeavored to pay or resolve her five delinquent SOR debts over the last two years.  However, she and her husband's filing for bankruptcy as alleged in SOR &para;&para; 1.f and 1.g does not show a lack of 
trustworthiness.  Based on the sincerity of her testimony, and the other record indicia of improved financial self-discipline, I have some confidence that she is on the right track now towards 
correction of her financial problems.  She also receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there is sufficient evidence that she  received financial counseling in 2004, however, she was unable to 
apply the financial counseling to resolve her five delinquent SOR debts.  Accordingly, I will apply some credit for FC MCs 3 and 4 under the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>.  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.<A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  She has not provided sufficient information about 
how she attempted to resolve or repay her debts from 2005 until November 1, 2006.   Even though the record was held open an extra month, she did not provide evidence showing how she was 
resolving the five delinquent SOR debts.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">"Whole Person" Analysis</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is currently 
29 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowing and resulted from 
voluntary choices to <SUP></SUP>purchase items or to obtain services.  However, her inability to repay her debts resulted from her husband's unemployment or underemployment and their medical and dental 
problems.  Applicant and her husband have $15,000 in savings and have decided not to use their money to pay their creditors or to otherwise resolve five currently delinquent SOR debts.  There is 
some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, receipt of financial counseling in 2004, reduction of overall debt and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the 
complete absence of new delinquent debt over the last two years. </SPAN> The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant is current on her recent debts, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and her very positive 
employment history supports a determination of trustworthiness. </SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Changes resulting from counseling and greater awareness of financial responsibilities will result in a continuously improving trend 
of improved financial circumstances.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In sum, the likelihood of new debt problems is low because more than two years have elapsed since any new debt has accrued. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> However Applicant's financial case shows unwillingness to resolve 
her delinquent debts.  Five SOR debts are not paid or resolved.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude she has </SPAN>not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Substantial evidence supports a continuing trustworthiness concern. I take this position based on the law, my "careful consideration of the whole person factors"<SUP><A HREF="06-10683.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and supporting evidence, as well 
as my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities.  </SPAN>For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for a public trust

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other 
good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.'  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing 
that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a 
legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. </SPAN></P>
