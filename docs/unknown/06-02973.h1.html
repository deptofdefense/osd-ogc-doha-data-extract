<P>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>has had a history of overdue debts that have not been resolved.  Additionally, Applicant's credibility is suspect since she knew or should have known that the information that she 
provided to the Government in a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (QPTP) on <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">August  16, 2004, regarding her indebtedness, was materially incorrect and incomplete. Mitigation has not been

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On </SPAN>May 16<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 2006</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is eligible for 
assignment to a sensitive position </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to make a determination on this issue.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated June 6, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (RSOR). She requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 12, 2006, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case.

opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due by August 23, 2006, but Applicant filed no response to the FORM. The case was 
assigned to this Administrative Judge on November 3, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel offered eight documentary items (Exhibits 1-8), which have been admitted without objection.

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains 12 allegations, 1.a.,

In her RSOR, Applicant has admitted every SOR allegation </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit 2)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The admitted allegations are incorporated herein

fact: </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because when she completed a signed, sworn QPTP on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">August</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  16, 2004,  she furnished untruthful information to

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">At the time she completed the QPTP, Applicant had been over 180 days delinquent on all of the debts listed above, as 1.a. through 1.h., which totaled more than $8,600. She should have answered 
"Yes" to this question and included all of these debts that were more than 180 days overdue.</SPAN></P>

President provided that eligibility for access to classified information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the 
United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness 
and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security." DoD 5200.2-R, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">&para; C6.1.1.1. Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors [General 
Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with 
the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. The 
Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that 
demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable and unfavorable, 
with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based 
on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination 
in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines F and E:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's long history of indebtedness, and there is no evidence that Applicant has resolved 
these overdue debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A6.1.2.1.), and DC (E2.A6.1.2.3.), a history of not 
meeting financial obligations, and an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. I find that no Mitigating Condition (MC) is applicable to this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Until Applicant makes a good-faith effort to resolve her debts, and she can establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve 
Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline E -Personal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant knew or should have known that she provided false material information to the Government in response to a question  on the 
QPTP that she signed on </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">August</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  16, 2004.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">She should have answered "Yes" to question #22.b. and included all of the debts listed in the SOR that had been more than 180 days overdue.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> because the information </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">that Applicant provided in her QPTP was known or should have been known by her to be 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">omissions and concealment of relevant and material </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">facts.  No MCs apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, Applicant failed to offer any independent evidence indicating that she has reformed and is now reliable and trustworthy. This precludes a finding that it is now clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant. </SPAN></P>
