<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On March 8, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 17, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge James 
A. Young denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred in admitting and considering Government Exhibit 4; whether the 
Administrative Judge erred in making material findings; whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline G is arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>(1) Government Exhibit 4 is a state court Judgment and Sentence finding that shows Applicant was found not guilty of the 2003 Driving While Intoxicated 
charge referenced in SOR paragraph 1.b.  Applicant argues that it was error for the Administrative Judge to admit that document into evidence and consider it 
in reaching his decision, over Applicant's objection, because the offense was the subject of a subsequent state court expunction order.<A HREF="03-21933.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The Board does not 
find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The federal government has a compelling interest in protecting classified information.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  It is well-settled that officers of the federal government are not bound by state law when carrying out their official duties unless there is a specific act of Congress that 
expressly indicates otherwise.  Accordingly, whatever effect that expunction of an applicant's criminal record might have under state law, such an effect is not 
binding on the federal government in investigating or adjudicating an applicant's security eligibility.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0423 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 8, 
2001).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(2) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred in finding that Applicant's 2003 and 2000 Driving While Intoxicated arrests were alcohol-related 
because Applicant was found not guilty of the 2003 incident and was found guilty of Obstruction of a Highway/Passageway with respect to the 2000 incident.  
The Board does not find this argument persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The ultimate state court dispositions of the 2000 and 2003 incidents did not preclude the Administrative Judge from finding that the incidents were alcohol-related.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-01181 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2004).  The Administrative Judge's material findings with respect Applicant's conduct of 
security concern reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.  Considering the record 
evidence as a whole, the Judge's findings that the 2000 and 2003 incidents were alcohol-related are sustainable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(3) Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision should be reversed because Applicant's four alcohol-related, criminal incidents do 
not demonstrate a pattern, and there is a nine year separation in time between the first incident and the other three.  The Board does not find this argument 
persuasive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An 
applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related criminal incidents in 1991, 2000, 2002 and 
2003, and that he continues to consume alcohol to the point of intoxication once or twice a year.<A HREF="03-21933.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Judge also considered the fact that the 2003 DWI arrest 
resulted in an acquittal and was expunged.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the 
disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for applying the relevant 
disqualifying conditions and for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions in this case.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant 
had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge's ultimate 
unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline G is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
