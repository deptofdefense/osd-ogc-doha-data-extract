<P>In 1998, Applicant was arrested for distribution of marijuana and possession of a firearm, a felony.  He pled guilty to and was convicted of possession of 
marijuana, a misdemeanor, and sentenced as a first offender.  After completing all parts of his sentence, the charge was dismissed.  Applicant admitted smoking 
marijuana from 1992 to 1999.  On his security clearance application, Applicant answered "no" to the questions concern felony arrests, drug use and convictions, 
and firearms offenses.  Applicant has mitigated the security concerns for his drug use, but has not mitigated the security concerns for the deliberate falsifications 
on his security clearance application.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On August 13, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 19, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline H 
(Drug Involvement), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 26, 2004.  He admitted two of the allegations under Guideline H with explanation, and denied one allegation 
under Guideline H, and all allegations under Guidelines J and E.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge, and the request was received by 
DOHA on August 30, 2004.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on May 6, 2005, and the case was assigned to me on May 12, 2005.  A 
notice of hearing was issued on May 25, 2005, and the hearing convened on June 23, 2005.  Five government exhibits and the testimony of the Applicant were 
received during the hearing.  The record was kept open for Applicant to submit additional information.  Applicant timely submitted additional documents on 
July 6, 2005, and Department Counsel had no objection to consideration of the additional documents.  DOHA received the transcript on July 5, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULING ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Department Counsel moved to amend allegation 1.a. in the SOR to remove the allegation for possession of a firearm and substitute an allegation of possession 
of marijuana with intent to distribute to accurately reflect the criminal court proceedings.  Department Counsel also moved for a similar amendment to 
allegation 2.a.  Applicant's counsel had no objection to the amendment of the SOR.  Allegations 1.a. and 2.a. were amended as requested.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant's counsel 
also moved to make typographical error changes on Applicant's August 26, 2004, answer to the SOR.  Department counsel had no objection.  In paragraph 3 of 
the Answer, 1.b. was amended to read 1.c.; in paragraph 7, 3.b. was amended to read 3.c.; and in paragraph 8, 3.c. was amended to read 3.d.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 33-year-old college graduate in mechanical design technology.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a designer reviewing and modifying 
construction plans.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In 1998, Applicant was arrested for possession of a firearm and possession of marijuana.  He was indicted for the felony offense of possession of marijuana 
with intent to distribute.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He pled guilty to and was found guilty of the misdemeanor offense of possession of marijuana and received a first offender sentence 
and placed on probation for two years, to perform community service, to pay a fine of $575.50, to attend a substance abuse program, and his driver's license 
was suspended.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Applicant completed all conditions of his first offender sentence and the charges were order dismissed.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant claims that a passenger in 
his car was in possession of the marijuana but he knew the passenger had the drugs.  Applicant admitted there was a firearm in the car but he had a permit for 
the weapon.  He pled guilty on the advise of his attorney to take advantage of the first offender program and not run the risk of a jail sentence.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>As part of his first offender sentence, Applicant attended and completed a substance abuse program in 1999.  Applicant was tested for drugs during the program 
and all tests were negative.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Applicant admitted he started using marijuana in 1992 while a college student, and used the drug approximately ten times a year 
until the fall of 1999.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant submitted a security clearance application in 2002.  He answered "NO" to question 21 asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of a 
felony.  Applicant answered "NO" to question 22 asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms offense.  Applicant answered "NO" to 
question 24 asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of an offense related to alcohol or drugs.  Applicant answered "NO" to question 27 asking if 
since the age of 16 or in the last seven years had he used a controlled substance, for example, marijuana.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Applicant stated he believed he did not need to list 
the firearm and distribution of marijuana felony arrests, and his conviction for possession of marijuana, since the charges were dismissed under the first 
offender program.  Applicant stated he asked a legal resource business he was using if he had to list the offenses on his application.  He was advised he did not 
have to list the offense since they were dismissed.  Applicant could not recall the name of the attorney, the name of the legal resource firm, or the exact question 
he asked.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant claimed he answered question 27 wrong because he did not read it carefully.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant 
meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each 
clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, 
and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</P> 
<P>The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about the 
person.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to 
include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  "[T]he Directive 
presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."<A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  "Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." <A HREF="04-03148.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline H - Drug Involvement: There is a security concern because the improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's 
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</P> 
<P>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct: There is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability 
and trustworthiness.</P> 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: There is a security concern because conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under both Guidelines H and J.  Applicant's admitted use of marijuana, and his plea and finding of guilty to possession 
of marijuana establishes Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions E2.A8.1.2.1 (<EM>any drug abuse</EM>); E2.A8.1.2.2 (<EM>illegal drug possession, . . . </EM>) and Criminal 
Conduct Disqualifying Conditions E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>), and 
E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</P> 
<P>I have considered Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions E2.A8.1.3.1 (<EM>the drug involvement was not recent</EM>), E2.A8.1.3.3 (<EM>a demonstrated intent not to abuse 
any drugs in the future), </EM>and Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>), and E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>there is clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation).  </EM>The last time Applicant used marijuana was in 1999, almost six years ago.  His criminal conduct and drug use is not 
recent.  Applicant is now older, mature, and a steady worker in a highly technical position.  He has stated his intent not to use drugs again and there is no 
evidence he has used drugs.  He completed all sentencing requirements and successfully completed his drug treatment and counseling.  Applicant has 
demonstrated successful rehabilitation from his possession and use of marijuana.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated security concerns for drug involvement 
and criminal conduct.</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Applicant's false answers to four questions on his security clearance application brings the matter 
under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness. . . </EM>).  When Applicant submitted his security clearance application in 2002, he knew of his felony arrest for a firearms violation and drug 
possession with intent to distribute, and his misdemeanor conviction for possession of marijuana.  He knew he used drugs.  His false answers to the four 
questions are a deliberate attempt to conceal the information from security investigators so as to present a clear record for his security and trustworthiness 
determination.  In ordinary circumstances, it may be reasonable for a person to conclude they did not have to list certain offenses since the offenses were 
processed and dismissed under a first offender program.  Applicant went much further.  He stated he checked with legal counsel to see if he needed to list the 
offense.  Only two years later, he could not recall the name of the lawyer or the firm or even the question he posed to them.  His lack of memory is not 
reasonable and is a further indicator that he deliberately decided to conceal the information.  Applicant's deliberate concealment of his use of drugs and felony 
and firearm arrest shows questionable judgment and indicates untrustworthiness, lack of candor, and is dishonest.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns for his deliberate false answers to relevant and material facts.</P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P> 
<P>Paragraph 1, Guideline H:   FOR APPLICANT</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:    For Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:    For Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.c.:    For Applicant</P> 
<P>Paragraph 2, Guideline J:   FOR APPLICANT</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 2.a.:    For Applicant</P> 
<P>Paragraph 3, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 3.a.:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 3.b:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 3.c.:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 3.d.:    Against Applicant</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In light of all of the circumstances in the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  Clearance is denied.</P>
