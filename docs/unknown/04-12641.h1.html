<P>Applicant has not satisfied two federal tax liens totaling more than $80,000 and a state tax lien for more than $7,500.  He disclosed one federal tax lien on his 
security clearance application (SF-86), but he intentionally omitted a second federal tax lien, a state tax lien, and ten county tax liens.  Security concerns based 
on financial considerations and falsification of his SF-86 are not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 10, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision 
to not grant a security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 
20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges delinquent debts for federal and state taxes.  Under Guideline E, it alleges falsification of the SF-86 by intentionally failing 
to disclose federal, state, and county tax liens.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on August 28, 2005, and elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing.  Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline F.  In response to the allegations under Guideline E, he admitted his answers 
on the SF-86 were incomplete, but he denied intentional falsification.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on November 22, 2005.  A 
complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to 
refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on December 1, 2005 and responded on December 29, 2005.  The 
case was assigned to me on January 23, 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, including Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and response to the FORM, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 49-year-old consultant for a defense contractor.  He is married and has one child.  He has held a security clearance since 1992.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not satisfied a tax lien filed against him in April 1998 for about $7,542 in state income taxes.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He also has not satisfied two federal tax liens 
totaling more than $80,000 filed against him in August 1999.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He has experienced brief periods of unemployment for up to 30 days, but he is currently 
employed.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  His personal financial statement executed on June 10, 2004 indicated he had a net monthly remainder of about $1,397.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Ten county tax liens were filed against his property between April 1998 and April 2002.  Eight were satisfied in September and October 2001, and two were 
satisfied in April 2004.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent taxes.  He admitted procrastinating, and he explained he took no action to resolve his tax situation 
because he often worked away from home and did not have the money to hire an accountant or a lawyer.  He stated he intended to obtain a home equity loan 
and pay the taxes.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  In his response to the FORM, he repeated his intention to use a home equity loan to resolve his tax delinquencies,<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> but he had not done so 
by the time this case was submitted for decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed one federal tax lien on his SF-86, but he did not disclose a second federal tax lien, the state tax lien, or ten county tax liens.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He did not 
disclose the county tax liens because he used his credit report to prepare the SF-86 and none of the county tax liens were reflected on the credit report.  He knew 
the liens had been filed, but he did not disclose them on his SF-86 because he was unsure of the details.  He believed his disclosure of the large federal tax lien 
would trigger further inquiry.<A HREF="04-12641.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an applicant 
has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness 
to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Applicant's failures to satisfy his federal, state, and county tax obligations establish DC 1 and DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent debts were not recent (MC 1) or were an isolated incident (MC 2).  
Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1., E2.A6.1.3.2.  Applicant has multiple delinquent debts that are not yet resolved.  I conclude MC 1 and MC 2 are not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control (MC 3).  Directive 
&para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Even if Applicant's financial difficulties initially arose due to circumstances outside his control, the Judge reasonably could consider whether 
Applicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties."  ISCR Case No. 02-02116 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2003).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although 
Applicant had periods of unemployment for up to 30 days, his personal financial statement reflects a net monthly remainder of almost $1.400.  He admits he has 
sufficient equity in his home to satisfy the tax liens.  He has expressed his intent to obtain a home equity loan and satisfy the tax liens but has not yet done so.  I 
conclude MC 3 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The 
concept of good faith "requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR 
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant settled his county tax debts.  He promised to resolve his federal and state tax 
debts with a home equity loan, but he had not done so by the time the case was submitted for decision.  MC 6 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the disqualifying conditions and the absence of mitigating conditions, and  evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concern based on financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under this guideline, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A disqualifying condition</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> (DC 2) 
applies where there has been a deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personal security questionnaire.  Directive 
&para;E2.A5.1.2.2.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant's state of mind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is 
direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 
17, 2004).  Applicant disclosed a federal tax lien for $73,808, but failed to disclose a second federal tax lien, a state tax lien, and ten county tax liens.  He 
admitted he was aware of the undisclosed liens.  His only excuse for nondisclosure was that he did not have the details of the undisclosed liens and believed his 
disclosure of the one large federal tax lien would trigger further inquiry.  I conclude DC 2 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two mitigating conditions (MC) are relevant to this case.  MC 2 applies when the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has 
subsequently provided correct information voluntarily.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  MC 3 applies when the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct 
the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3.  Neither condition is established.  Applicant's falsification was "recent," and 
he made no effort to correct the information.  He merely waited until security investigators uncovered the information, and then he admitted it.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the disqualifying condition established by the evidence and the absence of mitigating conditions, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concern based on his intentional omission of relevant and material information from his SF-86.</SPAN></P>
