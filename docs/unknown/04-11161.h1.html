<P>Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under foreign preference by demonstrating that she lost her Zimbabwean citizenship as a matter of Zimbabwean law when she became a naturalized U.S. 
citizen in November 2003, and she had surrendered her Zimbabwean passport to the Zimbabwean Embassy in February 2006. Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under foreign influence by 
demonstrating that her family members living in Zimbabwe were not agents of a foreign government or so situated as to provide a point of influence on Applicant. Clearance granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant challenges the 13 July 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of his clearance because of foreign preference, 
foreign influence, and personal conduct.<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 9 August 2005 initially requested a decision without hearing, but later requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 20 
December 2005 and I convened a hearing on 23 February 2006. DOHA received the transcript 7 March 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations under Guideline B. She denied being a dual citizen under Guideline C and denied intending to falsify her clearance application under Guideline E. I incorporate 
her admission as  findings of fact. She is a 38-year-old employee of a  defense contractor, who has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Zimbabwe in May 1967. She initially came to the U.S. in 1992 on a visitor visa, but changed it to student visa when she entered community college, and eventually became a legal 
permanent resident of the U.S. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2003. Six days later, she applied for her clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for her clearance (G.E. 1), she disclosed her foreign birth, potential dual citizenship, foreign passport, foreign relatives, and her foreign travel (an October 1999 trip back to 
Zimbabwe for her father's funeral).<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She did not disclose that she owned a house in Zimbabwe that she purchased for $20,000 at a time when she thought she might return to live in Zimbabwe. She 
testified credibly that she omitted the property because she misconstrued the question to mean business property, of which she had none. Her mother lived in the house until 2004, when it was torn down 
under a government program aimed at destroying what it considered to be "trash" houses in the countryside.<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant immigrated to the U.S. in 1992, she did so using a Zimbabwean passport. Under U.S. immigration law, she was required to maintain a current passport from her country of citizenship. 
When Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2003, she possessed a Zimbabwean passport valid until November 2009. She has credibly stated that she retained the passport only as a 
record that she was in the U.S. legally, and that she did not intend to renew it. In her July 2004 sworn statement (G.E. 2), she stated her willingness to renounce her Zimbabwean citizenship and 
surrender her passport. This was before she learned that she had lost her Zimbabwean citizenship as a matter of Zimbabwean law when she became a U.S. citizen and before she knew the consequences 
of retaining her foreign passport for any purpose. When she became aware of those consequences, she surrendered her Zimbabwean passport (A.E. C).<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother, some siblings, and step-siblings are citizens and residents of Zimbabwe. However, in the family structure of Zimbabwe she has virtually no contact with her step-siblings. Two of 
her step-brothers were policemen but one of them is dead.<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Her step-mother, who used to be a citizen and resident of Zimbabwe, is now dead.<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> One of her brothers is a retired, disabled veteran of the 
Zimbabwean army, who now works in a medical clinic for veterans.<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The only other family member who has any connection to the government is a brother who serves as a local magistrate.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character references--her company supervisor and the government agency program manager who monitors the contract--consider her a reliable and trustworthy person. She has an excellent 
work record and her employer recommends her for a clearance. She has adequately safeguarded company proprietary information. (AE A, B).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Zimbabwe is a developing nation with a poor human rights record. However, it is not known to be a collector of intelligence or economic information against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less than a 
preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each 
Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels 
resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government did not establish a Guideline C case. Applicant's dual citizenship was  based solely on her birth Zimbabwe. She has not exercised her Zimbabwean citizenship since becoming a U.S. 
citizen. In accordance with U.S. law, she maintained her Zimbabwean passport until she became a U.S. citizen, but surrendered it once she became aware of the consequences of retaining it for any 
purpose. She lost her Zimbabwean citizenship as a matter of law when she became a U.S. citizen. I resolve Guideline C for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B by demonstrating that Applicant's has family members who are citizens and residents of Zimbabwe. However, Applicant has 
met the relevant mitigating condition under foreign influence. None of her family members are agents are of a foreign government involved in any collection activity, and none of them are so situated as 
to provide a point of influence on Applicant, thus satisfying Mitigating Condition (MC) 1.<A HREF="04-11161.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In particular, Zimbabwe does not collect U.S. economic or intelligence information. I resolve Guideline B for 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government did not establish a Guideline E case, as Applicant lacked the requisite intent to mislead the government. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
