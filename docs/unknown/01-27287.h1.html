<P>Applicant filed a false W-4 withholding certificate with his current employer claiming he was legally married when he was single. He also listed on records for 
medical benefits filed with a former employer that he had an eligible dependent daughter, aware he was not the child's father. Of Nigerian ethnicity, Applicant 
has a sister and a brother who reside in Nigeria and his parents own a home there. In June 2002, he married a Nigerian citizen. Potential foreign influence 
concerns are mitigated by his parents' residency in the US since 1988, his father's acquisition of US citizenship in July 2002, his spouse's residency and 
employment in the US, and his siblings in Nigeria being neither agents of a foreign power or in positions of likely vulnerability to undue coercion, pressure, or 
influence. Personal conduct concerns persist because of his deliberate falsifications. Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On December 14, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 
11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.  DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to 
conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  The SOR was based on personal conduct (Guideline 
E) and foreign influence (Guideline B) concerns.</P> 
 
<P>With the aid of legal counsel, Applicant on January 2, 2003, responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. 
The case was assigned to me on March 17, 2003. By letter dated April 24, 2003, the attorney originally retained by Applicant withdrew his appearance. On May 
2, 2003, a formal notice was issued to Applicant scheduling the hearing for May 21, 2003. On May 14, 2003, newly retained legal counsel entered his 
appearance on behalf of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, which was held as scheduled, the Government's case consisted of seven exhibits and the testimony of the Defense Security Service (DSS) agent 
who interviewed Applicant in 2001. At the Government's request, official notice was taken of a U.S. Department of State country report on human rights 
practices in Nigeria for 2002, and a recent travel warning for Nigeria originally issued by the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs on August 8, 2002. 
Applicant presented three exhibits, which were entered without objections, and Applicant and his brother testified on Applicant's behalf. DOHA received the 
transcript of the hearing on June 3, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The SOR was issued under personal conduct concerns related to claiming falsely: 1) on a W-4 income tax withholding allowance certificate of April 30, 2001, 
that he was married at that time; 2) on forms for medical coverage submitted to a former employer that he had a daughter; 3) during DSS interviews in July and 
October 2001 that the mother of his son and his son lived at an address in the US other than their real address; and 4) on an April 1997 apartment rental 
application that his brother rather than he was to reside in the apartment--a brother whom he failed to list on his security clearance application (SF 86). Also 
alleged in the SOR were foreign influence concerns because of: 1) the Nigerian residency of his son and close associates/family members who care for him, 
with financial support from Applicant of $200 quarterly; 2) the Nigerian citizenship of his parents and their ownership of a residence in Lagos; and 3) foreign 
travel by Applicant to Nigeria in 1995 and December 2000, and his stay when there in a house owned by his parents. Applicant denied the personal conduct 
allegations, excepting his failure to list his brother on his SF 86 which he attributed to neglect. Of the foreign influence concerns, he admitted his parents' 
ownership of a home in Lagos, and his stay there on his foreign travel to Nigeria in 1995 and 2000. He denied the remaining Guideline B allegations. 
Applicant's admissions are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After review and consideration of the evidence of record, I make the following 
additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old engineer, employed by a defense contractor (company A) since April 2001. Applicant previously worked for the defense firm from 
about June 1990 to June 1995 as a welder, and held a clearance during that time. He seeks a secret clearance for his present duties.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in the US with his twin brother in February 1972 to citizens of Nigeria. In 1977, Applicant's parents had a daughter. After Applicant's 
father acquired his M.B.A. degree from a university in the US, Applicant's father moved the family to Nigeria in 1979, where his father worked for a 
government-owned oil company.  Two additional children were born to Applicant's parents in Nigeria, a daughter in about 1980 and a son in 1984. In 1988, 
Applicant and his parents returned to the US where they have since resided.</P> 
 
<P>In April 1990, Applicant entered a welder apprenticeship program at company A. He completed the program, and from April 1992 to June 1995 worked as a 
first class shipfitter until he was laid off. Over the next two years, Applicant pursued his associate's degree at a local community college taking short-term 
temporary work when available. In March 1994, a son was born to Applicant and a woman (Ms. B) with whom he was romantically involved.</P> 
 
<P>Circa July 1995, Applicant was charged with simple assault (domestic) following a disagreement with Ms. B that got out of hand. Applicant was placed on one 
year probation with counseling and ordered to have no contact with the mother of his son. Applicant's contact with his son thereafter was through his church as 
an intermediary.</P> 
 
<P>In January 1995, Applicant traveled to Nigeria on a US passport to see his younger brother and sister. He stayed in a residence owned by his parents in Lagos.</P> 
 
<P>After some time residing with his twin brother who was employed at a local hospital as an operating room technician, Applicant by April 1997 wanted his own 
place. Concerned he would not be able to rent an apartment as an unemployed student, Applicant asked his brother whether he could lease an apartment using 
his brother's name and employment. With the agreement of his brother, Applicant completed a rental application in his own hand in April 1997 under his 
brother's name, social security number, address, and employment, although he gave the rental agent a check for the deposit and rent in his own name. Applicant 
did not inform the lessor that he was not the person identified on the rental application.  Applicant's brother never had any intention to reside in the unit and he 
did not move in with Applicant.<A HREF="01-27287.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>In December 1997, Applicant went to work as a laboratory technician for a local chemical company. On documentation presented to this employer, Applicant 
listed as a dependent eligible for medical benefits a girl born to a woman (Ms. C) with whom he had a sexual relationship during the early 1990s, even though 
he was sure he was not the girl's father since his relationship with Ms. C had terminated more than a year before the girl's birth.<A HREF="01-27287.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Not required to document 
paternity, Applicant listed the girl as a dependent to appease Ms. C, who had lost her job and medical coverage. While Applicant now claims he believed then 
he was the girl's father based on the mother's assertions of his paternity (Tr. pp. 87, 135), he told a DSS agent in November 2001 that he disputed  he was her 
father. Consistent with his denial of paternity, he never listed the girl as a dependent on any income tax returns. In May 2000, Applicant left the employ of the 
chemical company to pursue his bachelor of science degree full-time at the state university.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant traveled to Nigeria in late December 2000, again to see his siblings. He stayed at the family's home in Lagos.</P> 
 
<P>While still a student at the university, Applicant applied to return to work at company A. In conjunction with his application for reemployment, Applicant 
executed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP) on March 15, 2001. On his application, Applicant noted his current marital status as "never 
married." Concerning relatives and associates, Applicant listed the Nigerian citizenship and US residency of his parents, and the US citizenship and residency 
of the sister born in 1977 and his son born in 1994. Applicant did not list those siblings living in Nigeria, his twin brother in the US, or his girlfriend (Ms. 
D)--a Nigerian citizen with whom he was cohabiting--even though question 14 requires the disclosure of all siblings, all foreign nationals, and adult 
cohabitants. An electronic version of the security clearance application (SF 86) was prepared on April 3, 2001, and submitted to the Department of Defense 
containing the information disclosed by Applicant on the March 15, 2001, QNSP.</P> 
 
<P>On April 30, 2001, Applicant executed an Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate (W-4). Under penalties of perjury, he checked off the block for 
married and claimed two allowances. He and Ms. D were cohabiting, but not legally married. Applicant denies any intent to defraud, maintaining he and his 
future wife were in a common law marriage and he was supporting her.  Asked to explain the discrepancy between his claim of single status on his SF 86 
completed only weeks before and his W-4, Applicant responded he left his then girlfriend off the SF 86 because the federal government might not recognize 
common law marriage. (<EM>See</EM> Tr. p. 145). The W-4 form is also a federal (IRS) form. Applicant's claim of an additional allowance based on marriage is found to 
have been knowingly fraudulent.</P> 
 
<P>From April 2001 to September 2002, Applicant's son lived in Nigeria with his maternal great-grandmother. Applicant's mother paid for the plane ticket to 
Nigeria for her grandson. While Applicant's son was staying in Nigeria in 2002, Applicant sent financial support for his son in the amount of $200.00 quarterly 
through his church. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was interviewed twice in July 2001 by a DSS special agent. During his initial interview, Applicant was asked about the rental application he had 
completed for an apartment in April 1997. Applicant initially told the agent the application was for an apartment that his twin brother had lived in. He then 
admitted he had used his brother's information to lease the apartment for himself, as he was not sure he would qualify as a renter given his status as an 
unemployed student at the time. Applicant provided a sworn statement in which he denied any intent to falsify his application for the rental unit, indicating that 
his twin brother "once in awhile" stays at the apartment for a few days. Applicant and the agent discussed his son, whom Applicant indicated he supported 
financially. Applicant denied that he had any other children. Asked about the address of Ms. B, the mother of his son, Applicant provided an address that the 
DSS agent subsequently determined did not exist. He had no direct contact with her so Applicant relied on information provided by others that proved to be 
incorrect. A week after the first interview, the agent and Applicant met to discuss foreign connections and foreign travel. At that time, Applicant presented his 
US passport to the agent, which reflected trips to Nigeria in 1995, which Applicant indicated was to visit his twin brother who was there on vacation, and in 
2000. Applicant told the agent he showed his son around his ethnic homeland during the recent visit.<A HREF="01-27287.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Sometime after his July 2001 interviews of Applicant, the DSS agent, through Applicant's employer, obtained from Applicant another address for Ms. B. The 
DSS agent was unable to find anyone at the address (an apartment complex) who knew of her. On November 27, 2001, the DSS agent met with Applicant to 
discuss the whereabouts of Ms. B and his son. Applicant was unable to identify the apartment of Ms. B from a diagram prepared by the agent. Applicant 
informed the agent that his son was in Nigeria, but he was unable to provide an address. Applicant indicated it had been a long time since he provided any 
support for his son. In response to the agent's inquiry, Applicant again denied he had any children other than his son. In possession of the record from 
Applicant's former employer where he claimed the daughter of Ms. C as a dependent, the agent asked Applicant why he had listed the girl as a dependent. 
Visibly shaken at the agent's inquiry, Applicant denied he was the girl's father but indicated she was his Goddaughter. He admitted he had been in a 
relationship with Ms. C, and explained she had been involved in heated discussions with him. To appease her, he listed the girl as a dependent, but had never 
filed any medical claims for benefits for her. At Applicant's request that the investigation be discontinued, the interview was terminated prematurely after the 
agent explained the possible ramifications of his failure to cooperate.</P> 
 
<P>On June 11, 2002, Applicant was reinterviewed by the DSS agent, this time about his foreign connections. During that interview, Applicant provided an address 
for his son in Nigeria--which he maintains he obtained from his sister who lives in Nigeria--and indicated he was supporting his son at the rate of $200.00 
quarterly. He identified by name and address those foreign relations residing outside the US (sister, brother, son's guardian) and within the US (his parents). 
Applicant did not include in that listing Ms. D, who he married on June 8, 2002, even though his spouse is a Nigerian citizen. He again denied paternity of Ms. 
C's daughter, and explained he listed the girl on medical forms at his previous employer because Ms. C asked him to. He indicated his belief he was not making 
a false claim as he had a family plan which included him, his son, and Ms. C's daughter. Applicant related he had claimed only his son as a dependent on 
income tax returns. Applicant attributed his termination of his November 2001 interview to rumors at his place of employment regarding his loyalty and 
citizenship and to his belief that the confidentiality of the investigation had been compromised.</P> 
 
<P>Since September 2002, Applicant's son has resided with the boy's mother (Ms. B) in the US. Applicant sends messages as well as clothes to his son through the 
church.</P> 
 
<P>On or about March 22, 2003, Applicant and his spouse completed joint federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2001 even though they were not legally 
married during tax year 2001. Applicant submits he is entitled to file a joint return for that year as he was married when he filed the return in 2003. He provided 
no reason for his failure to timely file the 2001 returns.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant traveled to Nigeria in March 2003 to see his younger siblings. His sister currently attends medical school in Nigeria; his brother attends college. They 
reside in the family home in Lagos which is owned by their parents. Applicant stayed with them during his three-week visit.</P> 
 
<P>In July 2002, Applicant's father became a US citizen through naturalization. His mother remains a resident alien in the US, although she is pursuing US 
citizenship. Applicant has telephone contact with his father weekly and his mother daily. Applicant has contact with his twin brother either by telephone or in 
person once per week. Applicant's other sister is on active duty in the United States military.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's spouse is a Nigerian citizen who was a family friend. She came to the US in about 1995 and has lived with Applicant since about 1998. As of May 
2003, she was employed in a bank.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully considered according to the pertinent guidelines in making the overall common sense determination  required. 
Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other 
pertinent behavioral changes; the potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in 
the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.  Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it 
should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse 
information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information 
reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable behavior. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">See</SPAN> Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section 
E2.2.4. </P> 
 
<P> Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Italic">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.3. Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.5. A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Foreign Influence</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, 
a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.2. Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in 
question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty 
to the person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Under Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative 
finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the 
Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the 
trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the 
potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the  SOR. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct 
cognizable as a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or 
mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his 
security clearance. A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and 
confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy 
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 
U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Any 
doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 
to the Directive, Section E2.2.2.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Having considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of the Applicant, I conclude the 
following with respect to Guidelines E and B:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a record of deliberate false statements and omissions that reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and creates serious 
personal conduct (Guideline E) concerns. He applied for a rental apartment in April 1997, using his brother's name, social security number, and employment. 
Although Applicant paid for the deposit and rent with checks issued in his correct name, his tenancy was approved based on information that Applicant knew 
was false. That he had his twin's authorization for the misrepresentations does not render his conduct any less dishonest. When confronted by the DSS agent 
with the false rental application, Applicant initially indicated falsely that the application was for an apartment that his twin brother had lived in. Applicant also 
succumbed to the pressure of an ex-girlfriend and falsely claimed paternity of her daughter so the girl would be eligible on his medical insurance policy through 
his employer during the late December 1997 to May 2000 time frame. Applicant's hearing testimony that he thought the girl was his daughter is directly 
contradicted by his repeated denials of paternity when interviewed by the DSS agent, and the fact that he never claimed this girl as a dependent on other forms 
(<EM>e.g.</EM>, tax returns or security clearance applications).  More recently, when Applicant returned to work for the defense contractor, he fraudulently claimed he was 
married on the W-4 form, and therefore entitled to a second withholding allowance. While he and his spouse had been cohabitants since about 1998, he knew 
he was not legally married, as manifested by his indication on his SF 86 that he was single. Although not alleged by the Government, Applicant did not disclose 
on his March 2001QNSP (or the electronic SF 86 prepared from the QNSP) that he was involved in a cohabitant relationship with a Nigerian citizen, who he 
now claims was his common law spouse. He listed only one of his three siblings on his application, concealing from the Government that he had relationships 
of affection with two younger siblings, both Nigerian resident citizens. Disqualifying conditions E2.A5.1.2.2. (deliberate omission, concealment or falsification 
of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . or similar form), E2.A5.1.2.3. (deliberately providing misleading or false 
information to an investigator), and E2.A5.1.2.5. (pattern of dishonesty) are pertinent in this case.</P> 
 
<P>The Government has alleged as well that Applicant deliberately provided false addresses to the DSS agent for his son's mother (Ms. B). A no contact order was 
entered against him following the domestic assault, and there is no proof he had any ongoing contact with Ms. B or even his son except through his church 
acting as an intermediary. By April 2001, Applicant was aware that his son had been taken to Nigeria by a family member of Ms. B, since Applicant's mother 
had paid for the boy's plane ticket. When interviewed in July 2001, Applicant provided an address for Ms. B that did not exist.<A HREF="01-27287.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Given the no contact order,it is 
conceivable Applicant would not know of her address. There is no proof he had any ongoing contact with Ms. B except through his church as an intermediary.  
Aware that his son had been taken to Nigeria by the boy's maternal great-grandmother in April 2001, Applicant notified the DSS agent in November 2001 his 
son was in Nigeria. Based on the evidence of record, I am unable to conclude that Applicant deliberately lied to the agent about Ms. B's whereabouts during his 
2001 interviews.  Subparagraph 1.c. is thus resolved in his favor.</P> 
 
<P>With regard to those proven deliberate misrepresentations on his W-4 form, on his medical benefits documents filed with his previous employer, and on his 
1997 rental application, Applicant has not met his burden in mitigation. He continues to demonstrate little appreciation for the need to be completely honest 
with the Government. When he completed his June 2002 sworn statement, he failed to include his spouse as a foreign national with whom he has a close 
relationship. It was not until the hearing that the Government learned Applicant had married a Nigerian citizen. In March 2003, Applicant filed a joint income 
tax return for tax year 2001 with his spouse, and claimed an exemption for her, even though they were not married at any time during the 2001 tax year.  At his 
hearing, he claimed to have held a belief up to the time that he listed Ms. C's daughter as a dependent on medical benefit forms that he had fathered the girl. His 
recent claim is directly contradicted by his earlier statements to the DSS agent in June 2002 that he did not believe the girl was his daughter and had listed her 
as a dependent at the request of Ms. C who was unemployed at the time. Adverse findings are warranted as to subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b. and 1.d., Applicant 
having to overcome the security concerns caused by these knowingly false statements made in self-interest.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, 
influence or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. Although Applicant's father recently acquired US citizenship, he 
continues to own a home in Nigeria. Applicant's mother is a Nigerian citizen who has been a continuous resident of the US since 1988. At the hearing, the 
Government learned through the testimony of Applicant's twin brother that Applicant is married to a Nigerian citizen--a family friend who came to the US in 
about 1995 and has cohabited with Applicant since about 1998. Applicant clearly has close relationships with these family members. He speaks with his mother 
daily and his father once or twice weekly. It is reasonable to assume close and intimate contact in a spousal relationship. Furthermore, Applicant's younger 
sister and brother are resident citizens of Nigeria. Applicant described this sister as his "primary contact in Nigeria." Applicant stayed with his siblings in the 
family home when he traveled to Nigeria in 1995, late 2000, and March 2003. Disqualifying condition E2.A2.1.2.1., an immediate family member, or a person 
to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country must be considered in evaluating 
Applicant's security suitability.</P> 
 
<P>The security concerns engendered by the foreign citizenship of close family members and associates may be mitigated where it can be determined that the 
immediate family member(s), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States (<EM>see</EM> E2.A2.1.3.1.). Evidence of record does not 
indicate that Applicant's family members have ever been agents of a foreign power, or that they are in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. Applicant's 
father worked for a government-owned oil company before 1988, but there is no evidence he has had any contact with foreign government officials since he 
moved to the US. Although they continue to own the home in Nigeria in which their two youngest children live, Applicant's parents have established significant 
ties in the US. His father acquired US citizenship in July 2002 and his mother is pursuing US citizenship.  Their residency in the US greatly reduces the risk of 
undue foreign influence being placed on them. Applicant's siblings in Nigeria are students not engaged in any political activity. Although Applicant's son was 
in Nigeria from April 2001 to September 2002, the potential foreign influence concerns presented by his son's residency and close contact with Nigerian 
resident nationals are mitigated by the son's return to the US. Although not alleged by the Government, the risk of foreign influence because of Applicant's 
spouse's Nigerian citizenship cannot be ignored. However, she has been a resident of the US since 1995, and there is no indication of contact by her with 
foreign nationals. Given those to whom Applicant has the closest bond are all in the US, and he has clearly chosen the US over Nigeria to make his home and 
career, the risk of foreign influence is minimal, notwithstanding the Nigerian government has a poor human rights record. Subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. are 
resolved in Applicant's favor. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Applicant has denied any intent to defraud the lessor. On direct examination, he testified his brother had the occasion to reside in the apartment for a period of 
days. (Tr. p. 102). Applicant's brother did not confirm that he ever resided in the apartment. He testified he had no intent of going back to the apartment if his 
brother decided to rent it (Tr. p. 154), and did not indicate that he resided there with Applicant. 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>The agent reported in a certified results of interview (Ex.4) that the company's records listed the girl's birth as October 1995. Applicant indicated in a sworn 
statement of June 11, 2002 (Ex. 5), the girl was born in 1994.  
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>Applicant's US passport is not of record. Applicant reports trips to Nigeria in January 1995 and from December 2000 to January 2001. There is no proof 
Applicant's son was in Nigeria prior to April 2001 when he went there with his maternal great-grandmother. It was not established that Applicant showed his 
son around Nigeria during the December 2000/January 2001 time frame. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>It is not clear from the agent's testimony or his certified results of interview (Ex. 4) whether the agent in July 2001 asked Applicant specifically for his son's 
address or just Ms. B's. As of July 2001, Applicant was aware his son was not at the address that he listed on his QNSP. Applicant having revealed on his 
QNSP that he had a son out of wedlock and that he had been placed on probation for domestic assault, he had little reason to lie about Ms. B's address. 
Applicant should have indicated to the DSS agent he was relying on hearsay for the addresses, but his failure to do so does not prove intentional falsification.
