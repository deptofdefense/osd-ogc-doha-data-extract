<P>	Applicant has delinquent debts totaling approximately $27,000.  Although he worked out a

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security 
clearance.  On 25 September 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-18405.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis 
for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the 
Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 3 November 2003 and elected to have a 
hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 13 January 2004.  On 4 
February 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant's attorney entered his 
appearance and moved, on behalf of his client, to have the case decided on the written record in lieu 
of a hearing.  Department Counsel had no objection, and Applicant's motion was granted.  
Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on 13 February 2004.  A complete 
copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on 28 February 2004 and responded on 21 March 2004.  
The case was reassigned to me on 30 March 2004.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 
527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well 
as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. 
Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security 
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the 
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating 
the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative 
process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security 
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 
&sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and 
the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline F that Applicant had seven delinquent debts that 
were placed for collection (&para;&para; 1.a.-1.g.), was indebted to the State for a judgment of over $7,000 (&para; 
1.h.), and indebted to the State for a tax lien in the amount of $3,730 (&para; 1.i.).  An applicant who is 
financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive 
&para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions the debts 
alleged in the SOR.  Applicant denied the debts alleged in &para;&para; 1.d., 1.e., and 1.i.  However, Applicant 
specifically lists the debts alleged in 1.d. on his proposed payment plan.<A HREF="02-18405.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  Item 8 at 18.  The debt 
alleged in &para; 1.e. appears on the credit report he submitted as part of his Answer.  Item 8 at 13.  There 
is no evidence that any of these debts have been paid.  In his interrogatories, dated 30 May 2003, 
Applicant claimed he was going to set up a meeting with the state comptroller to dispute and resolve 
the issue of the state tax lien (&para; 1.i.).  Applicant provided no evidence that he ever set up such a 
meeting or was truly contesting that debt.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is 
unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  Applicant asserts three mitigating 
conditions apply to his case: (1) The behavior was not recent (MC E2.A6.1.3.1.); (2) The conditions 
that resulted in his behavior were beyond his control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3); and (3) Applicant has 
received counseling for his problem and there are clear indications that problem is being resolved 
(MC E2.A6.1.3.4.).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Some of Applicant's debts were not incurred recently.  However, the issue is not when the 
debts were incurred, but whether his behavior (non-payment) was recent.  As the debts remain 
outstanding, MC E2.A6.1.3.1. does not apply.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-3695, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 453 
at *7 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant states his financial difficulties stem from the 1999 failure of his business and the 
illness of his parents.  His father eventually died in June 2003.  Item 5 at 1; Response to FORM at 
2-3.  He claims he spent more than $18,000 supporting his siblings and parents during his father's 
illness.  But Applicant received financial counseling in May 2003 and completed a list of his 
expenses in which he specifically denied any payments to family and friends.  Item 8 at 22.  
Applicant failed to provide any corroborating evidence of this support.  Although the evidence 
supports a conclusion Applicant's business failure contributed to his financial situation, he has not 
shown that he was incapable of paying these debts.  I conclude MC E2.A6.1.3.3. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant received counseling for his financial problems-and a somewhat favorable 
prognosis from the credit counselor that he had sufficient funds to pay his debts with a payment 
plan-but there is no indication that Applicant's problems are being resolved.  He provided no 
evidence to demonstrate that he is making the recommended payments, or any payments at all, even 
though his financial plan showed he had over $500 a month available after paying his monthly bills.  
I conclude MC E2.A6.1.3.4. does not apply.</SPAN></P>
