</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 29 July 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 22 August 2005 and requested a hearing. 
DOHA assigned the case to me 8 June 2006 and I convened a hearing 18 September 2006. DOHA received the transcript 27 September 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. Accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 35-year-old senior consultant employed by a 
defense contractor since July 2000, seeking to retain his industrial clearance. He previously held a clearance since about 1990, while attending college on a 
military scholarship and serving his active-duty obligation following graduation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From about 1993 to April 2002, Applicant downloaded, viewed and saved pornographic images on his computer (G.E. 2, 4). Initially, he downloaded these 
images manually, but later subscribed to various on-line newsgroups that would scan the internet for pornographic images and automatically download them to 
his computer. Applicant periodically reviewed these images, saving the images that interested him and deleting the rest. He estimates that his collection was 
63,000 images by April 2002. Of these 63,000 images, Applicant estimates that about 100 images were of naked girls under age 18, collected between about 
1998 and April 2002. These images included short video clips of adults engaging in sexual acts with minors.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's exotic interests were not limited to internet pornography.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Between 1994 and 2001, he used a radio scanner to eavesdrop on neighbors' cordless 
telephone calls. Sometimes he tape-recorded the conversations so he could listen to them later. He continued to eavesdrop on conversations even after Federal 
law made it illegal to sell scanners capable of such eavesdropping; he modified a scanner to defeat modifications made by the vendor to comply with Federal 
law. During this same period (approximately 1994 to 2000), Applicant took photographs of Mardi Gras revelers in New Orleans exposing their breasts and 
otherwise "flashing" fellow revelers. By Applicant's own admission, these revelers may have included minor females. Applicant posted these photographs and 
videos to his website, and offered them for sale. Until about June 2003, he illegally downloaded copyrighted music and movies from the internet, and shared 
them with others, albeit not for money.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's conduct was discovered in May 2002, when he underwent a lifestyle polygraph  required for him to obtain access to special compartmented 
information (SC I) with a government agency. As a result of the ensuing investigation, the government agency denied Applicant's request for access to SCI 
(G.E. 3, 4). He appealed (G.E. 7), but the original decision was affirmed (G.E. 5, 6). In anticipation of his polygraph, Applicant deleted all the pornographic 
images from his computer. He took the photographs and videos off his website around February 2004 (Tr. 61).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In an effort to obtain his SCI access, Applicant consulted a psychologist between August 2003 and January 2004 (A.E. B), to deal with what Applicant had 
described at one point as his "addiction" to pornography (Tr. 34-35). This practitioner concluded that Applicant suffered from a sexual disorder not otherwise 
specified, but opined (in September 2005) that there was no impediment to Applicant being granted access to classified information. However, he did not 
indicate what evidence he relied upon in reaching that conclusion. The forensic psychiatrist Applicant consulted in preparation for this hearing (Tr. 53) reached 
a similar conclusion (A.E. A), but was not available to be cross-examined on his conclusions, which were based on at least three documents (numbers 1, 4, and 
5 in his report) that were not a part of the record at hearing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant testified that he spends 1-2 hours a week viewing pornography on line, because it brings him joy (Tr. 73, 89). He has to go looking for it directly 
because he no longer subscribes to the newsgroups that he previously used to collect the images. He claims that his current girlfriend knows about his viewing 
internet pornography.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant thinks of his interest in pornography as legal, except where it involved images of minors. He justified possession of some 
images of minors  as artistic images from recognized photographers. He thought it "technically legal" to modify his scanner to do something it had been 
equipped by the vendor to prohibit (Tr. 90-92). Where he acknowledges the illegality of his conduct, he believes that the criminal conduct is less serious 
because he never sold pornographic images or copyrighted material. Aside from his girlfriend, he does not indicate who else may be aware of his past conduct. 
There are no character references in the record.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct), and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima 
facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a 
security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline D by demonstrating that Applicant engaged downloaded, viewed, and saved 
pornographic images--including pornographic images of minors involved in sexual acts with adults--from about 1993 to April 2003.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant 
acknowledged that he was diagnosed as suffering from a sexual disorder not otherwise specified, and at one time considered himself addicted to pornography.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  
Although Applicant claims that he is not in a position to be exploited, it does not appear that knowledge of his past conduct is known outside government 
personnel involved in his clearance adjudications.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His conduct betrays a significant lack of discretion and judgment.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The expert's report does little to help Applicant's cause. Even if I accept the expert's medical conclusions under Guideline D and Guideline I (Emotional, 
ental, and Personality Disorders) regarding Applicant's current condition, there are many reasons for discounting his report. First, I am not bound by his 
conclusions regarding the security significance of Applicant's conduct. Second, he apparently relied on documents provided to him by Applicant that were not 
otherwise part of the record in this case. Finally, his unavailability for cross-examination undercuts his credibility, particularly where he was consulted solely to 
provide a report for introduction at hearing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The conclusions of the report notwithstanding, Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his sexual behavior. The most serious conduct 
occurred when Applicant was not an adolescent,<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> he continues to view pornography regularly, and we have only his uncorroborated testimony that he does 
not view illegal pornography, or does not view pornography more frequently than he says. Even if I accept that Applicant stopped viewing illegal pornography 
in 2003, that conduct is still recent.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Further, his sexual behavior is not the only evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  
His downloading and sharing copyrighted material and his eavesdropping demonstrate additional irresponsibility and poor judgment. Finally, even accepting 
that Applicant has stopped his most egregious conduct, he has not demonstrated that his past conduct does not serve as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or 
duress.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I resolve Guideline D against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline J by demonstrating that Applicant possessed and viewed pornographic images of 
minors, illegally downloaded and shared copyrighted material, and modified his radio scanner to permit eavesdropping on frequencies it was otherwise 
prohibited from scanning.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's suggestion that it is only illegal for a vendor to sell a scanner capable of scanning those frequencies, but not illegal for 
him to modify a scanner to scan those prohibited frequencies, is specious.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His criminal conduct was both recent and not isolated.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> He claims clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation,<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> but there is no corroboration of his claims anywhere in the record. Similarly, he was not pressured or coerced into 
committing the criminal acts,<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and his conduct was entirely voluntary.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Further, given that he continues to view on-line pornography 1-2 hours a week, I 
cannot conclude that the factors leading to the conduct</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> are unlikely to recur. I resolve Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline E</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Even accepting that taking 
the Mardi Gras photographs and videos was legal, publishing them on his website and seeking to profit by them, demonstrates extraordinarily poor judgement 
inconsistent with access to classified information.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> By itself, this conduct might not warrant a negative clearance decision, but coupled with the misconduct in 
paragraph 1 and 2 above, most of which appears to be unknown outside the government, leaves Applicant potentially subject to coercion.<A HREF="04-07861.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Criminality aside, 
Applicant's voyeuristic behavior in a variety of venues is not consistent with the requirements for access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against 
Applicant.</SPAN></P>
