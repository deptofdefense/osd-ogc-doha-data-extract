<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Security concerns were raised regarding a 53-year-old Vietnam-born naturalized U.S. citizen
Applicant--who, with his mother (now deceased), managed to escape the communist forces in April
1975 by fleeing Saigon aboard his Vietnamese Navy small boat.  His Vietnam-born wife and her
entire family are naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S.  They have three U.S.-born children. 
His brother--a permanent U.S. alien--is a citizen of SRVN who resides in the U.S.  Applicant

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On November 5, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and
modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In a sworn written statement, dated November 20, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR
allegations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on March 30, 2004.  A notice of
hearing was issued that same day scheduling the hearing for April 20, 2004.  It was held as
scheduled.  During the hearing, two government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and the testimony
of three Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was
received on May 17, 2004.</P>

Applicant signed the SF 86, and in so doing, certified that his response was true, complete, and

acknowledged that she had forgotten the travel and did not intend to hide the truth.<A HREF="02-27719.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  Applicant also

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The government of RVN collapsed in 1975, coinciding with the establishment of the
Communist SRVN.  Full diplomatic relations were established between the U.S. and SRVN in 1995,
and, in 2001, a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries finally commenced.  Under that
agreement, <EM>temporary</EM>--later modified to <EM>conditional</EM>--normal trade relations (formerly known as
most-favored nation status) were extended by the U.S.  SRVN has also given the U.S. modest
support in the war against terrorism.  While SRVN has a Communist totalitarian government which
seemingly encourages technology transfers from the Vietnamese expatriate intellectuals abroad, the
Department Counsel has offered no evidence to indicate SRVN conducts intelligence operations or
economic espionage against the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER>
</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in
the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each
guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding
whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information
(Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules
of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when applied
in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section
E.2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair
and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the
"whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative
Process factors which an administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at
the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or
recurrence.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative
guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>	GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an
individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she
may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States
or (2) may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens
of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security
determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or
pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>	GUIDELINE E - PERSONAL CONDUCT:  Conduct involving questionable judgment,
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified
information.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>	</STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those
which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to both adjudicative guidelines are set forth and
discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision
in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly
consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-27719.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." 
For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards
are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are
reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided
drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the
government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified
information.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the
applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that
the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,
consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect
or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism
are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover
many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this
decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any
express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony,
demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts and factors,
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set
forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed
as a person who is a potential security risk because his brother is a citizen of SRVN residing in the
U.S. and may be subject to duress.  This situation raises the potential for vulnerability to coercion,
exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise
of classified information.  The citizenship status of Applicant's brother, when considered in light of
the nature of the government in SRVN--a Communist totalitarian country that is no longer involved
in open military hostilities with the United States, and whose interests are not necessarily inimical
to the United States, and currently is engaged in normal trade relations with the U.S.--facilitates an
analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions set forth therein. 
Only the continuing SRVN citizenship of his brother raises the issue of potential foreign influence. 
These facts activate Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate
family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a
citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC)
E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons,
daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual
to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  After an examination
of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's brother, considering his citizenship and residency status,
does not constitute an unacceptable security risk.  His brother has been a permanent resident alien
of the U.S. since 1997, and appears to be a risk to no one.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The government's only other alleged foreign influence concern relates to Applicant's having
taken three trips to SRVN in the past 11 years--actions which it asserts raises FI DC E2.A2.1.2.6.
(<EM>conduct which may make the individual vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by a
foreign government</EM>).  By the very nature of the investigative inquiry into Applicant's background,
the government is unconcerned about travel to foreign countries which occurred over seven years
ago.  Thus, Applicant's 1993 trip to SRVN was clearly unimportant in the overall scheme of things. 
An analysis of the potential vulnerability to Applicant because of any of his two other trips reveals
little such vulnerability as he has no immediate family in SRVN through whom coercion,
exploitation, or pressure could be exerted.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's absence of foreign investments or financial interests, including bank accounts
or real estate, in SRVN, raises FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (<EM>foreign financial interests are minimal and not
sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>).  Applicant did not simply casually
relocate from his home in Saigon, but managed to escape the communist forces by fleeing the city
in his Vietnamese Navy boat.  His "financial interests" were worn on his back when he fled the
country, not invested there.  On the other hand, his diligence and hard work have enabled him to
reach the plateau where his U.S. holdings are significant and he has educated his three sons.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation,
successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to Guideline B.
Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	At first glance it appears the government has established its case under Guideline E.  On
February 14, 2002, Applicant signed an SF 86 and denied having traveled outside the U.S. during
the preceding seven years.  In fact, he had traveled to SRVN on two occasions within that seven year
window.  The guideline addresses omissions, concealment, or falsification which is deliberate.  In
this instance, I conclude that Applicant neither intentionally nor willfully lied, falsified, omitted, or
concealed his overseas travel.  None of the Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions apply.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The evidence before me clearly indicates Applicant's wife completed the SF 86 and he
merely signed it.  She forgot Applicant's overseas travel and he neglected to check the accuracy of
the responses.  Considering Applicant's difficulty with English proficiency, and the fact that his
security manager was aware of his overseas travel, Applicant would have nothing to gain by
deliberately omitting the correct information on his SF 86.  Under these circumstances, I believe
Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully rebutted and overcome
the government's case with respect to Guideline E.  Accordingly, allegation 2.a. of the SOR is
concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
