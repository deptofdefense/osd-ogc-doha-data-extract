<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN>has had a long history of financial difficulties, including debts to 30 creditors.  These debts have not been resolved by the filing of a bankruptcy.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN>Applicant's criminal activity includes being charged and found guilty of simple assault in 2000, and having a bench warrant issued for his arrest for failing to 
pay for a vehicle violation in 2001. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant knew or should have known that the information that he provided to the Government in a Security Clearance

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated March 22, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing 
record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on June 28, 2003, because of medical consideration, the case was reassigned to this 
Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A </SPAN>Notice of Hearing<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was issued to the parties on July 28, 2003, and the hearing was 
held on August 13, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-8) and no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, 
offered four documentary exhibits (Exhibits A-D) and offered his own testimony. After the hearing, the record was left open, and  Applicant offered a 
documentary exhibit regarding his bankruptcy, consisting of 42 pages (Exhibit  E), which was not objected to by Department Counsel and has been entered into 
evidence. </SPAN>The transcript (TR) was received on<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> August 25, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations (subparagraphs 1.a - 1.dd). Applicant neither admitted nor denied the SOR allegations for paragraphs 2 
and 3. At the beginning of the hearing, Applicant was asked about the additional allegations in the SOR. Applicant admitted allegations (subparagraphs 2.a - 2.c 
and 3.a-3.c) </SPAN>(TR at 10-12)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Therefore, through his response to the SOR and his testimony, Applicant admitted all thirty six allegations. These allegations are 
incorporated by reference as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony of Applicant at the hearing, and 
the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><STRONG><CENTER></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P> Applicant is a 31 year old employee of a defense contractor, and he has a tenth grade education.<STRONG> </STRONG>He is married and has two sons.</P> 
 
<P>T<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> lists 30 debts that Applicant admitted owing as of October 24, 2002, 1.a. through 1.dd under Adjudicative Guideline F .  These debts were all long 
overdue, most for several years.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant testified that he had filed bankruptcy on August 6, 2003, but his debts had not yet been discharged through the bankruptcy.  Applicant 
cited all of his debts as being included in his bankruptcy, except the debts listed as SOR allegations 1.b, 1.d, and 1.l. Applicant testified that the outstanding 
debt 1.b of the SOR, in the amount of $249.50, was not included on the bankruptcy and had not been paid </SPAN>(TR at 28, 29)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant testified that debt 1.d, in 
the amount of $360, was paid in 1998 </SPAN>(TR at 30, 31)<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant had no documentation to establish that this debt was paid, and his testimony conflicts with his 
response to the SOR that this debt was still owing as of  October 24, 2002. Debt 1.l, in the amount of $255.39 was for five checks written with insufficient 
funds.  Applicant confirmed at the hearing that this debt had been paid  </SPAN>(TR at 38, 39)<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 2  (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts. Applicant's conduct that occurred 
in 1993, 2000, and 2001, and which has been alleged  in the SOR as 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. respectively, is included  in this paragraph as criminal conduct.</SPAN><STRONG> </STRONG>These 
charges include being arrested and charged with assault in 1993, being charged and found guilty of simple assault in 2000, and having a bench warrant issued 
for his arrest for failing to pay for a vehicle violation in 2001.<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant completed a signed, sworn <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN> on November 9, 2001.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #26 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? 
Applicant answered "no" to this question. The evidence shows that Applicant was arrested and convicted in January 2000 for simple assault. Applicant should 
have answered "yes" to this question and included this arrest in the response to question #26.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #38 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" Applicant answered yes to this question and listed one debt, 
which was the debt listed as 1.a of the SOR. At the time he completed the SCA, </SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was delinquent on all of the debts discussed above, and he should 
have answered "yes" to this question and included all of the debts listed in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question #39 asks, "Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt (s)?" Applicant answered no to this question. At the time he completed the SCA, 
</SPAN>Applicant<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> was delinquent on all of the debts discussed above, and he should have answered "yes" to this question and included all of the debts listed in the 
SOR.</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully 
considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising 
or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P>

often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of furthis processing for clearance eligibility:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.2. None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's indebtedness. It shows Applicant has a history 
of financial difficulties. Twenty seven of Applicant's debts were included in the bankruptcy, which was filed on August 6, 2003 (Exhibit E). However, the debts 
had not been discharged at the time of the close of evidence.  Since, a bankruptcy may end without resolving all of the debts listed on it, I cannot conclude that 
these debts were or will be discharged. Additionally, based on applicant's testimony, I conclude debt 1.b has not yet been resolved.  Finally, regarding debt 1.d, 
Applicant had no documentation to establish that this debt was paid, and his testimony conflicts with his admission in the SOR response that this debt was still 
owing as of October 24, 2002. Applicant has failed to establish that this debt is no longer outstanding. The only debt, listed in the SOR, that I can conclude has 
been paid is 1.l.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3. I find that no Mitigating Condition (MC) is applicable to this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appears to have finally made a good-faith effort to resolve his indebtedness. However, since the vast majority of Applicant's debts have not been 
resolved, I cannot conclude that Applicant's financial problems are behind him. Until his debts are paid, and he can establish a record of financial responsibility 
and stability, security concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve Guideline F. against Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant was arrested for, or convicted of, three criminal offenses</SPAN>. These incidents have resulted in 
criminal conduct from 1993 until 2001.   DC E2.A10.1.2. and DC E2.A10.1.2.1. apply in this case.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2 is 
found against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>With respect to Guidelines E, the evidence establishes that Applicant intentionally provided false material information to the Government in response to three 
questions on the SCA he executed in August 2001. The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's 
secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that he 
nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness required of clearance holders. In this case, Applicant's falsifications of his SCA occurred 
approximately two years ago, and his failure to offer any independent evidence indicating that he has reformed and is now reliable and trustworthy, precludes a 
finding that it is now clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN>applies<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> because the information </SPAN>that Applicant provided in 
his SCA was known or should have been known by him to be <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">an omission and concealment of relevant and material </SPAN>facts.  No MCs apply.</P>
