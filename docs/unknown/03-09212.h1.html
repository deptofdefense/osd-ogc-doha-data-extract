<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's demonstrated sexual behavior and poor judgement disqualify him for a security clearance. Clearance denied.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 14 October 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation 
of his clearance because of sexual behavior and personal conduct.<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 26 October 2003, initially requested an administrative 
decision, but in July 2004 requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 27 August 2004 and I convened a hearing on 13 December 2004. DOHA 
received the transcript on 21 December 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the Guide D allegation and all the Guideline E allegations except 2.a.; accordingly, I incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a 
42-year-old senior principal  employed by a defense contractor since May 1993, seeking to retain the industrial clearance he has held since approximately 1991.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In late 1996, Applicant became enamored with on-line chat rooms. During this time, he and his wife of sixteen years were experiencing marital difficulties. 
Applicant met a woman twelve years his junior on-line. She was a citizen of the United Kingdom (UK) living in the U.S. for a year as an au pair. They met in 
person and began a 3-4 week affair, during which time they had sexual relations three times. They had intimate contact at Applicant's office,<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and sexual 
relations at a hotel. The affair lasted until the middle of January 1997, when it ended by mutual consent. Applicant had e-mail contact with the au pair until she 
returned to the UK in February 1997, at the end of her au-pair year. He last had contact with her by e-mail sometime in 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife was unaware of this affair until sometime after December 2001. Applicant and his wife went through marital counseling between December 
2001 and June 2002 (AE A), during which time Applicant asserts that his wife "became aware of the relationship, but not of specific details (Answer)." In 
December 2004, Applicant's wife stated her knowledge of the affair in a single sentence: "I have full knowledge of my husband's extra-marital affair that took 
place during several weeks in Dec (sic) 1996 and Jan (sic) 1997." (AE A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant speaks a number of foreign languages, including Russian. He began learning Russian at a community college and with a private tutor in 1988-1989 
(GE 2) and attended the Defense Language Institute from June 1990 to July 1991 while in the Army (GE 1). In 1999, he discovered Russian-language chat 
rooms on the internet and began to use them to maintain his proficiency in Russian. From July 2001 to September 2001, he attended a language school in 
Ukraine to learn Ukranian and strengthen his Russian (GE 2, AE B). He maintains monthly/bi-monthly contacts with several Ukranians he met while in 
language school. He asserts that none of these foreign contacts have ever queried him about his work as a defense contractor. He continues to visit Russian-language chat rooms (GE 4). He has not advised his company security officers about his on-going chat room contacts with foreign nationals (Tr. 65).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had his special access revoked by another government agency in October 2000 after multiple polygraphs because of his affair with the foreign 
national and his continuing contacts with foreign nationals by e-mail and in internet chat rooms.<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline D case by demonstrating that Applicant engaged </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in an adulterous affair<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> that his wife was unaware of until at least December 2001 and may not be fully aware of now.<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> This affair occurred at work and other 
public places.<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his sexual behavior. While the behavior occurred several years ago and has not recurred,<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant 
was not an adolescent and was substantially older than his paramour. His wife's one-sentence statement that she is fully aware of the circumstances of the affair 
is undercut by Applicant's statement that she was not aware of the specifics, suggesting that he may still be subject to coercion, exploitation, or duress. In any 
event Applicant has the burden of demonstrating that he cannot be influenced by his past sexual behavior and he has done so only partially at best .<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I resolve 
Guideline D against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline E case and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His adulterous affair, undertaken a matter of days after his 
first contact with this foreign national and in public places, demonstrates extraordinarily poor judgement inconsistent with access to classified information<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and 
leaves him potentially subject to coercion.<A HREF="03-09212.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His on-going contacts with foreign nationals by e-mail and in chat rooms provides a potential avenue to elicit 
information, a risk of which Applicant remains largely unaware or unconcerned. The internet contacts raise even greater security concerns because internet chat 
rooms are an environment where it is impossible to know the true identity of the person you are dealing with. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
