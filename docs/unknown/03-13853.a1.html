  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  There is no right to have the record kept open continuously so that a party can offer additional evidence for consideration in the case.  Board does not re-try a case on appeal, but rather reviews an Administrative Judge's decision to determine whether a  party has identified factual or legal error.  Applicant has failed to raise any identifiable claim of error by the Judge.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 29, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Kathryn Moen Braeman issued an unfavorable security clearance 
decision, dated January 11, 2005.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issue has been raised on appeal: whether the Board should reverse the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision based on 
the information presented by Applicant on appeal.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge made findings of fact and reached conclusions about each of the SOR allegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and concluded that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-13853.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On appeal, Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings of fact or conclusions.  However, Applicant does offer some new evidence and 
copies of some record evidence pertaining to the matters covered by SOR paragraphs 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 2.b, 2.g, and 3, as well as a recent letter from his supervisor.  
Applicant's appeal submission raises the issue of whether the Board should reverse the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision based on 
the information presented by Applicant on appeal.</P> 
<P>The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Applicant had the opportunity to submit 
documentary evidence for the Administrative Judge to consider in his case, and he took advantage of that opportunity by submitting documentation in response 
to the File of Relevant Material.  There is no right to have the record kept open continuously so that a party can offer additional evidence for consideration in 
the case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-21274 (January 8, 2004) at p. 3 (citing <EM>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 
Inc</EM>., 435 U.S. 519, 554-555 (1978)).</P> 
<P>Applicant has failed to raise any identifiable claim of factual or legal error by the Administrative Judge.  Rather, Applicant is asking the Board to make a 
decision of its own concerning the merits of his case.  The Board does not re-try a case on appeal, but rather reviews a Judge's decision to determine whether an 
appeal party has identified factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.</P> 
<P>As discussed earlier in this decision, there is no presumption of error below and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity.  Because 
Applicant has failed to raise any identifiable claim of error by the Administrative Judge, the Board need not review the Judge's factual findings, conclusions, or 
legal rulings to determine whether they are sustainable under the appeal standards set forth in the Directive.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision because Applicant has not raised any identifiable claim of error below.</P>
