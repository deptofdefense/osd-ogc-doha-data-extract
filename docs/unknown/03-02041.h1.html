<P>Applicant was born in Egypt but is now a naturalized U.S. citizen. His parents, siblings, wife, and her parents are all citizens of Egypt. His wife is now a 
permanent resident alien in the U.S., but one sister lives in Canada, and the rest of Applicant's family and his in-laws live in Egypt. Applicant travels to Egypt 
frequently, owns property there to use when he visits, and wants to retain his Egyptian citizenship for cultural reasons. He has failed to present information to 
mitigate the resulting security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On December 15, 2003, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR 
informed Applicant that DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding, based on available information, that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>On January 21, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), wherein he admitted all but one<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> of the allegations and chose to have his case decided without 
a hearing. On May 13, 2004, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a 
copy of which Applicant received on May 20, 2004. Applicant was afforded 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file a response and submit additional 
supporting information, but he did not do so. The evidentiary record closed on June 24, 2004, and the case was assigned to me on July 9, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 33 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He requires a security clearance in connection with his employment. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Egypt in 1970. He came to the U.S. in 1992 on a student visa. In 1995, he won an immigration lottery and was given permanent resident 
alien status. In 1997, he returned to Egypt to study for one year. Since returning in 1998, Applicant has worked as an electrical engineer. He was naturalized as a 
U.S. citizen in February 2001, but does not wish to renounce his Egyptian citizenship for cultural reasons.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is a retired Egyptian army officer and electrical engineer. His mother is a hospital administrator. Both parents are citizens of and live in 
Egypt. Applicant has two sisters, both of whom are Egyptian citizens. Both are teachers, one in Canada and one still in Egypt. The latter sister is engaged to a 
naturalized American citizen originally from Egypt and plans to move to the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens of and live in Egypt. He is a doctor and she teaches college accounting. Neither has any apparent 
connection to the Egyptian government.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant traveled back to Egypt for personal reasons six times between October 1995 and August 2001. He also bought a condominium there at the behest of 
his wife's family as they wanted to ensure he and his wife would come back to Egypt to visit at least annually. Applicant paid $7,000 down and makes semi-annual payments of $1,800 (or about $250 monthly) through his mother in Egypt.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of all of available relevant and material 
information, and application of the pertinent factors and criteria provided in Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Further, the Administrative Judge must consider as 
appropriate the "whole person" factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not 
determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against 
them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having 
reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed in the Directive under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> for an applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Because no one 
has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Under Guideline B, a</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence increasing the risk of compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges that Applicant has foreign ties of affection through his wife (SOR 2.a), his parents (SOR 2.b), his wife's parents (SOR 2.c) and his sisters 
(SOR 2.d). Also alleged as evidence of possible foreign influence are his recent purchase of property in Egypt at the behest of his wife's parents (SOR 2.e) and 
his frequent travel since 1995 back to Egypt (SOR 2.f). Applicant denied the allegation in SOR 2.a on grounds that his wife, while still an Egyptian citizen, is 
also now a permanent resident alien in the U.S. and is eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship in 2008. He admitted the remaining SOR allegations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel has established, through Applicant's admissions to these allegations and through the FORM and its enclosures, a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for 
disqualification under Guideline B. The record supports application of disqualifying condition (DC) 1.<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's immediate family is comprised of Egyptian 
citizens. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even were I to exclude the fact that his wife is a permanent resident alien here and his sisters have both left Egypt, Applicant still has close ties of 
affection to his parents and his wife's parents in Egypt. These facts support a finding the Applicant or his relatives may be subject to coercion by the a foreign 
government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On the facts in this case, the only available mitigating condition (MC) potentially available to Applicant is MC 1;<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> however, Applicant must show that his 
foreign ties of affection are not agents of or otherwise connected to a foreign government, <EM>and</EM> that they are not vulnerable to exploitation by a foreign 
government in a way that would affect Applicant's commitment to protecting U.S. classified information. Applicant has not met his burden of proof on this 
issue. He has shown only that, except for his father's status as a retired senior Egyptian military officer, none of his family is connected with the Egyptian 
government. His wife is now a permanent resident alien, but still has strong ties to her family in Egypt, as shown by Applicant's purchase of a condominium 
there to satisfy his wife's family that he will bring her back to Egypt for future visits. Applicant's foreign ties of affection clearly  extend to his wife's family. 
Because of his father's status and absent other information to support application of both prongs of MC 1, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the 
security concerns engendered by his ties of affection in Egypt. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude Guideline B against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had the opportunity to respond to the FORM and present information to be considered in this regard. He did not avail himself of that opportunity, so I 
am limited to consideration of his Answer to the SOR and the information submitted in the FORM. In particular, I note that Applicant does not wish to 
renounce his Egyptian citizenship for cultural reasons. Renunciation of one's foreign citizenship is not required to receive a security clearance and dual 
citizenship is not illegal. Indeed, it is only addressed as a mitigating condition under Guideline C, not at issue here. Nonetheless, in weighing the record 
evidence as a whole, Applicant's affirmative statement to government investigators about his foreign citizenship bears security significance and cannot be 
ignored here as it serves to underscore his close ties to his family in Egypt. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A fair and commonsense assessment<A HREF="03-02041.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> of Applicant's foreign ties of affection raises reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to safeguard classified 
information unfettered by foreign influence. Such conflicting interests might hinder his ability to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected 
of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial information to resolve those doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I conclude the 
record evidence shows Applicant has not overcome the information supporting the government's decision to deny Applicant access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
