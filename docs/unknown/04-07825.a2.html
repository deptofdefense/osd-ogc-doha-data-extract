<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 18, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)(Directive).  Applicant requested a determination based on the written record, as opposed to a hearing. On October 31, 2005, 
after reviewing Department Counsel's File of Relevant Material and Applicant's response to it, Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant's 
request for a security clearance.  Applicant initially appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  The Board remanded the case to the 
Administrative Judge with instructions on January 18, 2006.  The Judge issued an unfavorable  Remand Decision on February 8, 2006.  Applicant now appeals 
the Judge's Remand Decision.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision, which was based on Applicant's history 
of problems with alcohol, failed to properly consider Applicant's recent history of sobriety and the positive changes in his life.     </P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's findings were not challenged on appeal.  Those include the following: Applicant consumed alcohol from 1981 until at least 
November 2004. Applicant was arrested and convicted of DUI in January 1981 after consuming 12 beers at a party.  He quit drinking briefly but resumed and 
was soon drinking 10 to 12 beers over a five hour period each Friday and Saturday night, a pattern that continued until 1985.  In 1985 Applicant started 
drinking every night, a pattern which included 4 or 5 beers per night during the week and 10 to 12 beers per night on the weekends.  In 1988, after Applicant 
realized he had a drinking problem he was admitted to a hospital  for six weeks of in-patient treatment.  He successfully completed the program and attended 
AA for a time.  Applicant stopped attending AA in 1995 or 1996 because he thought he had solved his alcohol problem.  However, in 1997 he resumed 
drinking again with his old pattern of nightly drinking and heavier drinking on the weekends.  In July 2001, Applicant was again admitted to a hospital to treat 
acute alcohol withdrawal and dehydration.  He was diagnosed as suffering from alcohol abuse.  He was discharged on July 30, 2001 with recommendations for 
AA and aftercare program attendance.  Applicant attended AA for 90 days, then went to 4 or 5 meetings a week until October 2001.  He then moved to another 
state and began drinking about 10 days later.  Applicant began his current pattern of drinking one or two nights a week, consuming one or two beers.  He 
continues to attend AA and realizes that he has an alcohol problem and should not drink.  Applicant told a government investigator in May 2003 that he 
intended to stop drinking immediately but he admitted in his answer to the SOR that he continued to drink until at least March 2004.  His latest admission is 
that he stopped drinking in November 2004, but there is no substantiation of his claim.  </P> 
 
<P>Citing Applicant's significant history of problems with alcohol, including a diagnosis of alcohol abuse, habitual consumption, and inability to cease drinking 
after two alcohol treatment hospitalizations, the Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant was unable to support his latest claim of abstinence and, though 
well-meaning, Applicant does not have sufficient control over his drinking problem to instill confidence in his professions of future sobriety.  The Judge 
concluded that the government's security concerns over Applicant's alcohol consumption had not been mitigated.  </P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant emphasizes that he has been sober for over a year and a half and that positive changes in his life, most importantly a new marriage, have 
enabled him to an upstanding and alcohol-free life, and that his past is behind him.  Applicant claims that he is being unfairly judged solely on his long-ago past 
and not on his present circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal brief contains some references to changed life circumstances (a former bad marriage and a current happy one) that were not part of the 
record below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.29.  Applicant's representations that he had ceased all alcohol 
consumption as of November 2004 was evidence that the Administrative Judge was required to consider.    However, the Judge was not required to accept that 
evidence and find that Applicant has, indeed, entered a period of unblemished sobriety since November 2004.  Given the record evidence of Applicant's 
relapses into heavy alcohol use after brief periods of sobriety, and the record evidence of Applicant's inability to refrain from continuing use of alcohol after his 
stated intentions of forbearance after certain dates, the Judge's finding that Applicant had failed to establish his current claimed period of abstinence in the 
absence of corroborating evidence was reasonably supported by the record.  An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an 
ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's finding is unsustainable.  Regarding the Judge's 
ultimate conclusion that Applicant failed to mitigate the concerns raised by his history of problems with alcohol, the Board concludes that the Judge's ultimate 
disposition of the case is supported by the record.  Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance.    </P>
