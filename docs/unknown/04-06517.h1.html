<P>Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the security concern stemming from his history  of financial problems, which are ongoing. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 25, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security 
concern under Guideline F for financial considerations. Applicant replied to the SOR on or about June 10, 2004, and he requested a hearing. The case was 
assigned to me September 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on September 16, 2004, scheduling the hearing for October 27, 2004. Applicant appeared 
without counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. I left the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters, those matters were timely 
received, and are admitted into the record evidence, collectively, as Exhibit P. DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 5, 2004. Issuing a decision 
in this case was delayed due to a heavy caseload. </P> 
<P><CENTER> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old man who is a native-born U.S. citizen. He works as a security guard for a company that provides security services for a defense 
contractor. He seeking a security clearance in conjunction with this employment. </P> 
<P>The background investigation of Applicant revealed a history of delinquent indebtedness. </P> 
<P>The SOR alleges that Applicant received a discharge of more than $26,000.00 in debt under Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, has ten accounts in a collection 
or charged off status, and lacks sufficient income to pay his delinquent debts. These matters are discussed below.</P> 
<P>SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 7 petition in July 1996 to eliminate debt so they could 
qualify for a mortgage loan. The bankruptcy petition listed more than $26,000.00 in liabilities. The bankruptcy court granted Applicant and his wife a discharge 
in October 1996. Subsequently, Applicant and his wife obtained a mortgage loan and bought a home, which has since been foreclosed upon and will be 
discussed below.  </P> 
<P>The debt of $239.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.b is based on a revolving credit line, which has been placed for collection. Applicant admits this is his account, 
and it remains unpaid. </P> 
<P>The debt of $92.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.c is based on telephone account, which has been placed for collection. Applicant does not deny the account, but 
contends it is paid. Applicant did not present documentary evidence that this account is paid.</P> 
<P>The debt of $992.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.d is based on a bank credit card account, which has been charged off. Applicant admits this is his account, and it 
remains unpaid. </P> 
<P>The debt of $4,356.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.e is based on a bank credit card account, which has been charged off. Applicant admits this is his account, and 
it remains unpaid.</P> 
<P>The debt of $3,652 alleged in subparagraph 1.f is based on a bank credit card account, which has been charged off. Applicant admits this is his account, and it 
remains unpaid.</P> 
<P>The debt of $1,622.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.g is based on a medical account, which has been placed for collection. Applicant admits this is his account, and 
it remains unpaid.</P> 
<P>The debt of $190.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.h. is based on a dental account, which has been placed for collection. Applicant admits this is his account, and it 
remains unpaid.</P> 
<P>The debt of $27.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.i is based on a telephone account, which has been charged off. Applicant admits this is his account, and it is paid 
(Exhibits C and P at p. 7).</P> 
<P>The debt of $133.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.j is based on a telephone account, which has been placed for collection. Applicant does not deny the account, but 
contends it is paid. Applicant did not present documentary evidence that this account is paid.</P> 
<P>The debt of $85,801.00 alleged in subparagraph 1.k is based on a balance due owed on a mortgage loan that was foreclosed upon in 2003. Applicant admits this 
is his account, and it remains unpaid. The mortgage loan was joint liability between Applicant and his wife. When Applicant moved out of the house due to 
undue family discord and relocated to another state in 2002, his wife told him she would pay the mortgage loan. She did not, and Applicant was unaware the 
property was foreclosed upon until the subject was brought up during his background investigation. </P> 
<P>The matter alleged in subparagraph 1.l is that a personal financial statement (Exhibit 2 at p. 6) executed by Applicant in December 2003 showing he had a 
negative monthly net remainder of $297.00, which did not include repayment of the delinquent debts discussed above. Applicant does not dispute this matter.</P> 
<P>In addition to the debts discussed above, Applicant presented documentary proof that he has resolved some other debts. Exhibit D shows Applicant paid 
$763.54 to resolve a credit card debt. Likewise, Exhibits M and N are proof Applicant has resolved two medical bills that were placed for collection. </P> 
<P>Applicant is still married to his wife, but he wants to divorce her. He does not know of her whereabouts and this has delayed starting divorce proceedings. 
Applicant has a girlfriend who he met through work, they live together, and they plan on marriage. The girlfriend provides financial assistance to Applicant and 
this reduces Applicant's living expenses. Applicant earns $14.00 per hour as a security guard and finds his wages do not go very far as he lives in a high-cost 
area. Applicant's current financial situation is fairly described as living paycheck-to-paycheck. He has less than $200.00 in a checking account and no savings 
to speak of.</P> 
<P>Applicant suffers from certain medical conditions requiring prescription drugs. As a result, he has incurred out-of-pocket costs for medical treatments and drugs 
that his health insurance does not cover. </P> 
<P>In an effort to resolve his delinquent indebtedness, Applicant retained the services of a company that provides a debt settlement program to its customers. 
Applicant enrolled in the program in 2004, after receiving the SOR, and has made monthly payments of $210.00 to the company (he is also charged a monthly 
fee of $50.00 for this service). Although Applicant has made several monthly payments to this company, he has not presented documentary proof that any of the 
delinquent debts have been paid, settled, or otherwise resolved through this program.</P> 
<P>Applicant presented favorable character evidence through the testimony of two witnesses and two documentary exhibits (Exhibits A and B). These persons 
believe Applicant is hard working, pays attention to detail, possesses good judgment, is very security conscious, is trustworthy, and is a very dedicated and 
thorough security professional. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline F. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, the delinquent debts, and 
the foreclosure demonstrate a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The same facts and circumstances 
demonstrate financial irresponsibility.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude Applicant receives some credit in mitigation. I am persuaded Applicant's financial 
problems would not be so severe but for his troubled marriage, which is yet to be resolved. Accordingly, MC 3<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> applies in his favor. And Applicant has taken 
the initial steps toward making a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">resolve his indebtedness by enrolling in the debt settlement program.<A HREF="04-06517.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> That credit is limited, however, as there is no documentary proof that any of the debts 
have been resolved via the program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite these matters in mitigation, Applicant's financial problems are long standing and ongoing. Indeed, it appears he is in a deep financial hole with limited 
ability, short of another Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, to resolve his delinquent debts. Until he establishes a long-term track record of good debt management, it is 
simply too soon to tell if he has established a financially responsible lifestyle. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching my decision, I have considered 
the record evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
