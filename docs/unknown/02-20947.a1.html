  There is a rebuttable presumption that government officials carry out their duties properly and in good faith, and a person seeking to rebut or overcome that presumption has the burden of presenting clear evidence to the contrary.  Applicant's speculation about the motives of DOHA personnel falls far short of raising a  colorable claim of improper conduct.  Actions taken pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.27 are outside the scope of the Board's  jurisdiction and authority.  The methods and scope of DSS investigations are outside scope of Board's review.  Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.   Applicant's history of financial difficulties provides a rational basis for the Administrative Judge's unfavorable conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility.  Adverse  decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated September 11, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated March 17, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the pre-hearing investigation and processing of Applicant's case constituted a denial of procedural due 
process; (2) whether the Board should accept post-hearing evidence concerning the funding of Applicant's 401K account and his payment of debts from the account 
proceeds; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge's security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms 
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P>

</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the pre-hearing investigation and processing of Applicant's case constituted a denial of procedural due process</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant makes the following 
assertions: (a) he did not receive the Judge's March 17, 2004 decision until March 27, 2004, resulting in a loss of ten days' time in which to appeal, and possibly 
representing an effort to deny him time to appeal; (b) his security clearance has already been taken from him even though the appeal process is not complete; and (c) 
government investigators failed to provide him the name of a person in authority to whom he could begin to make payments on his outstanding debts and stop the 
investigation.  The Board construes these assertions as a claim that the pre-hearing investigation and processing of Applicant's case constituted a denial of procedural due 
process.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes that Applicant has failed to demonstrate a denial of his procedural rights under the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant states that he did not receive a copy of the Administrative Judge's decision until ten days after it was issued, and asks whether "this was an effort to deny me 
time to appeal?"  Applicant's question fails to raise any colorable claim of error in his case.  First, there is a well-established legal presumption that government officials 
carry out their duties properly and in good faith, and a person seeking to rebut or overcome that presumption has the burden of presenting clear evidence to the contrary.  
<EM>See, e.g., National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish</EM>, 541 U.S. -- , slip op. at 16 (March 30, 2004).  Applicant's speculation about the motives of 
DOHA personnel responsible for mailing Hearing Office decisions to applicants falls far short of raising any colorable claim of improper conduct.  Second, Applicant's 
concern is moot.  Applicant's notice of appeal was submitted in a timely manner, and he suffered no prejudice to his appeal rights.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant complains that his security clearance has already been taken from him even though the appeal process is not complete.  The procedure for the treatment of 
existing security clearances after an adverse decision by an Administrative Judge is governed by the Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.27 (which 
provides for notification of an applicant's employer, through official channels, if a DOHA Hearing Office Administrative Judge issues an adverse security clearance 
decision in the applicant's case).  Actions taken to revoke an applicant's access to classified information after issuance of an adverse decision by a DOHA Administrative 
Judge are taken by DoD personnel outside the scope of the Board's jurisdiction and authority.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0519 (February 23, 2001) at p. 5.  Lacking 
jurisdiction and authority in the matter, the Board cannot comment further.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant complains that, during the period when his case was being investigated, the investigators would not or could not identify for him a person in authority who would 
allow him to start making payments on overdue debt and would stop the investigation.  The methods and scope of DSS investigations are outside the scope of review of 
the Appeal Board.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-32606 (January 21, 2004) at p. 3.  Furthermore, nothing in Executive Order 10865 or the Directive gives an applicant 
a right to have a security investigation stopped or suspended for the applicant's convenience.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Board should accept post-hearing evidence concerning the funding of Applicant's 401K account and his payment of debts from the account proceeds</SPAN>.  
Applicant asserts on appeal that after the hearing, his employer made a sizable contribution to his 401K account and that this contribution would allow Applicant to pay 
off all his debts at once.  Applicant asks the Board to allow him sufficient time to demonstrate that he has paid off his debts, either through the submission of a credit report 
or account receipts.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's assertions concerning his 401K account were not part of the record below.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.29.  Accordingly, the Board cannot consider Applicant's appeal assertions about his 401K account and cannot grant his request to delay 
action on his case to allow him to augment the record before the Board.   </P> 
 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, Applicant asserts the following: (a) there is no reason to believe that his debts are a cause for concern since he has had the debts for many years and he has 
never been a security problem; (b) he has been able to keep his bills current and up to date since returning to work from layoffs; (c) no consideration was given to his 
outstanding record; (d) no consideration was given to his willingness to take a polygraph examination to prove that he was not lying when he filled out his security 
clearance questionnaire; (e) he could have paid his bills earlier on his own but he was afraid he would lose his job anyway and he needed the money for his family; and (f) 
he could have gotten character references from everyone that he works for.  The Board construes these various assertions as an argument that the Administrative Judge's 
decision is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board concludes that Applicant has failed to demonstrate error on the part of the 
Judge.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's argument that his unblemished work record establishes that his debts are no cause for concern is without merit.  The federal government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v</EM>. <EM>United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  Security 
clearance decisions are not an exact science, but rather are predictive judgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present 
circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v</EM>. <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to 
safeguard classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  <EM>Adams v</EM>. <EM>Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 
U.S. 1039 (1970).  Direct or objective evidence of nexus is not required before the government can deny or revoke access to classified information.  <EM>Gayer v. 
Schlesinger</EM>, 490 F.2d 740, 750 (D.C. Cir. 1973).  All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified 
information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  <EM>See</EM>, 
<EM>e</EM>.<EM>g</EM>., ISCR Case No.98-0188 (April 29, 1999) at p. 4.  The record evidence about Applicant's job performance did not preclude the Judge from making an adverse 
decision based on Applicant's history of financial difficulties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 99-0123 (January 11, 2000) at p. 3.</P> 
 
<P>"Under [Guideline] F, the security eligibility of an applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring 
financial difficulties.  Furthermore, [f]inancial difficulties, financial irresponsibility and greed have proven to be significant motivating forces for espionage or attempted 
espionage.  It is clear that the United States must consider whether individuals granted access to classified information are, through financial irresponsibility, greed or 
financial misfortune, in a position where they may be more susceptible to mishandling or compromising classified information or material for financial gain."  ISCR Case 
No. 96-0454 (February 7, 1997) at p. 2 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Given Applicant's overall history of financial problems, including several 
delinquent debts that were still unsatisfied as of the hearing date, the Administrative Judge had a rational basis for his doubts about Applicant's current security eligibility.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant asserts that he was able to maintain timely payments on current accounts after returning to work after a layoff.  This was favorable evidence that the 
Administrative Judge was required to consider, and a reading of the Judge's decision indicates that he did so.  However, Applicant's ability to cite to favorable record 
evidence fails to establish error on the part of the Administrative Judge.  The Judge must consider the record evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable 
evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>, and decide whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0123 (January 11, 2000) at p. 3.  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge did not weigh the record 
evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant complains on appeal that no consideration was given to his twenty-nine-year outstanding record.  He also states that, concerning the issue of his falsification of a 
security clearance questionnaire, no consideration was given to his hearing testimony that he would be willing to take a polygraph exam to establish he was telling the truth.</P> 
 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge has considered all the evidence in a case record.  Furthermore, an Administrative Judge need not discuss 
every single piece of record evidence in his decision.  A review of the Judge's decision in this case reveals that the Judge discussed neither Applicant's work record nor 
his willingness to take a polygraph examination.  These omissions do not constitute error however.  The absence of these items from the decision does not establish that 
the Judge did not consider them.  Additionally, given the totality of the record evidence, the evidence Applicant maintains was not considered is not of sufficient magnitude, 
either in terms of mitigation or refutation of the government's case, to render the Judge's ultimate conclusions arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>In his appeal brief, Applicant states that he could have paid his debts off earlier, but did not do so because he thought he would still lose his job and his family needed the 
money.  He also states that he could have produced character witnesses for the record but did not feel they were necessary.  Neither of these assertions establishes error 
on the part of the Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P>An admission by Applicant that he had the ability to pay his debts off earlier but elected not to do so is not mitigating given the record evidence in this case and does 
nothing to undermine the Judge's ultimate conclusions concerning Applicant's financial history and its effect upon Applicant's security suitability.  Regarding character 
references, Applicant's offer to produce such witnesses does not show the Judge erred.  The hearing was the Applicant's opportunity to produce evidence rebutting, 
explaining, extenuating, or mitigating facts to which he has admitted to or which have been proven by Department Counsel.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.15.  He cannot complain on appeal about foregoing opportunities to present favorable evidence below.</P>
