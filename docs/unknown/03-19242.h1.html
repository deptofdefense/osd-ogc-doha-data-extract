<P>Security concerns were raised regarding a 62-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen-Applicant, born in Taiwan, whose three retired brothers, three sisters, and a 
sister-in-law-remain citizens and residents of Taiwan. Applicant has resided in the U.S. for 35 years. Applicant married his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, in 
1975 in the U.S. Applicant's two children were born and reside in the United States. The security concerns are mitigated by the evidence developed herein. 
Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE </CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>  On January 14, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated<EM> </EM>February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Review Program</EM> dated January 
2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated February 16, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided on the written record, 
in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's File of Relevant Materials (FORM) dated March 21, 2005. Applicant received the FORM 
on April 15, 2005, and was given an opportunity to file objections and submit materials in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant submitted his wife's 
Certificate of Naturalization, and U.S. passport, along with his university transcripts. The case was assigned to me on June 22, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all the factual allegations of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant is 62 years old, and was born and raised in Taiwan (the Republic of China) in 1942. He has been employed in the defense industry since 1987 as an 
engineer. Applicant is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time, in conjunction with his employment.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant is employed as a principal 
engineer/scientist for a large company, and he has worked for this company since 1989. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1983.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant received a bachelor of science degree in 1966 from a Taiwan university. He does not maintain contact with any of his classmates from the university.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN> 
Applicant came to the U.S. in 1970 and took several courses from an American university. He received a masters of science degree in engineering from an 
American university in 1972.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant married his wife, a native-born Taiwan citizen, in 1975 in the U.S. Applicant's wife became a naturalized citizen of the 
U.S. in 1983.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant and his wife have two children who are both native-born U.S. citizens.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant's parents are deceased. His parents-in-law are deceased. Applicant has three brothers and three sisters who are citizens and residents of Taiwan.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> His 
three brothers, in their late 60's to mid 70's, are retired. His sisters are in their 60's and have always been housewives. Applicant's three sisters-in-law, also 
housewives for their entire life, also live in Taiwan.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant's relatives are not political activists.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Within the last 35 years, Applicant traveled to Taiwan three times. He visited in November 2002, June 1994 and March 1976.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN> Each visit lasted approximately 
one and a half weeks and the purpose was to visit family. Applicant does not have any business dealings with the Science Division, Taipei Economic and 
Culture Office Technology.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant remains in touch with a former co-worker from the Division of Taipei Economic and Culture Office. His contact is limited to Christmas and holiday 
greetings. This friend retired from the Taipei Ministry in 2003.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>I have taken official notice of certain facts concerning Taiwan. Taiwan is one of the most active collectors of economic information and Taiwan is one of 
several countries that have significant intelligence operations targeting the U.S.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN> However, Taiwan is an ally of the United States and a significant trading 
partner, with extensive mutual military ties.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive, <EM>Adjudicative Guidelines For Determining Eligibility For Access To Classified Information, </EM>sets forth the criteria which must be 
evaluated when determining security clearance eligibility. The adjudicative guidelines specifically distinguish between those factors that are considered in 
denying or revoking an employee's request for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions), and those factors that are considered in granting an 
employee's request for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions). By acknowledging that individual circumstances of each case are always 
different, the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist an administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
<P>The adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all available, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, to arrive at meritorious decisions. Section E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive describes the essence of scrutinizing all appropriate variables in a 
case as the "whole person concept." In evaluating the conduct of the applicant and the circumstances in any case, the factors an administrative judge should 
consider pursuant to the concept are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>Protecting national security is the paramount concern in reaching a decision in any case, and is dependent upon the primary standard that issuance of a clearance 
must be clearly consistent with the interests of national security. Granting an applicant's clearance for access to classified information is predicated on a high 
degree of trust and confidence in the individual. Accordingly, decisions under the Directive must include consideration of not just the <EM>actual</EM> risk of disclosure 
of such information, but also consideration of any<EM> possible </EM>risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently compromise classified information in any aspect 
of his or her life. Any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting classified 
information.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The decision to deny a security clearance request to an individual is not necessarily a determination of the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> It is merely 
an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines established by the Department of Defense for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>In accordance with the Directive, the government bears the initial burden of proof in the adjudicative process to establish conditions which indicate it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN> When the government meets this burden, a 
heavy burden of persuasion then falls on the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the 
position of the government, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon consideration of all the evidence submitted in this matter, the following adjudicative guideline is appropriate for evaluation with regard to the facts 
of this case: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence: An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen 
of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Guideline B disqualifying and mitigating conditions, raising either raising security concerns or mitigating security concerns applicable to this case, are set 
forth and discussed in the Conclusions sections below. The decision reached in this case is drawn from conclusions I have found to be reasonable, logical and 
based upon the evidence contained in the case record.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline B. Applicant is susceptible to foreign influence because members of his immediate family or persons 
to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation- in this instance, his three brothers and sister-in-law are citizens and residents of Taiwan. These 
situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information. However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline 
B. Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a susceptibility to foreign influence depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts 
and circumstances of those family ties.<A HREF="03-19242.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant has strong personal and professional ties to the United States.</P> 
<P>Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.1. (<EM>An immediate family member or person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or 
obligation, is a</EM> <EM>citizen, or</EM>, <EM>a resident or present in, a foreign country), </EM>applies because Applicant has immediate family members (his three brothers and three 
sisters) who are citizens of and residents in Taiwan. He visited his family three times in 35 years. There is no record of any other communications. Although 
Applicant has a blood relationship, three visits in 35 years does not constitute a close family tie. There is nothing in the record to suggest any other 
communications with his brothers, sisters, and sister-in-law. I find that in this case there are no strong ties of affection or obligation. His three bothers are 
retired and there is nothing in the record to suggest that Appellant supports them or is obligated to them. The remaining FI DCs do not apply.<EM></EM></P> 
<P>I reviewed the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) under Guideline B and conclude that FI MC  E2.A2.1.3.1. applies. (<EM>A determination that the 
immediate family member(s), spouse, father, mothers, sons, daughter, brothers, sisters), cohabitant or associates(s) in question are not agents of a foreign 
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person (s) involved and the 
United States)</EM>. Applicant's immediate family members are retired and his sisters are and have been housewives. His brothers and sisters and sister-in-law are in 
their 60's to 70's. Applicant asserts that none of them are political activists. This assertion has not been rebutted by the government. There is no evidence in the 
record that any of the Applicant's relatives has the power or the means to leave the country at will. Under these circumstances, the opportunity for adverse 
influence against these relatives in Taiwan is <EM>de minimus</EM>. Applicant's other family members live in the U.S. Given these circumstances, his immediate family 
members are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power. His closest family members are his wife, who is a naturalized citizen, and children, who are 
U.S. born. They live in the U.S. with him, thus, negating any vulnerability from pressure or duress being applied to these family members. Second, FI MC 
E2.A2.1.3.3. (<EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent),</EM> applies to Applicant's former co-worker who receives a Christmas 
card each year. This is infrequent and casual<EM>.</EM></P> 
<P>I have considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I am persuaded by the totality 
of the evidence in this case, that Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or duress from a foreign power or government of Taiwan. Applicant has lived in the 
U.S. since 1970, and has been a law-abiding U.S. citizen since 1983. He has earned a master's degree in the U.S. and has worked in his field of expertise in the 
U.S. His employment in the defense industry has been with one company for many years. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen and his children are native-born 
U.S. citizens. Applicant considers the U.S. as his home. Applicant has made only three trips to Taiwan in 35 years. The record is silent as to any other 
communications with his family.</P> 
<P>Applicant has met his burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him and his burden of 
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching my decision, I have considered the record evidence as a whole, the whole person concept, the 
clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive. Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in 
favor of Applicant.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P> 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline B:   FOR THE APPLICANT</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a:    For the Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b:    For the Applicant</P> 
<P>Subparagraph 1.c:    For the Applicant</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. Clearance is granted<STRONG>.</STRONG></P>
