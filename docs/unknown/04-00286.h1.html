</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 16, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
a security clearance for Applicant.  In response, by letter of August 12, 2004, Applicant admitted to the four allegations contained in the SOR and requested an 
administrative determination based on the submissions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case was submitted on February 9, 2005, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> was provided to Applicant.  
Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant signed for a copy of the 
FORM on March 6, 2005, and chose not to submit any additional materials.  I was assigned this case on May 11, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has admitted to the four allegations set forth in the SOR.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 49-year-old male who has been employed by a defense contractor since October 2001.  Born, raised, and educated in Pakistan, he married a 
fellow Pakistan native in 1989 and the couple had their first child in 1990.  Seeking a better future, they emigrated to the United States in 1991.  Having found 
no employment and with his wife in ill health, they returned to Pakistan a year later.  The family again emigrated to the United States in 1994.  This time, 
Applicant found a job as a machine operator and the family remained in the United States.  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1999; his wife and 
eldest daughter are also naturalized U.S. citizens.  The couple's youngest children, born in the U.S., are citizens by birth.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Since 1994, Applicant has returned to 
Pakistan twice: for a 1996 wedding and a 2002 pleasure trip. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Remaining behind in Pakistan as citizens and residents are Applicant's mother and five brothers.  His mother is 69 years old.  Although he no longer has any 
real connection to her current  activities, he does call once in a while to inquire about her health.  Her support and care is provided by his brothers in Pakistan, 
who take turns having her stay with them.  The one exception to this rotation of maternal care is a brother who is employed by a branch of the Pakistan military.  
Neither Applicant's mother nor his brothers maintain contact with this sibling.  Indeed, owing to a family dispute, Applicant has not had any contact with this 
brother in over a decade.  Further, he has no idea where this brother lives, knows nothing of his brother's family, and does not know the nature of his work.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A second brother is a civil servant, working in a white collar capacity on the staff of a Pakistani government official.  Applicant does not know anything about 
his brother's work, nor have they discussed his work.  None of his remaining three brothers are associated with a military, paramilitary, governmental, or non-governmental organization.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's motivation in emigrating to this country was his need for new challenges and opportunities.  He loves the United States and holds it above his 
family back in Pakistan.  He has built a comfortable life in the U.S. and he has high hopes for his children. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> He has no intention to return to his life in Pakistan 
because he feels that the U.S. is a better place to raise his family.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person"</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, it should be noted that Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN>. </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG><A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits that his mother and five brothers are citizens and 
residents of a foreign country, specifically, Pakistan.  The citizenship and current residency of these six immediate family members raises a security concern 
with regard to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>]<EM>n immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close 
tiers of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's mother and three of her sons have no apparent relationship with the Pakistan government, two brothers do.  One brother may be 
discounted because even though he serves with a branch of the Pakistan military, Applicant has demonstrated that he and the rest of his family are purposefully 
estranged from this sibling. More problematic is a second brother who currently serves a government official and is a member of the civil service.  Based on 
this limited information, a finding cannot be made that this sibling is not necessarily an agent of a foreign power.  Consequentially, Foreign Influence 
itigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 ([<EM>a</EM>] <EM>determination that the family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sons), cohabitant, 
or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to 
choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the Untied States</EM>) does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Contact with Applicant's military sibling has already been noted.  Applicant has had no contact with this brother for over a decade and his family is equally 
estranged from this person it considers to be <EM>persona non grata</EM>.  Under these circumstances, mitigation has been established with regard to this sibling pursuant 
to FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 ([<EM>c</EM>]<EM>ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent</EM>). Therefore, I find in Applicant's favor with regard to 
subparagraph 1.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same mitigation, however, cannot be found with regard to the rest of the family.  Applicant concedes that he has visited Pakistan twice over the past 
decade, including one trip specifically made to attend a family wedding.  Moreover, although he characterizes his contact with his mother as being otherwise 
limited to telephone calls placed "once in a while" to ask about her health, such concerns are understandably not casual.  Furthermore, based on the fact that his 
mother is rotated among the homes of his siblings, it is logical to assume that these calls also foster contact with his brothers and their families.<A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant, 
however, has failed to describe or demonstrate the extent, frequency, and nature of such fraternal contact.  Having failed to further expound upon these 
relationships so as to permit a clear basis upon which to assess their contact, I cannot find that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 applies to his mother or his remaining four 
siblings.  Additionally, I find subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d of the SOR for the Government.  No other mitigating conditions are applicable. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also relevant is the country at issue.  Although Pakistan is aiding the United States. in its fight against international terrorism, it remains a dangerous place.  
Sectarian and separatist terrorists within Pakistan continue to target American citizens, not just at official U.S. facilities, but also at more vulnerable targets, 
such as hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, and outdoor event venues.<A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Bombings, assassinations, and kidnaping continue to occur throughout 
the country.<A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Western interests are similarly targeted.<A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The fact that his mother and siblings are Pakistani citizens and residents place Applicant in a position of 
vulnerability to be influenced by coercive or noncoercive means; this vulnerability is compounded by the fact that one brother is a civil servant and works 
directly for a political figure.  In such cases, and without more persuasive argument from the Applicant, this vulnerability is sufficient to deny a security 
clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the record evidence and considered the Applicant using the "whole person" concept.  I am particularly struck by Applicant's dedication to this 
country and his hopes for his children.  Although there is no basis in the record </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to question Applicant's character and integrity, the DOHA Appeal Board has 
recognized that "a finding that an applicant possesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government from considering whether the applicant's 
facts and circumstances still pose a security risk."<A HREF="04-00286.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  By failing to more fully address or explain his familial relationships and the extent and frequency of his 
contact with his family in Pakistan in a such a way as to mitigate concerns, Applicant has failed to carry his burden and assuage the doubts they raise.  Further, 
inasmuch as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">any doubts must be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant, I find against Applicant with regard to the allegation set forth at 
paragraph 1 of the SOR.</SPAN></P>
