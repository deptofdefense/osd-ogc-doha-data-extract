<P>Applicant has had a history of financial difficulties, including a bankruptcy. A significant cause of Applicant's past financial difficulties was her former 
marriage to her ex-husband, who did not pay the family bills. Applicant did not discover the extant of her past financial difficulties until after her divorce.  Most 
of her past overdue debts have now  been paid, and she is working to resolve the rest. Appellant has consulted with a financial advisor and has a more stable 
and mature outlook about her finances. Mitigation has been established.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Clearance is granted.</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 9, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated February 21, 2003, Applicant responded in writing to the SOR allegations.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She requested a clearance decision based on a 
hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 23, 2003, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on May 6, 2003, because of caseload consideration, the case was reassigned to 
me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on May 6, 2003, and the hearing was held on May 20, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits 1 through 6), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered five 
documentary exhibits (Applicant Exhibits A through E) and offered her own testimony.  After the hearing, the record was left open, and Applicant offered 
additional documentary exhibits, none of which were objected to by Department Counsel. Four letters of reference were marked as Exhibits F. An updated 
financial statement was marked as Exhibits G. A letter regarding creditor 1 was marked as Exhibits H.  A letter regarding creditor 3 was marked as Exhibits I. A 
letter regarding creditor 4 was marked as Exhibits J. A Moneygram  regarding creditor 5 was marked as Exhibits K. Applicant Exhibits F through K have been 
entered into evidence. The transcript (TR) was received on June 2, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. The SOR 
contains 10 allegations, 1.a. through 1.j., under</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F</SPAN>. T<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">here are</SPAN> seven debts in the SOR that Applicant owed as of June 5, 2002, 1.a. to 1.g. In her 
response to the SOR, Applicant admits that these debts were owed, but responded that some of them have now been paid. These debts are incorporated as 
findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional Findings of Fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 41 year old employee of a defense contractor who seeks access to classified information.</SPAN> She is divorced and has no children.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence establishes that Applicant (1) was indebted in the amounts alleged, and (2) all of the debts were delinquent as of June 2002.</SPAN> The total of these 
seven debts owed by Applicant was approximately $8,620. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debts will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the SOR:      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This debt to Creditor 1</SPAN> is in the amount of $485. Applicant testified that she has arranged a payment plan, and she will pay $100 a month. At the time of the 
hearing Applicant had paid $100 in April 2003, and was planning to continue making payments every month until the debt is paid in full. (TR at 40-42.) </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This debt to Creditor 2</SPAN> is in the amount of $204. Applicant testified that she has paid this debt in full as of February 2003. (TR at 30)  Exhibits A and H 
establish that Applicant has paid  this debt in full.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This debt to Creditor 3</SPAN> is in the amount of $292. Applicant testified that she has paid this debt in ful as of February 2003. (TR at 30-32.) Exhibits B and I 
establish that Applicant has paid  this debt in full.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This debt to Creditor 4</SPAN> is in the amount of $160. Applicant testified that she has paid this debt in full as of February 2003. (TR at 33-35.) Exhibit C establishes 
that Applicant has paid  this debt in full. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This debt to Creditor 5</SPAN> is in the amount of $2,468. Applicant testified that she has reached a compromise to resolve this debt by paying $1,085, and she has 
arranged a payment plan where she will pay two monthly payments of $542.50. (TR at 36-37, Exhibit D.) Applicant made the first payment of this debt on May 
2003, and she was scheduled to resolve this debt completely in June 2003. (Exhibit K.)</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This debt to Creditor 6</SPAN> is in the amount of $4,906. Applicant has made several telephone calls to this creditor, but she has been informed that the creditor has 
been unable to locate the records of this debt. Therefore, Applicant has not been able to resolve this debt, despite making a good faith effort.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This debt to Creditor 7</SPAN> is in the amount of $105. Applicant paid this debt in July 2002. (TR at 46, Attachment to Applicant's answer to the SOR.) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant wrote a check to a convenience store in the amount of $15, which was returned for insufficient funds. When Applicant wrote the check in question, 
she was unaware that her bank had not yet credited her account with a check that she had deposited into that account. Ultimately Applicant paid $50 to the 
court, and the charge of writing a check with insufficient funds was dismissed. (TR at 37-40, Exhibit E.) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted an updated financial statement, which showed that her financial situation has improved significantly. As a result of greater earnings and 
fewer expenses her current monthly net remainder is approximately $670. (Exhibit G.)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's finances became problematic largely as a result of her marriage from 1986 to 1991, during which time her husband did not pay a number of the 
family bills, including the mortgage for the family home. Applicant was not aware of the seriousness of her financial difficulties until after she was divorced.  
When she initially filed for bankruptcy she attempted to keep her home by filing a Chapter 13, but she was advised that, based on her financial situation, it was 
necessary to convert the bankruptcy to Chapter 7. The bankruptcy was finalized, and her debts were discharged on April, 1995. (TR at 47-51, Exhibit 3.)</P> 
 
<P>In an attempt to resolve her finances, she has also consulted with a financial advisor. Finally, Applicant introduced four very positive letters of reference on her 
behalf. ( Exhibit F.)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the 
overall common sense determination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 
2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3 Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's<STRONG> </STRONG>control (e.g., loss of employment, a business<EM> </EM>downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.4. The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>           </STRONG>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of 
persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. 
Assessment of Applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency 
and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to Guideline F:</SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established that </SPAN>Applicant has a history of financial difficulties, including a bankruptcy. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically 
exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case involves the former. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, individuals who are financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. </SPAN>However,  the majority of 
Applicant's past overdue debts have been resolved, and she has been making a concerted effort to resolve her remaining overdue debts. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>I, therefore,  resolve 
Guideline F for Applicant.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Disqualifying Conditions (DC), I conclude both DC E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 apply, because of Applicant's history of not meeting financial 
obligations and her inability to satisfy her debts. However, I find Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.3 applies because </SPAN>a significant amount of Appellant's 
past financial difficulties<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> occurred because her ex-husband failed to make the required payments for their home and other family expenses. This was unknown 
to Applicant until after her divorce from her husband and largely beyond Applicant's<STRONG> </STRONG>control.  Additionally, MC E2.A6.1.3.4 applies because </SPAN>Applicant has 
consulted with a financial advisor and has a more stable and mature outlook about her finances, and is now making a consistent effort to be current on all of her 
debts.</P>
