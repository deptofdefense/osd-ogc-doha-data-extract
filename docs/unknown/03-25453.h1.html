<P>Applicant whose initial financial delinquencies were discharged in bankruptcy in June 1998, permitted his finances to deteriorate to the point where his 
accounts became delinquent and either sent to collection or charged off.  With mounting financial pressures, he did nothing with 95% of his accounts until the 
trustworthiness review commenced.  In 2003, in reply to a question regarding delinquent accounts, he lied and denied having any accounts 180 days delinquent. 
Questions and doubts remain as to his eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position designated ADP-II.  Eligibility is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of Defense Regulation 5200.2-R., <EM>Personnel Security Program,</EM> dated January 1987, 
as amended and modified (the Regulation); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>, dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive); and a memorandum from the Deputy Director for Personnel Security, Office of the Assistant Secretary 
of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (C<SUP>3</SUP>I), dated August 4, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue Applicant's eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position designated ADP-II to support a contract with the Department of 
Defense, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written answer, dated July 19, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to 
me on October 15, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued that same date scheduling the hearing for November 17, 2004.  The hearing was held as scheduled.  
During the hearing, 8 government exhibits, and 13 Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant), were received.  The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on November 29, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the commencement of the hearing, the Department Counsel conceded Applicant had mitigated the following factual allegations pertaining to financial 
matters under Guideline F in the SOR: subparagraphs 1.d., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., and 1.u.; as well as the following factual allegations pertaining to 
personal conduct under Guideline E in the SOR: subparagraph 2.a. as it referred to subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b.,  1.c., 1.d., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.p., 1.s., 
1.t., and 1.w., and urged me to find those allegations in favor of the Applicant.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  In light of that concession, I ruled the allegations had been successfully 
mitigated and advised Applicant he was under no further obligation to address them.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted several of the factual allegations pertaining to financial matters under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.e., 1.g., 1.i., 1.j., 1.q., 1.r., 1.v., and 
1.w.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  He denied the remaining factual allegations under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a. through 
1.d., 1.f., 1.h., 1.k. through 1.p., 1.s. through 1.u., and 1.x.), as well as personal conduct under Guideline E (subparagraph 2.a.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to be granted eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position designated ADP-II.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's finances were generally in good order until the mid-1990s.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  While attending college he had a series of lower-paying jobs that provided income 
sufficient to live on but nothing to save.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He and the woman he later married in January 1992<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> moved to another state in early 1991,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> about the time he accepted 
a job as a driver.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Shortly after their relocation, Applicant's wife was arrested for previous welfare fraud and extradited back to the state where they originally 
resided.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He had to raise $3,000.00 to bail her out of jail.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The family relocated back to where they left, without jobs,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and money had to be shifted around 
from intended creditors.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Accounts became delinquent.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Applicant obtained a job about four weeks after relocating,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and his wife had one waiting for her 
upon her release from jail.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  After working his way through several lower-paying jobs such as truck driver, warehouse worker, pizza deliveryman, etc.,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> as well 
as several periods of unemployment,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> he decided to return to school to earn his degree and qualify for a higher-paying job<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> with a career and a future.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Still burdened with financial delinquencies, Applicant and his wife initially sought the assistance of a credit counseling service.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  When they realized they were 
not in a position to successfully address those delinquencies, they sought the assistance of an attorney.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  They filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13 in June 1996,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> listing assets of $21,675.00 and liabilities of $68,502.00.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Because of difficulties with one creditor who demanded a much higher 
monthly payment than Applicant could afford, the bankruptcy action was dismissed in January 1997.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  Two months later, in March 1997, they filed another 
voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> listing assets of $23,225.00 and liabilities of $46,754.00.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  That bankruptcy action was, likewise, 
dismissed in May 1998.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1998, Applicant filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> listing assets of $12,700.00 and liabilities of $33,320.25.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  There were approximately 80 
creditors identified as holding unsecured nonpriority claims,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> involving charge accounts, medical service, magazine subscriptions, fitness center expenses, 
video rentals, automobiles, rent, loans, food, photographs, beauty supplies, utility service, and a number of bounced checks.  At the time of the petition, 
Applicant' wife was the sole wage earner and Applicant was a full-time student.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  They were released from all dischargeable debts in June 1998.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  
Nevertheless, after the bankruptcy discharge, his financial situation was "shaky for a time."<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant's initial financial burden was resolved in bankruptcy, he has had a succession of better-paying positions.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  His annual salary in 1999 was 
approximately $30,000.00,<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> and it is currently $82,000.00.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  Unfortunately, despite the discharge of his debts in 1998, and the substantial increase in salary, 
Applicant continues to have significant financial delinquencies which he attributes to one of his employers going out of business unexpectedly, medical, dental, 
and orthodontic bills, multiple automobile purchases, and a home purchase, as well as "not being responsible."<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  He encountered another automobile 
repossession shortly after he purchased a new residence in 2002-03.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2003, Applicant began to reassess his financial situation and vowed to repair his credit.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  He claimed it was his goal for 2003 to pay off all of his bills, 
including his back taxes to the Internal Revenue Service and two personal loans.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A>  At that time he had a total net monthly income of $5,740.54 (including his 
wife's salary), monthly expenses of $2,150.00, monthly household debt payments of $3,181.00, and a monthly net remainder available for discretionary 
spending of $409.54.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  In November 2004, Applicant had revolving accounts with five creditors totaling $25,243.80 and eight collection accounts totaling 
$1,157.00.<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR originally identified 21 delinquent accounts which had either been sent to collection or charged off long after other delinquent accounts had been 
discharged in bankruptcy.  However, in light of the concessions made by the Department Counsel regarding a number of those accounts, the government now 
contends there are only 12 delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,310.00.  Those accounts, and their current status, are described below:</SPAN></P>

remaining account was mitigated to the satisfaction of the government).  Under Applicant's proposed payment schedule, he would give priority to accounts that

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability (as well as trustworthiness 
eligibility).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in 
deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position 
(Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access to classified information or 
eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security or trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security or trustworthiness 
concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security (and sensitive information) is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by 
applying the standard the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="03-25453.h1.html#N_106_"><SUP> (106)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national 
interest." For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information or eligibility for occupying 
an Information Systems Position.  If the government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in 
refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance or eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified or sensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  
It is a relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government 
must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information or eligibility for occupying 
an Information Systems Position.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified or sensitive information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions (and by inference, trustworthiness decisions) shall be "in terms of the national interest and 
shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance and trustworthiness decisions cover many characteristics of 
an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and 
conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline F.  From the mid-1990s through the present, Applicant's finances have been in total disarray.  The 
expenses of relocation, the expenses associated with his wife's arrest for welfare fraud, brief periods of unemployment and under employment, and the results 
of living in a one-wage earner family while he attended school, as well as the normal expenses of life, resulted in a situation where he was no longer able to 
remain current with his bills and they became delinquent.  In March 1998, Applicant had liabilities of $33,320.25 and assets of only $12,700.00.  He had 
approximately 80 creditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims, involving charge accounts, medical service, magazine subscriptions, fitness center expenses, 
video rentals, automobiles, rent, loans, food, photographs, beauty supplies, utility service, and a number of bounced checks.  But in June 1998, he was released 
from all dischargeable debts and given new opportunities to start over again unburdened by financial delinquencies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Unfortunately, Applicant failed to take advantage of his new opportunities and his financial situation soon spiraled downward once again.  His increased 
income was accompanied by greater expenses and his "not being responsible."  He chose to ignore most of his debts until at least 2003, and slowly came to the 
realization that his financial situation needed to be repaired.  Although it was his stated goal to pay off all of his bills in 2003, he failed to do so.  In mid-2004, 
Applicant finally took the first steps towards addressing some of his delinquent accounts, but, for the most part, was largely unmotivated until he received the 
SOR in this case.  As noted above, he did nothing with 95% of his accounts until the trustworthiness review commenced.  Applicant's actions in failing to 
satisfy most of his debts until he received the SOR in 2004, or his remaining longstanding outstanding financial obligations thereafter, gives rise to Financial 
Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In considering the evidence, I do not believe that Applicant's financial situation and difficulties bring this matter within Financial Considerations Mitigating 
Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>), FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>), and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual initiated a good-faith 
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  As noted above, after he was released from all dischargeable debts in June 1998, those conditions 
referred to in FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. which might have applied to him before that time no longer applied.  Likewise, the significance of his actions in finally 
seeking counseling from a consumer counseling service in mid-October 2004 is minimized because, as of the date of the hearing in mid-November 2004, 
Applicant had still not completed all the necessary paperwork. Furthermore, there are no clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  
Instead, there is substantial evidence Applicant's motivation is induced by this security clearance review, his future actions in addressing his financial 
delinquencies are speculative at best, and there has been no demonstrative change in his financial habits.  In light of the combined family income and the length 
of the financial delinquencies, I do not consider Applicant's recently completed or promised future efforts to repay his overdue creditors to constitute "good 
faith efforts" sufficient to raise FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6.  Under these circumstances, Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case, for the 
evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. 
through 1.c., 1.e. through 1.g., 1.j., 1.m., 1.q. through 1.t., and 1.v. through 1.x., of the SOR are concluded against Applicant.  In light of the concession by 
Department Counsel, allegations 1.d., 1.h., 1.i., 1.k., 1.l., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., and 1.u., of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline E</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  Examination of Applicant's actions reveals conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, and unreliability in omitting and concealing the true nature of his financial disarray.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">His</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> actions in February 2003 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fall within Personal 
Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any

dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's eventual acknowledgment regarding his history of financial delinquency, only when confronted by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
investigator in April 2003, does not lessen or minimize, much less erase or nullify, the impact of his initial falsification, omission, and deception. That eventual 
admission was insufficient to activate Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct 
the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's position regarding his financial delinquencies as of February 2003 is not credible. In light of all of his delinquent accounts at that time, it is simply 
unreasonable to accept his contention that he was unaware of those accounts which were 180 days delinquent.  At that time, in addition to numerous other 
delinquent accounts, he also had delinquent accounts with the U.S. Department of Education alone totaling over $16,000.00, and he claims the $924.00 
payments on his HUD-1 took care of those delinquencies.  In this case, I believe the true measure of Applicant's candor is his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">admission that he did nothing 
with 95% of his accounts until the trustworthiness review commenced</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  The evidence supports a conclusion Applicant intended to conceal his financial 
delinquencies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">eligibility to occupy an Information Systems Position </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">is essential to make an accurate, meaningful 
trustworthiness determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, an eligibility decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security.  
The nature of Applicant's actions and activities therefore pose a serious potential risk to the nation's security precautions which go to the very heart of the 
nation's security system.  An applicant's responsibilities associated with the granting of an  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">eligibility to occupy an Information Systems Position </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">are 
considerable in terms of protecting the national security and in maintaining appropriate personal conduct.  Along with the responsibilities is accountability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 
this instance, Applicant is now held accountable for those past actions and activities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I do not take this position lightly.  Based on the law, as set forth in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, and my 
application of the pertinent factors and conditions under the Adjudicative Process, I believe Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case.  
The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's continued trustworthiness eligibility and suitability.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Accordingly, allegation 2.a. of 
the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible to occupy an Information Systems Position designated ADP-II to support a contract with the
