<P>Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised under foreign preference by demonstrating that she did not consider herself a dual citizen of Jamaica, that she became subject to administrative 
revocation of her Jamaican citizenship under Jamaican law when she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 1997, she had surrendered her Jamaican passport to the Jamaican Embassy in May 
2006, and was willing to renounce her Jamaican citizenship. She mitigated the security concerns raised under foreign influence by demonstrating that her father--a U.S. citizen residing in 
Jamaica--was not an agent of a foreign government or so situated as to provide a point of influence on Applicant. Clearance granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant challenges the 18 January 2006 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of her clearance because of foreign 
preference, foreign influence, and personal conduct.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 8 February 2006 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 2 May 2006 and I convened a 
hearing on 10 August 2006. DOHA received the transcript 23 August 2006.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations under Guidelines C and B. She denied intending to falsify her clearance application under Guideline E. I incorporate her admission as  findings of fact. She 
is a 33-year-old information systems engineer employed by a  defense contractor since January 2001. She has not previously held a clearance, but was granted access to public trust information in 
non-DoD agencies in 2001.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Jamaica in December 1973. She initially came to the U.S. in 1976 with her parents, because her mother had a position at the Jamaican embassy in public relations/marketing. 
Applicant attended elementary school in the U.S. from kindergarten through fourth grade. Around 1980, when she was about seven (2<SUP>nd</SUP> or 3<SUP>rd</SUP> grade), her parents separated and ultimately divorced. 
Her father remained in the U.S. Applicant returned to Jamaica with her mother, and attended fifth and sixth grade in Jamaica.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After sixth grade, Applicant's mother got another job in the U.S., and Applicant returned to the U.S. with her. She finished middle school and high school in the U.S, and obtained both her 
bachelor's and master's degrees from U.S. colleges. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 1997. While in college, she met a man she later married in August 2001. They both work at the 
same company, although not on the same projects. He has had a clearance since before 1997. They own property in two states, have a two-year old son born in the U.S., and maintain retirement and 
other accounts in the U.S. Applicant has no financial interests in Jamaica.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother is a citizen of Jamaica, residing in the U.S. as a legal permanent resident. Her two brothers are naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S. Her father is also a U.S. citizen, but 
he now lives in Jamaica.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant applied for her clearance in November 2003 (G.E. 1), she disclosed her foreign birth, foreign relatives, and her foreign travel (10 trips between 1997 and 2003, seven of them to 
Jamaica).<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> She did not disclose that she possessed a Jamaican passport valid until September 2006. She also did not disclose that her godfather--a long-time family friend known as "uncle" in 
keeping with Jamaican culture--had been prime minister of Jamaica since March 1992.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified credibly that she failed to disclose her possession of the passport both because she thought the passport was no longer valid and because she misread the passport question to look 
back five years instead of seven (Tr. 66). However, she disclosed her possession of the Jamaican passport--as well as the fact that she used it to enter Jamaica in June 1998--during a subject 
interview in March 2005. She also testified credibly that she did not think to disclose her godfather on her clearance application as contact with a foreign government because she has never had any 
contact with him in his official capacity as prime minister of Jamaica, and thinks of him only as her godfather. He retired as prime minister of Jamaica in March 2006.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant first came to the U.S. in 1976, and when she returned to the U.S. after sixth grade, she did so using a Jamaican passport. Under U.S. immigration law, she was required to maintain 
a current passport from her country of citizenship. When she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 1997, she possessed a Jamaican passport valid until September 2006. In fact, she used that 
passport to travel to Jamaica in June 1997 before she was naturalized. She has credibly stated that she retained the passport only because she did not know what else to do with it, no one asked her 
to surrender it, and she was not aware of any negative ramifications associated with holding on to it, as she had not had any employment contact with the government (Tr. 63). However, she did use 
it once to enter Jamaica once in July 1998, after she became a U.S. citizen. She was vaguely aware at the time that she could have traveled to Jamaica with her naturalization certificate, but used  her 
Jamaican passport out of habit and convenience, and to skirt the much longer "foreign arrivals" line at immigration (Tr. 63). Nevertheless, she thinks she may have used her naturalization certificate 
to re-enter the U.S. after that trip. She never used her Jamaican passport after the 1998 trip. She obtained her U.S. passport in May 2000, and has used only that passport for her foreign travel since.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father resides in Jamaica and works as a retail store manager. Applicant has not had very frequent contact with him since her parents separated, but does talk to him by telephone a 
couple of times per year, and has personal contact with him once every few trips to Jamaica. Applicant and her husband usually stay in the tourist areas in Jamaica, and her father comes to visit them 
there. However, on occasion, she and her husband have driven to his home to see him. In similar fashion, her contacts with her godfather have been very infrequent. He has sometimes visited 
Applicant and her husband when they have vacationed in Jamaica. Sometimes he visits them when he has speaking engagements in the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character references--her company supervisor and a co-worker--consider her a reliable and trustworthy person. She has an excellent work record and her employer recommends her for 
a clearance. She has adequately safeguarded company proprietary information and the sensitive information she has had access to on her non-DoD contracts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Jamaican law, Applicant did not lose her Jamaican citizenship automatically when she became a naturalized U.S. citizen. However, Jamaican law provides that the Governor General of 
Jamaica may, by order, deprive Applicant of her citizenship because she became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Jamaican law also provides for renunciation of citizenship, but the process is both 
convoluted and expensive. Applicant has expressed a willingness to renounce her Jamaican citizenship, but has not formally done so because of the expense. She considers herself only a citizen of 
the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Jamaica is a developing nation with a poor human rights record. However, it is not known to be a collector of intelligence or economic information against the U.S. The internet link to the Jamaican 
Embassy embedded in the U.S. State Department on-line Background Note on Jamaica leads to a web page that contains only tourist information [Appellate Exhibit (App.Ex.) 1]. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The United States 
maintains close and productive relations with the Government of Jamaica. The United States is Jamaica's most important trading partner. Jamaica is a popular destination for American tourists; 
more than 800,000 Americans visited in 2000. In addition, some 10,000 American citizens, including many dual-nationals born on the island, permanently reside in Jamaica. [Background 
Note-Jamaica, March 2006 (Official Notice document 2)]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense 
consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. 
Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline 
E (Personal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less 
than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" 
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline C case by demonstrating that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Jamaica by possessing and using her Jamaican 
passport in July 1998--after she became a naturalized U.S. citizen.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> However, several mitigating factors apply. Applicant acquired her Jamaican citizenship only because she was born there.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She 
left Jamaica when she was three and, except for two years in Jamaican elementary school, her cultural experience has been growing up in the U.S.  In accordance with U.S. law, she maintained her 
Jamaican passport until she became a U.S. citizen, and although she used it once under circumstances where she had no reason to know of any potential adverse consequences for using it,  she 
surrendered it once she became aware of the consequences of retaining it for any purpose. Although she did not lose her Jamaican citizenship as a matter of law when she became a U.S. citizen, she 
is subject to administrative revocation of her Jamaican citizen ship because she became a U.S. citizen. Further, she considers herself only a citizen of the U.S., and has stated a willingness to 
renounce her Jamaican citizenship.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  I resolve Guideline C for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B by demonstrating that Applicant's father resides in Jamaica and her godfather (not a member of her immediate family) was 
formerly prime minister of Jamaica.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  However, Applicant has met the relevant mitigating conditions under foreign influence. Her father is not an agent of a foreign government involved in any 
collection activity, and is not so situated as to provide a point of influence on Applicant, thus satisfying Mitigating Condition (MC) 1.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> In particular, Jamaica does not collect U.S. economic or 
intelligence information, and there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Jamaica poses any threat to U.S. interests. Further, her contacts with her father and her godfather are casual and 
infrequent<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and she has reported her foreign contacts as required.<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> While her contacts with her godfather were not the result of her being on official government business,<A HREF="05-11864.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> they were also not 
contacts with her godfather in his capacity as prime minister of Jamaica, but only as her godfather and family friend. I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government did not establish a Guideline E case, as Applicant lacked the requisite intent to mislead the government. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
