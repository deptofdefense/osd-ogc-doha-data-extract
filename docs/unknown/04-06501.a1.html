<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 6, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
(SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), pursuant to Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 27, 2005, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Shari 
Dam denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.<A HREF="04-06501.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred in making an adverse finding under SOR paragraph 1.b.; whether the 
Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred in making an adverse finding under SOR paragraph 1.b, because the finding is contrary to the record 
evidence and the Judge's own finding of fact.  The Board finds Applicant's argument persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge found that the brother referred to in SOR paragraph 1.b had died in November 2004 at the age of 74.  Decision at 4.  Because that 
brother is deceased, he no longer presents any security concern for the Applicant.  Accordingly, the Applicant has established error, but the error is harmless 
because it would not change the outcome of the case.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant also argues that the Administrative Judge's decision should be reversed because her application of Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="04-06501.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 3,<A HREF="04-06501.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
and the whole  person factors<A HREF="04-06501.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> is not sustainable.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive. </P> 
 
<P>Given the record in this case, the Administrative Judge's application of Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3 was sustainable.  Moreover, the Judge made 
extensive findings of fact which indicate that she evaluated the totality of Applicant's circumstances in reaching her decision.  The Judge weighed the 
mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the security concerns presented by Applicant's circumstances and reasonably explained why 
that evidence was insufficient to overcome those concerns.  Therefore, the Judge's whole person analysis is also sustainable.</P>
