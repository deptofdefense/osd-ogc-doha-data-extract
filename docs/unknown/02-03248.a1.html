  The Board need not address claims of error that are not material.  As a general proposition, an applicant is collaterally estopped from denying he or she engaged in conduct that underlies a felony conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is based on a guilty plea or not.  The Board need not decide  whether Applicant's case falls under a possible exception to the general rule concerning collateral estoppel.  Even assuming, solely for purposes of deciding this  appeal, that Applicant was not collaterally estopped from contending he is innocent of the criminal conduct for which he was convicted, there is sufficient  record evidence to support the Judge's finding that Applicant engaged in sexual misconduct with his minor daughter.  The Judge's findings about Applicant's  sexual misconduct provide a rational basis for his unfavorable security clearance decision even though there is no evidence that Applicant committed any  security violation.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated February 27, 2004, which stated the reasons 
why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct), and Guideline D (Sexual Behavior).  Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated 
December 9, 2004.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary 
to law because it is based on factual errors; and (2) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary 
to law because the Judge did not cite any complaints against Applicant for mishandling classified information and Applicant's conviction did not lead to his 
mishandling of classified information.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because it is based on factual errors</SPAN>.  
Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision was predicated on several factual findings that Applicant contends were 
erroneous.  Some of the alleged erroneous findings were related to the disqualifying conduct under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and D (Sexual Behavior), 
while others were more related to Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </P> 
<P>The first two claimed factual errors (pertaining to the status and disposition of Applicant's motion to vacate his criminal conviction) are not material to whether 
Applicant engaged in sexual misconduct with his minor daughter in 2001.  The Board need not address claims of error that are not material.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.</P> 
<P>There is no merit to Applicant's third claimed factual error (that the Administrative Judge implicitly found Applicant pleaded guilty to the criminal charge for 
which he was convicted).  The Judge did not find or imply that Applicant pleaded guilty to the criminal charge.  The Judge specifically found that Applicant 
was convicted of one count of aggravated criminal sexual abuse of his minor daughter, on the basis of stipulated testimony (Decision at p. 2).  Furthermore, the 
Judge specifically noted that Applicant denies that he engaged in the sexual misconduct with his minor daughter (Decision at p. 3).</P> 
<P>The fourth and fifth claimed factual errors pertain to the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant tested positive for marijuana when he reported for his 
court-ordered evaluation in October 2001 (Decision at p. 3). There is record evidence that supports a finding that Applicant was ordered </P> 
<P>to undergo drug and alcohol evaluation and that he tested positive for cannabis.  <EM>See</EM> Exhibit 7.  The record evidence also shows that Applicant has denied 
repeatedly that he ever used marijuana.  However, there is no record evidence to support Applicant's appeal claim that a subsequent test proved the first test 
result was a false positive.  Applicant stated he believed the first test result was positive.  <EM>See</EM> Exhibit 17 at p. 6.  But there is no record evidence that shows that 
the first sample was retested and determined to be a false positive.  Indeed, Applicant testified that he asked for the sample to be re-tested and was told his 
request was denied.  <EM>See</EM> Hearing Transcript at p. 22.  The Board need not consider the significance of the positive marijuana test result in this case because a 
reading of the decision below in its entirety persuades us that the results of the marijuana test were not material to the Judge's adverse decision, which was 
based on his findings and conclusions concerning Applicant's sexual misconduct with his minor daughter.</P> 
<P>The sixth claimed factual error (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the Administrative Judge erred by rejecting Applicant's denials of sexual misconduct with his minor daughter) fails to 
demonstrate error below.  As a general proposition, an applicant is collaterally estopped from denying he or she engaged in conduct that underlies a felony 
criminal conviction, regardless of whether the conviction is based on a guilty plea or not.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0116 (May 1, 2000) at p. 2.  The doctrine 
of collateral estoppel also applies if an applicant's conviction is based on an <EM>Alford</EM> plea.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0525 (June 17, 1997) at pp. 2-3.  
Although the Board has held that a conviction based on a <EM>nolo contendere</EM> plea does not collaterally estop an applicant from contending he or she is really 
innocent of the conduct for which he or she was convicted, the Board has noted there may be a need to change that position.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 96-0525 (June 
17, 1997) at p. 3 n.3.  Resolution of this appeal does not require the Board to decide whether Applicant's conviction was based on an <EM>Alford</EM> plea or a <EM>nolo 
contendere</EM> plea, or whether the Board should change its position as suggested in footnote 3 of ISCR Case No. 96-0525 (June 17, 1997).  Even 
assuming--solely for the purposes of deciding this appeal--that Applicant was not collaterally estopped from contending he is innocent of the criminal conduct 
for which he was convicted, the Judge could reasonably find that Applicant committed the acts of sexual misconduct with his minor daughter.  There is 
conflicting record evidence on whether Applicant engaged in acts of sexual misconduct with his daughter.  The Judge had the opportunity to personally observe 
Applicant's demeanor during his hearing testimony, assess the credibility of Applicant's testimony on the matter, and weigh Applicant's denials of wrongdoing 
in light of Judge's credibility determination and the record evidence as a whole.  Giving due deference to the Judge's credibility determination,<A HREF="02-03248.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> the conflicting 
record evidence plus the Judge's negative assessment of Applicant's credibility -- taken together -- provided a legally sufficient basis for the Judge to find that 
Applicant engaged in acts of sexual misconduct with his minor daughter.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because the Judge did not cite any 
complaints against Applicant for mishandling classified information and Applicant's conviction did not lead to his mishandling of classified information</SPAN>.  
Applicant states that he has maintained a security clearance throughout the process without incident and that the Administrative Judge did not cite any instances 
in which Applicant mishandled classified information.  Applicant also asserts there is no indication that his conviction lead to any security misconduct by 
Applicant.  However, the Administrative Judge must consider the security significance of the conduct that Applicant did engage in.  The United States must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information. <EM>Snepp v. United States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  
The overall facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant's involvement in criminal sexual misconduct with his minor daughter provided a rational basis for 
the Administrative Judge's doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability and security eligibility, whether or not he was still vulnerable to pressure or coercion 
involving the underlying conduct. <EM> See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 96-0587 (March 24, 1997) at pp. 3-4.  Given those doubts, the Judge reasonably resolved them in 
favor of the national security.  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  Furthermore, Applicant's false statements to security 
investigators provided a rational and sufficient basis for the Administrative Judge's unfavorable security clearance decision, even in the absence of any evidence 
that Applicant has ever committed a security violation. <EM> Cf</EM>. ISCR Case No. 03-05176 (August 11, 2004) at pp. 3-4.</P>
