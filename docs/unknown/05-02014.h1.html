<P>Applicant was convicted of sexually abusing his three stepdaughters in 1994, and served three years in prison. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns his 
sexual behavior, criminal conduct, and personal conduct have created. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On September 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct), Guideline D (sexual behavior), and Guideline E (personal conduct). The SOR also 
alleges that 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 disqualifies Applicant from having a security clearance granted or renewed. Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that 
was received by DOHA on October 20, 2005, admitted all SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on December 21, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on January 4, 2006, scheduling the hearing for January 19, 2006.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6. GE 1-5 were 
admitted into the record and administrative notice was taken of the information contained in GE 6, all without objection. Applicant testified, called three 
witnesses to testify on his behalf, and submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits 1-7, and admitted into the record without 
objection. The transcript was received on January 27, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 59 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor to provide integrated logistics support since October 2002. He was employed by a 
different government contractor as a senior administrative specialist from November 2000 until October 2002, and before that as an administrative assistant by 
two separate employers from February 1999 until June 2000. He was unemployed from December 1997 until February 1999. Applicant served in the U. S. 
Navy from January 1967 until April 1989, and retired as a chief petty officer (paygrade E-7). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was married in April 1967 and divorced in March 1972. His only child, an adult son, was born from this marriage. He remarried in November 1979 
and that marriage ended in divorce in March 1983. He married again in January 1993 and that marriage ended in divorce in June 1997. He has now been 
remarried since August 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with Lewd and Lascivious Act with a Child in April 1986. He provided a statement in February 2005 to a Special Agent (SA) from the 
Defense Security Service (DSS) in which he indicated two neighborhood girls, ages five and seven, unexpectedly entered his bedroom while he was changing 
and saw him naked. His hearing testimony makes clear he intended to expose himself to the girls (Tr. p. 37). The girl's version of the incident indicated there 
was substantially more to the incident including his rubbing oil on their bodies and being naked in bed with them (Tr. p. 37). Applicant was released from 
custody after 72 hours and was not prosecuted for the offense, apparently because of a technical mistake involving the questioning of the girls (Tr. p. 38). 
Applicant did participate for about six months in therapy following this incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although it is not alleged in the SOR, Applicant testified he fondled a girl who was approximately 11 years old in 1989. In the statement he provided to the 
DSS, Applicant stated he was not arrested in 1990, however, his arrest record (GE 4) discloses he was charged with child molesting on September 26, 1990. 
The arrest record does not provide a disposition for the charge, and the evidence is unclear if this is the same illicit sexual conduct with a child he testified he 
committed in 1989.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant sexually abused each of his three stepdaughters from his third marriage. The girls were eight, ten, and twelve years old at the time of the abuse, which 
occurred on a dozen or more occasions over the course of nearly a year in 1993/94. In the DSS statement, Applicant attempted to place much of the blame for 
his perverse behavior on the girl's mother. He claimed in the statement that for the most part his conduct consisted of sexually fondling the girls, although he 
did admit as to the eight-year-old: "touching her all over with a finger and mouth and in one case rubbed against her vagina with my penis" (GE 3, pp. 2-3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was aware the two older girls had been previously sexually abused which made them more vulnerable to his illicit actions (GE 5, p. 2). The youngest 
girl eventually disclosed that Applicant had engaged in sexual intercourse with her (GE 5, p. 2). Applicant initially testified he did not engage in sexual 
intercourse with the youngest girl, although he admitted on one occasion they were naked and his penis contacted her vagina  (Tr. p. 31). He later explained his 
denial as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE: You deny that there was sexual intercourse?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(Name omitted): Well, it goes back to Clinton and what he said. She sat on my lap with my penis exposed and no panties on and slid up and down on me. I 
ejaculated. That was the one and only time. She -</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE: And how old was she at the time?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(Name omitted): Nine. She put my penis in her mouth once, but I didn't ejaculate. It was just momentarily.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of three counts (one count for each of his stepdaughters) of Lewd or Lascivious Acts with a Child Under 14 in September 1994. He 
was sentenced to serve six years in prison on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. Applicant actually served about three years in prison, and was then 
required to serve two years in a rehabilitation center, which was then followed by three years supervised probation/parole (GE 2). He participated in sexual 
offender treatment from the time of his release from prison until about 2000, but has not continued in treatment since then. He is required to register as a sexual 
offender. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's witnesses and character reference letters speak very highly of him personally and as an employee. At least some of those people, including his 
present wife, are aware of his criminal history and do not believe he is a risk to re-offend. However, his co-workers are unaware of his sexual misconduct, and 
at least one of his witnesses who was aware that Applicant had been in prison for child molestation testified: "Basically, that with his woman he was with, there 
was lewd and inappropriate conduct with minors" (Tr. p. 44). The witness was unaware of any of the details of the criminal conduct that sent Applicant to 
prison.            </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J, 
pertaining to criminal conduct, Guideline D, pertaining to sexual behavior, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, 
are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="05-02014.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although he was not prosecuted, the evidence establishes that Applicant committed the criminal offenses he was accused of in 1986. In 1994, he was convicted 
of sexually abusing each of his three stepdaughters. He served approximately three years in prison, followed by two years in a rehabilitation center, and then 
three more years on probation/parole. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges offenses that occurred in 1986 and 1994. Additionally, although not alleged and therefore not a separate disqualifying incident, Applicant 
sexually abused at least one additional child in 1989/90. Although the last offense occurred in 1994, Applicant did not complete his prison sentence, residence 
in a rehabilitation center, and supervised probation/parole until approximately 2002. He has not participated in any sexual offender aftercare treatment since 
2000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the number of children Applicant has victimized, the number of years his criminal conduct spanned, the relatively short time he has been off 
supervision, the lack of continuing treatment, and his obvious continuing efforts to minimize his deviant criminal conduct, I find Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: 
The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM> and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation</EM> do not apply. Applicant has failed to meet his burden to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case 
against him. Guideline J is decided against Applicant. Further, the three-year prison sentence Applicant served disqualifies him from having a security clearance 
granted or renewed under the statutory disqualification imposed by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline D, sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the 
individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant sexually abused two very young girls in 1987, and his three young stepdaughters in 1993/94. His admitted deviant criminal activity with his eight-year-old stepdaughter is particularly repulsive, and, although he minimizes much of the sexual abuse he committed on all his victims, it is clear from their 
accounts and his testimony that he was a child sexual predator for many years. Further, while some people know of his criminal activity, he appears to have 
minimized it to at least some of them, and his co-workers are unaware of it at all.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted</EM>; DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>; and 4:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment</EM> apply in this 
case. For the same reasons discussed under Guideline J above, I find MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a 
similar nature</EM> does not apply. Applicant's continued minimization of his deviant criminal conduct is sufficient reason to find that MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is no other 
evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability</EM> inapplicable. Guideline D is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant's criminal sexual abuse of young girls makes DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Reliable, unfavorable information 
provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>; and DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases 
an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, 
or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail </EM>applicable to this case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's co-workers and most likely other associates are unaware of his criminal history. Accordingly. MC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual has taken positive steps to 
significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM> does not apply. The remaining mitigating conditions have no application to 
this case. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his sexual behavior, 
criminal conduct, and personal conduct. He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
