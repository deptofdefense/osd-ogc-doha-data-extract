<P>        The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865
and Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 13, 1997 to the
Applicant that detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or
continue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative
Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, denied or
revoked. </P>

<P>       A copy of the SOR is attached to this decision and is included herein by reference.    </P>

<P>       On March 14, 1997, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR.  Applicant
elected to have the case determined on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P>

<P>A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was issued by Department Counsel on April 11, 1997. 
Applicant was notified that he could respond to the FORM by May 29, 1997.  Applicant did not
submit any such response.  This case was assigned to me on July 14, 1997, after being reassigned
from another Administrative Judge.    </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"> <U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></P>

<P>        After a thorough review of all of the evidence in this case, including Applicant's response to
the SOR and to the File of Relevant Material, and upon due consideration of all of the evidence,
this Administrative Judge makes the following findings of fact as to the Criterion F (Financial
Considerations) allegations in the SOR:</P>

<P>        Applicant is a 40 year old male employed as a technician by Company A, a defense
contractor, since about 1995.  His employer is seeking a security clearance for Applicant (level
not mentioned in the case file).  Applicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  Those
admissions are accepted and incorporated into the following findings of fact:  </P>

<P>        Allegation 1.a. -- Applicant is indebted to  gasoline company A in the amount of $26.00, for
an amount delinquent since at least July 1993.  As of March 1997, this debt had not been
satisfied.</P>

<P>        Allegation 1.b. -- Applicant is indebted to Bank B in the amount of $3,316.20, for an
account charged off in about October 1993.  As of October 9, 1996.  Bannot observed at his place
of employment on several Monday mornings prior to June 1993, to have the odor of alcohol on
his person.  Applicant denied this allegation and the Government did not introduce any evidence
in support of the allegation (<EM>See </EM>FORM, p.3. at Footnote 2).  </P>

<P>        Allegation 1.c. -- Applicant was arrested on June 12, 1993, in State B and charged with
driving While Intoxicated (DWI).  He had a blood alcohol level of .18 %.  He was found guilty,
sentenced to serve 90 days in jail, suspended, fined $350.00 and order to pay $46.00 court costs,
hd his driver's license suspended for one year and was ordered to attend an Alcohol Safety
Action Program (ASAP).  Prior to 1993, Applicant had been arrested once before for DWI (date
unknown). </P>

<P>         Allegation 1.d. -- As a result of his 1993 DWI arrest and conviction, Applicant was
suspended from work for five days in June 1993 by his employer.  Applicant had been on duty
and driving a company rented car at the time of his arrest. </P>

<P>         Allegation 1.e. -- Applicant received treatment from July 15, 1993 to October 11, 1993, at
Clinic A in his state of residence.  His condition was diagnosed as Alcohol Abuse.</P>

<P>At the time, he was "beset with many problems, intoxicated, evicted from home, being
divorced," and had possible suicidal thoughts.  He had been drinking two six-packs or more
(time frame not stated).  The stated short term goals in his treatment plan were for him to attend
AA meetings on a regular basis and to abstain from drinking.  He told the clinic that he had not
consumed alcohol for five and later six weeks.  The stated long term goals were Applicant's
continued attendance at AA and  remaining "alcohol free." </P>

<P>          Allegations 1.f. and 1.g. -- Applicant received treatment on September 7, 1995 at Hospital
B, for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Dependence.   Applicant then received inpatient
treatment from September 7, 1995 to November 27, 1995 at a treatment center in State C, for a
condition diagnosed as Alcohol Dependence.  Prior to his admission to the hospital, Applicant
had been "drinking all day" and "a lot all week."  Applicant had been drinking up to "3 - 6
packs" of beer "daily" since he was "18 years old."  Applicant hadn't "achieved any significant
periods of sobriety in the past 22 years."  </P>

<P>          Allegation 1.h. --Applicant received treatment from September 30, 1995 to November 27,
199 by a Licensed Mental Health Counselor for aftercare counseling for a condition diagnosed as
Alcohol Dependence.  The Counselor recommended that Applicant totally abstain from using
alcohol.  </P>

<P>           Allegation 1.i. -- Despite the repeated treatment and diagnoses of Alcohol Abuse in 1993
and Alcohol Dependence in 1995, and a recommendation that he totally abstain form consuming
alcohol, Applicant has continued to drink alcohol, until at least January 1997.  In his response to
the SOR in January 1997, Applicant indicated the likelihood that he would continue to do
consume alcohol, although not every day and not "during or in work."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>POLICIES</U></P>

<P>        The adjudication process established by DoD Directive 5220.6 is based on the whole person
concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into
account in reaching a decision as whether a person is a acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to
the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully considered according to the
pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required.  Each
adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of the seriousness, recency, frequency and
motivation for an Applicant's conduct; the circumstances or consequences involved; the age of
the Applicant; the presence or absence of rehabilitation; the potential for coercion or duress; and
the probability that the conduct will or will not recur in the future.  <EM>See </EM>Directive 5220.6, Section
F.3. and Enclosure 2.  </P>

<P>        Because each security cases presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be
assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally
in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be
sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available
information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or
emotionally unstable behavior. </P>

<P>         Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following
adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</P>

<P>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness. </P>

<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>       (1) alcohol - related incidents away from work, such a driving while under the influence,
fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use;</P>

<P>       (3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol
dependence<A HREF="97-0149.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>.</P>

<P>       (4) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment;</P>

<P>       (5) consumption of alcohol, subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed
medical professional and following completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. </P>

<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>        None apply</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">********</P>

<P>         Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, a decision to grant or
continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is
clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common
sense determination required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge can only draw those
inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In
addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the
credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as
well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly
safeguard classified information.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">Burden of Proof</P>

<P>       An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegation relieves the Government
of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information is denied or
otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those
controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden
(either by an applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and establishes conduct that creates
security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to
present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite
the existence of conduct that falls within specific criterion in the Directive, it is nevertheless
consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the
applicant. </P>

<P>       A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government based upon trust and confidence.  When the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a
heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As
noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the Applicant. </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><U>CONCLUSIONS</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">      </FONT>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and
factors, and having assessed the credibility of Applicant's written testimony, this Administrative
Judge concludes that the Government has established it case as to all SOR Criterion G
allegations except for allegation 1.b., as to which the Government has not offered any evidence.</P>

<P>       In his response to the SOR, Applicant denies allegations 1.a., 1.b. and 1.c..  He admits
allegations 1.d. through and including 1.i..  Considered along with other evidence, the record
evidence establishes that Applicant has a long history of excessive alcohol consumption
highlighted by two drunk driving offenses,<A HREF="97-0149.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>
<P> an alcohol related five day suspension from work in
1993, and four instances of what I conclude were failed treatments for alcohol abuse and
dependence, in 1993 and 1995. </P>

<P>      Government Exhibits 7, 8, 9 and 10 document Applicant's treatment.  GX 7 is the record of
treatment he received after his 1993 DWI arrest and conviction.  It is clear that Applicant was
advised to attend AA meetings on regular basis and to remain alcohol free.  It appears that
Applicant did not drink during the course of his treatment but it is also clear that he began
consuming alcohol again at some unknown point after the completion of the treatment.</P>

<P>       GX 8 establishes that by September 1995, he was again consuming substantial amounts of
alcohol, to the point that he received hospital treatment on September 5, 1995, at which time he
had been drinking beer all that day and "a lot all week."  He acknowledged being in the midst of
a divorce, having received a court order barring him from his household property being under
considerable stress.  He was diagnosed as suffering from alcohol intoxication, abuse, and
dependence.  He was transferred by ambulance to a detoxification center </P>

<P>       GX 9 establishes that Applicant had been drinking "3 -6 packs" of beer "daily" and had been
drinking since he was 18 years old.  He acknowledged a long history of alcoholism and a
previous attempt at detoxification "years ago," which may be the 1993 treatment after his DWI
conviction.  He also acknowledged no "significant periods of sobriety in the past 22 years," i.e.,
since 1973.  He admitted a legal history of "2 DUIs."  He indicated an ability to "identify the
warning signs for relapse."  His final diagnosis, dated September 20, 1995, was "alcohol
dependence ... severe."  GX 10 is a September 20, 1997 letter from the detoxification center
certifying  Applicant's suitability for returning to work.   </P>

<P>       Applicant's abuse of alcohol is particularly significant in the context of his suitability for
access to classified information because of the long history of abuse, resulting in two DWI
arrests, a pattern of failed treatments, and what I conclude is a continuing lack of understanding
by Applicant of the negative impact of his alcohol abuse on his life, particularly on his
employment and his security clearance eligibility.  Considering his diagnoses and promises
during his 1995 treatments and his admission that he continues to consume alcohol, I conclude
that it is not unlikely that he will abuse alcohol in the future to the same degree that he did in the
past.  In other words, it is not clear to me that Applicant has learned any lessons from what he
has gone through.  My conclusions are necessarily based on the evidence before me and that
evidence, establishing a long pattern of alcohol related poor judgment, unreliability and
untrustworthiness, remains unrefuted by any substantial evidence to the contrary.  </P>

<P>      While there is no evidence Applicant's alcohol abuse has had any direct impact on his work,
it is well recognized that security clearance eligibility is a 24 hour a day requirement.  A person
who fails to adequately control his life in the private sector is not entitled to the level of
confidence and trust required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets.  I have given
particular attention to Applicant's January 11, 1997 response to the SOR.  I accept Applicant's
statement that he has possessed a security clearance for 23 years with no problems and that he
has worked six days a week without missing any time at work due to </P>

<P>his drinking.  Nevertheless, his admitted consumption of alcohol, in the context of his history of
abuse, and continuing even after he learned of the its possible negative effect on how the
Government viewed his security clearance suitability, cannot be ignored. </P>
