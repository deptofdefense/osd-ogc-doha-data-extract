<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under  Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated February 26, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. She requested that her case be decided on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. On July 8, 2003, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM)  <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to the Applicant, and she was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant submitted a timely response to the FORM on August 25, 2003. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on September 9, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered seven documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 7). Applicant offered several exhibits which were introduced in the 
FORM. The only original document was a one page, updated financial statement of Applicant (Exhibit A).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration 
of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is a 25 year old employee of a defense contractor. She is a high school graduate and has never been<STRONG> </STRONG>married.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">On February 27, 1996, Applicant<STRONG> </STRONG>was arrested for shoplifting at a department store, and she was charged with Petit Larceny. She plead guilty and was ordered to 
pay a fine and court costs totaling approximately $200. She was given a deferred sentence and ordered to serve one year probation (Exhibits 5 and 7).<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has admitted owing four debts as of May 8, 2002, under Adjudicative Guideline F .  These debts were all long overdue, most for several years. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Debt 1 was in the amount of approximately $476. Debt 2 was in the amount of approximately $187. Debt 3 was is in the amount of approximately $737, and 
debt 4 was in the amount of $1,378.<STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant has made some payments on debts 2 and 3, but no payments have been made on debts 1 and 4<STRONG> </STRONG>(Exhibits 3 and 6).<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant completed a signed, sworn </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security Clearance Application (SCA)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> on April 3, 2001 (Exhibit 4).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #26 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? 
Applicant answered "no" to this question. The evidence shows, as discussed above, that Applicant was arrested on February 26, 1996, and plead guilty  to the 
charge of Petit Larceny. Applicant should have answered "yes" to this question and included this arrest in the response to question #26.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #38 asks,  "In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" Applicant answered "no" to this question. At the time she 
completed the SCA, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was delinquent on all of the debts discussed above, and she should have answered "yes" to this question and included all of the 
debts listed in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><CENTER><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Question #39 asks, "Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt (s)?" Applicant answered "no" to this question. At the time she completed the SCA, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was delinquent on all of the debts discussed above, and she should have answered "yes" to this question and included all of the debts listed in the 
SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully 
considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative 
guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or 
mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or 
against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.1. <EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable 
clearance action or administrative termination of this processing for clearance eligibility:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Concern:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.2.1. Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.2.2. A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A10.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">None.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and 
the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM></EM> case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> With respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided false material information to the Government 
in response to three questions on the SCA that she executed in April 2001. Applicant knew, or should have known, that the three questions required affirmative 
responses and information regarding her criminal history and her overdue debts.  There is no reasonable explanation for her not providing this information.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking access to our nation's secrets. When such an individual intentionally falsifies 
material facts on a security clearance application, it is extremely difficult to conclude that she nevertheless possesses the judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness required of clearance holders. In this case, Applicant's falsifications of her SCA occurred less than three years ago, and her failure to offer any 
independent evidence indicating that she has reformed and is now reliable and trustworthy, precludes a finding that it is now clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant her access to classified information. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E,  I conclude that DC </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">E2.A5.1.2.2. applies because the information that Applicant provided in 
her SCA was known or should have been known by her to be an omission and concealment of relevant and material facts.  No Mitigating Condition (MC) 
apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</STRONG>  The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's 
indebtedness. It shows Applicant has a history of financial difficulties.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her financial obligations falls within Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3. I find that no MC is applicable to this case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant appears to have finally made an effort to resolve her indebtedness and has begun making payments to two of her creditors.  However, since 
Applicant's other debts have not yet been addressed, I cannot conclude that Applicant's financial problems are resolved. Until her past due debts are paid, and 
she can establish a record of financial responsibility and stability, security concerns will continue to exist under Guideline F. I resolve Guideline F. against 
Applicant</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in a criminal act by intentionally giving 
false or misleading information on the SCA that she completed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">on April 3, 2001, as stated in SOR 1.a. and 1.b.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The law, which Applicant violated, is Title 18, 
United States Code, Section 1001, which is a felony.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
