<P>Applicant, a natural born United States citizen, married a Russian woman in November 1998 whom he met through a friend whose wife was teaching at a 
university in Moscow. Applicant now resides with his wife who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2004. Her father and sister are citizens and residents 
of Russia, and she has traveled to Russia to visit them on a number of occasions since she immigrated to the United States. Applicant has failed to mitigate the 
foreign influence security concern that exists in this case. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 18, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges a security concern under Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on June 4, 2004, 
admitted some and denied other SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on September 10, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on November 4, 2004, scheduling the hearing for December 3, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5. GE 1 was 
admitted into the record, and administrative notice was taken of the information contained in GE 2-5 without objection. Applicant testified, and called his wife 
and a friend to testify on his behalf. The transcript was received on December 9, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations contained in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and 
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 58-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor as a system engineer since August 1998. He was previously employed as a 
system engineer by a different defense contractor from January 1990 to October 1997, and was unemployed from November 1997 to August 1998. Applicant 
enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in July 1967, obtained a commission after approximately seven years of service, and retired as a major in July 1988. Applicant 
had a top-secret security clearance, frequently with sensitive compartmented information access, from about 1967 until 1997. No complaints were ever made 
alleging he had mishandled or compromised classified information, and no action was ever taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance other than for solely 
administrative purposes.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant first married in December 1966, and that marriage ended in divorce in October 1984. He has two sons, ages 36 and 32, and one daughter, age 29, 
from that marriage. Applicant married his present wife on November 28, 1998. He resides with her in a house that he has owned since October 1991.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant met his wife through a friend he had known in the Air Force who is still on active duty. The friend's wife began teaching at a university in Moscow in 
1992, and one of her first students was the woman who would become Applicant's wife. The friend, while serving as a military attache in a country other than 
Russia, visited his wife in Russia who arranged for the woman to act as his tour guide. The friend and his wife, apparently deciding Applicant and the woman 
would make a good couple, played matchmaker and arranged for Applicant to spend time showing the woman the sights when she visited the U.S. in August 
1997.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant notified his employer of his actions, and then spent two days escorting the woman on sightseeing excursions during her visit. They corresponded by 
telephone and e-mail on a frequent basis after she returned to Russia, apparently leading her to visit the U.S. and Applicant again in approximately December 
1997. She then returned to Russia, they continued to correspond, and she again visited Applicant in the U.S. in about May 1998. Following that visit she again 
returned to Russia where she resided until immigrating to the U.S. to marry Applicant in either October or November 1998. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife was a Russian citizen, and was employed as a lecturer at a university in Moscow when they  met. She taught English, and before that 
chemistry, at the university. Her father, two sisters, and three nephews all were citizens and residents of Russia at the time of the marriage. Her father is 
presently 85 years old. He served in the Russian Army during World War II, and received severe wounds that resulted in the amputation of one of his legs. 
Some time after the war he worked as a civil servant, and then he began teaching at a military university in Russia, where he worked until he retired in 
approximately 1992. He has traveled to the U.S. twice to visit Applicant and his wife, once in July 1999, and again in December 1999. Applicant's wife speaks 
with her father on a somewhat frequent, albeit irregular, basis that she describes as sometimes twice a month and then maybe not for three months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Both of Applicant's Russian sisters-in-law came to the U.S. in 1998 for the wedding. One of those women was subsequently diagnosed with cancer, and came 
to the U.S. to seek treatment. She resided with Applicant and his wife until the time of her death. Applicant's remaining sister-in-law and two of his nephews, 
the children of the deceased sister-in-law, came to the U.S. to attend the funeral. They returned for a visit in 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife has returned to Russia on a number of occasions since the marriage. He estimates she returned six to seven times, annually at first, and twice a 
year for the last three to four years. She estimates she has visited Russia a total of four to five times since moving permanently to the U.S. She last visited 
Russia in May 2004 for ten days, and before that in December 2003 for four weeks. She speaks with her sister and nephews by telephone about every other 
week. Applicant testified his wife also maintains contact with a dean at the university in Moscow, friends in Russia, and other Russian citizens who are in the 
U.S.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife owns an apartment and a parking space in Russia. He places the value of the apartment at $20-40,000.00, and the parking space at $3,000.00. 
She values the apartment at $50,000.00, and the parking space at $3,000.00. The apartment space is rented to a student for $125.00 per month, with the money 
going to Applicant's sister-in-law to help provide for the children of the deceased sister. Applicant's father-in-law uses the parking space. Applicant's wife 
sends other money and items to her family in Russia, and the estimate of her total contribution to her relatives in Russia, including the apartment rent, is 
approximately $2,500.00 annually.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife became a naturalized U.S. citizen on July 30, 2004. She has not taken any action to renounce her Russian citizenship, and has not applied for a 
U.S. passport.<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She is employed as a lecturer at a major state university in the chemistry department. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant estimates he has $200-300,000.00 equity in his house that he values at about $550,000.00. He has something less than $200,000.00 in two 401K 
accounts, his wife has about $50,000.00 in a 401K account, and they have approximately $5,000.00 in a savings account.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B, 
pertaining to foreign influence, with its DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a

than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN>. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon the allegations in the SOR, Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of 
affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>; DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their 
citizenship status, if the potential for adverse influence or duress exists</EM>; and DC 8: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign influence  </EM>must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1 and 2 both apply in this case because Applicant's wife maintains dual citizenship with Russia, and her father and sister are citizens and residents of 
Russia. His wife's frequent telephone contact with her sister, nephews, and father, and her travel to Russia, and her relatives travel to the U.S. demonstrate the 
close ties of affection she has with those individuals, and Applicant's vicarious obligation to them. DC 8 applies based upon the property Applicant's wife owns 
in Russia.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Once the government meets its burden of proving controverted facts<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence demonstrating extenuation, 
mitigation, or changed circumstances.<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  Further, the government is under no duty to present evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating 
conditions, and an Administrative Judge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the government does not 
present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.<A HREF="03-14548.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The following Mitigating Conditions (MC) must be evaluated in determining whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant under Guideline B: MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, 
brothers, sisters), cohabitants, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the Untied States</EM>; MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens 
are casual and infrequent</EM>; and MC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There is no evidence to permit finding that Applicant, his wife, and his in-laws are not in a position to be exploited by Russia. Her family members are citizens 
and residents of that country, and she has traveled to Russia as recently as the May 2004. Based upon the past travel history it is reasonable to expect that 
Applicant's wife will likely travel to Russia in the future. Their presence in Russia places them in the position to be exploited by the Russian government. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In considering the possibility of exploitation by the Russian government it would be foolhardy to ignore the history of espionage committed against the U.S. by 
the Soviet Union and Russia that continued long after the downfall of the Soviet Union, as evidenced by the arrest of an FBI agent in 2001 as he attempted to 
pass classified documents to Russian agents. MC 1 is inapplicable in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As discussed above, Applicant's wife's contacts with her father and sister in Russia are clearly indicative of the continuing close relationship she has with them. 
Her contact is neither casual nor infrequent, and, accordingly, MC 3 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife placed the value of the property she owns in Russia at $53,000.00. She clearly is in a better position to evaluate that property than the 
somewhat lower figure supplied by Applicant, and, accordingly, that is the value I will use. Applicant estimates the equity value of his house, his savings, and 
his and his wife's retirement accounts to be in the neighborhood of $455-555,000.00. Adding in some value for automobiles, furniture, and the like still leaves 
the value of the property in Russia at as much as 10% of their net worth. The value of the property in Russia cannot be said to be minimal or insufficient to 
affect an individual's security responsibilities, either standing alone or as a percentage of the family assets. Accordingly, MC 8 does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance eligibility decisions are determinations in terms of the national interest,</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">and are in no sense a determination of the loyalty of the applicant. There is no reason to question Applicant's or his wife's loyalty to the United States. 
However, in all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern, and the ultimate question to be answered is whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified 
information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on 
its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Having done so, I am 
unable to conclude that Applicant has presented sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to overcome the case against him. Accordingly, 
Guideline B is decided against Applicant.    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P>
