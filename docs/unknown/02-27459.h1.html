<P>Applicant's father is  a citizen of Vietnam and  resides in Vietnam. He is long retired and not in a position to be exploited by Vietnam in a way that could force 
Applicant to choose between loyalty to this family member and his loyalty to the United States. Applicant has given some money to his father in Vietnam, but 
the amount is not significant. Applicant's strong attachment to the United States and minimal ties to Vietnam makes it unlikely that he would respond favorably 
to any efforts to act against United States interests.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, issued an undated Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended 
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">October14, 2003</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant submitted a signed and sworn response to the SOR. Applicant initially requested that his case be decided on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing.  On January 27, 2004, Applicant requested  a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 29, 2004, this case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to 
the parties on May 7, 2004, and the hearing was held on June 1, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered two documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 and 2), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered no documentary 
exhibit and offered his own testimony. The record was held open subsequent to the hearing, and Applicant offered five documents. These consisted of four 
letters of reference (Exhibits A- D) and one evaluation (Exhibit E), which were entered into evidence without objection.   The transcript (TR) was received on 
July 1, 2004. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's father is not a United 
States citizen and resides in Vietnam, and Applicant has traveled to his native Vietnam on five occasions. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., 
under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all four allegations. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 46 year old.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense 
sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He received a Bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from a United States university in 1975 and a graduate degree in 1979.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Vietnam. In 1975, during the fall of South Vietnam, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">'s father, who </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the South 
Vietnamese army</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, arranged transportation, by a United States military plane, for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, his  grandmother, mother, brother, </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and sister to evacuate Vietnam. When they left Vietnam, they were taken to the United States, where they remained </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 17-19)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. His mother and grandmother 
are now deceased. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> became a naturalized United States citizen in 1983. His wife was born in Vietnam, and, like her husband, she became a naturalized United States 
citizen in 1983. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">They have two children, who were born in the United States and are United States citizens (Tr at 21- 22)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> brother and sister, and 
their spouses and children, are all United States citizens.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After the fall of Saigon in 1975, because of his position with the South Vietnamese army, Applicant's  father was placed in what was essentially a prison for 13 
years, and he was not released until 1988. He has  remained  a citizen of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Vietnam and continues to reside in Vietnam</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. He planned to move to the United States, 
but after Applicant's mother died he decided not to move.  He is retired and has no contact with the Vietnamese government. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> last saw his father 
approximately 4 years ago, and he speaks to him by telephone once a month. Applicant has never been contacted by the government of Vietnam regarding his 
father, either during the years he was imprisoned or since his release (Tr at 18-20). Applicant and his brother and sister each contribute approximately $100 a 
month to his father. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has traveled to Vietnam on five occasions, since he first moved to the United States in 1975. They were all casual trips, either to see his father or to 
show his children the country in which he was born (Tr at 30-31).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no financial interest or property in Vietnam. He testified that he considers himself to be only an American, since he has live here since he was 
seventeen years of age, and  that he would never do anything to compromise the United States. If his father was ever threatened by the government of Vietnam, 
he would report it to the proper United States authorities (Tr at 34-35). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a number of letters of reference on his behalf, from coworkers, a relative, and a supervisor on his behalf.  The letters spoke highly about his 
honesty and trustworthiness </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Exhibits A- D)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> considered</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father is a citizen of Vietnam and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">resides in</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Vietnam. The Vietnam citizenship and residency of a member of Applicant's immediate 
family creates the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such a tie raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, 
extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security 
clearance for him. This </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> has done. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The evidence of a father, who is a citizen of resides in Vietnam, comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1.   The fact that the foreign country in 
question is Vietnam, a country under Communist rule,  is also a concern, but that fact is not automatically controlling. Based on the nature of the overall record 
and the totality of the evidence, including: the age and lack of government involvement of Applicant's father, Applicant's long history since coming to the 
United States, his ties to  all of his family members who are United States citizens, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and  his testimony about his feelings concerning the United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, I have 
determined that his father in Vietnam does not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1.  applies. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does contribute some funds to his father under DC E2.A2.1.2.8., but the amount is small. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that MC E2.A2.1.3.5. applies because t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he 
financial interests are not </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">significant enough to cause Applicant to do anything which would be contrary to the interests of the United States. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR, and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities.</SPAN></P>
