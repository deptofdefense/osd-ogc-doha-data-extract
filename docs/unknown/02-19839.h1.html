<P>Applicant's wife, a citizen of Vietnam, resides with him in the United States. Applicant has a grandfather and mother-in-law, who are citizens of and reside in 
Vietnam, but his contacts with them are infrequent. None of these people are in a position to be exploited by Vietnam in a way that could force Applicant to 
choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States. Applicant has given some money to his mother-in-law in Vietnam, but the 
amount is not significant. Applicant's strong attachment to the United States and minimal ties to Vietnam makes it unlikely that he would respond favorably to 
any efforts to act against United States interests.  Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN>March 17, 2003<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant submitted a signed and sworn response to the SOR. Applicant requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 5, 2003, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on May 6, 2003, because of caseload consideration, the case was reassigned to me 
to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on May 7, 2003, and the hearing was held on May 21, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 3), and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 10 documentary 
exhibit (Exhibit A- J) and offered his own testimony and the testimony of two other witness. The transcript (TR) was received on June 2, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, and 
other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not United States citizens or may be subject to duress, that he has </SPAN> given 
some money to his mother-in-law and grandfather<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in Vietnam, and that he has traveled to his native Vietnam on a number of occasions. </SPAN>The SOR contains five 
allegations, 1.a. through 1.e., under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all five allegations. These allegations are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 36 year old employee of a defense contractor.  He <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in Vietnam in 1966, and together with his family, he moved to the United States in 
1981. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1989. Applicant's parents and siblings also became citizens of the United States. He received a 
bachelors degree in science from a United States university in 1997.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife was born in Vietnam, married the Applicant in the year 2000 and immigrated to the United States in 2001. She is now a permanent legal 
resident of the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States and plans to apply to become a naturalized United States citizen when she is eligible in 2004. (Tr at 27, 28.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother in-law and </SPAN>grandfather<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and reside in Vietnam</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. In the year 2002 Applicant contributed approximately $1,500 to his mother-in-law and nothing to his grandfather.  In 2003, at the time of the hearing, he had thus far contributed $500 to his mother-in-law and nothing to his grandfather. (Tr 
at 28-30.) Applicant communicates by telephone to his grandfather approximately once a month and sporadically to his mother-in-law.  Applicant's grandfather 
is over 80 years old and a retired carpenter. Applicant's mother-in-law is an ex-street vendor.  Neither of them has ever worked for the Vietnam government. 
(Tr at 31, 32.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has traveled to Vietnam in 1994 and 2000 to see his grandfather. He also visited Vietnam twice in the year 2000, and once more in 2001, to arrange 
for his marriage to his wife and to bring her to the United States. (Tr at 45-47.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified that he considers himself to be an American since he has lived in the United States longer than he lived in Vietnam, and this country has 
been very good to him. He testified that he would never do anything to compromise the United States. (Tr at 59, 60.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to Applicant, two witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant.  The first witness </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is the direct supervisor of Applicant for the company by which Applicant is employed.   The witness testified that he has worked closely with Applicant for the 
last four years, and Applicant is an exemplary employee. He further testified that he has submitted hundreds of employees for a security position and of all these 
people, he holds Applicant in the highest regard.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 62-71.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The second witness was Applicant's wife.  She testified that she intends to stay in the United States and become a United States citizen as soon as she is 
eligible, which she believes will be in 2004. She also hopes to have children and raise them in the United States. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 75-78.)</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (<EM>See</EM> Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>FOREIGN INFLUENCE (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.8. A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign 
influence.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.3. Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.5. Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN>Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN>Applicant's wife is a citizen of Vietnam, and he has two<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> immediate family members who are citizens of and reside in</SPAN> Vietnam. The Vietnam 
citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern 
sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  The evidence of a wife, who is a citizen of Vietnam, and the existence of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN>, who are citizens of and reside in Vietnam comes within 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1.  The fact that the foreign country in question is Vietnam, a country under Communist rule,  is also a concern, but that fact is 
not automatically controlling. Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including: the lack of government involvement of 
Applicant's family members, Applicant's history since coming to the United States,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and  his extremely strong testimony about his feelings concerning the 
United States</SPAN>, I have determined that his wife and his family members in Vietnam do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and Mitigating Conditions 
(MC) 1 applies.  MC 3 also applies because Applicant's contacts with his foreign relatives in Vietnam is casual and infrequent.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant does contribute some funds to his mother-in-law under DC  8, but the amount is not significant . <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that MC 5 applies because t</SPAN>he financial 
interests are not <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">significant enough to cause Applicant to do anything which would be contrary to the interests of the United States. </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>         After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the 
SOR and even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the 
incident to the proper authorities. </P>
