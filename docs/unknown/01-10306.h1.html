<P>While security concerns arose over Applicant's foreign preference because of his dual citizenship and use of his foreign passport twice after he 
became a naturalized United States (US) citizen in May 1999, he voluntarily chose to comply with the Department of Defense (DoD) policy 
requirements when he learned of them: he relinquished his passport and also renounced his foreign citizenship in August 2001.  Although his wife 
and he have relatives who are citizens of a foreign country, they do not have ties to the government, are not agents of a foreign power.  Nor could 
they be exploited by a foreign power in a way that would force him to choose between his ties to them and to the US.  So, he has mitigated the 
allegations of foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government could not reach the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant,<A HREF="01-10306.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> so the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on 
July 5, 2001.  The SOR detailed security concerns in paragraph 1 over foreign preference (Guideline C) and in paragraph 2 over foreign influence 
(Guideline B).  Applicant received the SOR and replied to these SOR allegations in an Answer forwarded on July 31, 2001, by his counsel.  He 
admitted  all allegations and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on August 30, 2001, attested it was Ready 
to Proceed.</P> 
 
<P>On August 30, 2001, the case was assigned to me.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to and a Notice of Hearing 
was issued on September 18, 2001, which set the matter for October 9, 2001, at a location near where Applicant works and lives.  At the hearing 
the Government introduced three exhibits which were admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1-3).   Applicant testified himself and called two other 
witnesses; he offered six exhibits (Exhibits A through F) which were admitted into evidence.  The  transcript (TR) was received on October 17, 
2001.</P>

</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Clarification</STRONG> <STRONG>of Department of Defense Policy on Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Department of Defense issued a policy memorandum on August 16, 2000.  It clarified the policy on Foreign Preference, Guideline C and 
stated, in part:</P> 
 
<P>The purpose of this memorandum is to clarify the application of Guideline C to cases involving an applicant's possession or use of a foreign 
passport.  The Guideline specifically provides that "possession and/or use of a foreign passport" may be a disqualifying condition.  It contains no 
mitigating factor related to the applicant's personal convenience, safety, requirements of foreign law, or the identity of the foreign country.  The only 
applicable mitigation factor addresses the official approval of the United States Government for the possession or use.  The security concerns 
underlying this guideline are that possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether the person's 
allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent 
application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official 
approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United State Government.  Modification of the Guideline is not required.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of 
Fact:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 53 years old, has been the president and CEO of an international company (Company #1) for five years and has traveled frequently on 
international business.  He has worked for Company #1 from 1969 to present.  He has worked for the company in the Caribbean and South 
America.  Because Company #1 does business with federal agencies, he has often worked with sensitive information.  In July 2000  he was asked 
to obtain a security clearance and completed an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) 
(SF 86) to seek a security clearance.  Previously,  he had not needed a security clearance.  (Exhibit 1 &amp; 2; Exhibit F; TR 20-26; TR 56-61)  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant married his wife (Ms. X) in May 1974, and she became a naturalized US citizen in 1999. His two daughters, born in 1977 and 1979,  
also became naturalized US citizens in 1999.  In 1974 he received a BA in business administration from a university in Argentina. (Exhibit 1; 
Exhibits A &amp; B; TR 20) </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Preference</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Argentina and voted there in the 1970's.  He left there in 1982 and  first came to the US in 1989 and wanted to become a 
US citizen.  However he had to travel internationally and in 1990 was assigned to a subsidiary company in another country on a temporary basis 
until 1993.  In 1993 he was approved to come back to the US as a permanent resident.  After living in the US for five years, he applied for 
citizenship and became a naturalized US citizen in May 1999.  His entire family became US citizens at the same time.  As a US citizen he has 
recently served on jury duty.  (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR 26-32, 63)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant maintained his Argentinian citizenship because the US permits it; and he also kept his foreign passport when he became a US citizen as 
he thought it was legal to do so.  He had been advised by a US immigration official that it was legal to keep and use his former passport.  
Immediately after he became a US citizen, he used his Argentinian passport in May 1999 for a personal celebration.  He was not then aware of 
any US prohibitions against doing so; and he thought use of his Argentinian passport to enter Greece would be safer because of unrest in that 
region.  On three or four other subsequent trips he only used his US passport.  He again thought it would be safer to use his Argentinian passport 
for a business trip to enter Columbia in April 2000; but he used his US passport to exit Columbia and to enter the US. (Exhibit 1; TR 31-40; 62, 
66) </P> 
 
<P>However, when he learned that were security issues with his maintaining dual citizenship, he immediate went to the Argentinian Consulate in August 
2001 to renounce his citizenship voluntarily and at the same time to relinquish his passport.  (Exhibits 1 &amp; 2; Exhibits C &amp; D; TR 31-37, 42)</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant  has no intention of returning to Argentina to live.  He had property in Argentina, but he sold it several years ago. (TR 31-37) He had an 
overseas bank account that he opened in the mid-1980's which he used as an investment tool; however, when he learned that there were security 
concerns over that account he closed it as he had only $150 in the account.  He has no intent of having a foreign bank account in the future.  
(Exhibit 2; Exhibit E; TR 43-46; 73)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's mother who is 84 and retired was born in Poland and immigrated first to Russia and then back to Poland, then to France and then to 
Argentina in 1948.  She has no association with the government in Argentina.   Applicant sends his mother $500 a month to subsidize her living 
expenses.  No one has ever tried to use his mother to influence him; and if anyone attempted to do so, he would report them to the appropriate 
governmental authorities.   He has visited his mother over a year ago and used to visit once or twice a year.  He talks to his mother weekly on the 
telephone.  Applicant also has a sister and brother in Argentina who also immigrated there in 1948; she is a housewife and not associated with the 
Argentinian government.  His brother is a certified public accountant (CPA) and is not associated with the Argentinian government.  He talks to his 
sister on the telephone more frequently than to his brother.  (Exhibit 2; TR 47-52, 63-64)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife was born in Argentina. She has three half-brothers in Argentina.  They send school support to one of them as her father died in 
1984; they send $300 per month or $3,600 per year.  Her brother has no connection with the government in Argentina.  They will continue to 
provide support for two more years until he finishes school. No one has ever tried to use this bother-in-law to influence Applicant; and if anyone 
attempted to do so, Applicant would report them to the appropriate governmental authorities. His sister's husband is an executive with an 
exporting business.  (Exhibit 2; TR 52-54, 62, 65-66, 67-77)</P> 
 
<P>His wife's mother was a citizen and resident of Argentina, but since September 2001 she received a US residence card and has lived with 
Applicant and his wife in the US and intends to become a US citizen.   (Exhibit 2; TR 54-55, 66-77)</P> 
 
<P>Given Applicant's clear commitment to report any attempt to influence him, any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his 
immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable as Argentina is a democratic government; and his family has no ties to the 
government.  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>References</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife (Ms. X) was born in Argentina and moved with her husband to several other countries in South America.  The family decided 
they preferred to live in the US in 1989 after transferred to the US for an assignment.  While living overseas again, she got her US residency in 
1992 which became effective in 1993 when they returned to the US.  She became a US naturalized citizen in May 1999 along with her husband 
and daughters.  They all voted in the last election.  Ms. X works in a nursery school. (Exhibits A &amp; B; TR 67-77)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's predecessor (Mr. Y) at Company #1 testified that he has known Applicant since the mid 1980's before he came to work for 
Company #1.  In fact Mr. Y played a role in recruiting Applicant to the company for a key position in the US, and the company sponsored him for 
his US residency.  Mr. Y worked closely with Applicant after he was hired and found him a very loyal subordinate and friend.  Although Applicant 
was reassigned to a job in a foreign subsidiary for two years, Mr. Y recommended that Applicant be brought back to work for him at Company 
#1 in 1993.  He worked with Applicant until July 1996 when Mr. Y joined another company and recommended Applicant to be his successor.  
They have remained close friends as their families live near each other. Mr. Y holds a security clearance in his current position.  He was previously 
unfamiliar with security concerns over use of dual passports and had advised Applicant to use his foreign passport on a personal trip for security 
reasons. (TR 79-93; 93-95)</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he

These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  
Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they 
make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1)   a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in

<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to

<P> to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue the clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an 
applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching 
the fair and impartial overall common sense determination, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a 
reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference     </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>If an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, this conduct raises a security concern 
under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, as the individual may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of 
the United States.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  (1)  the exercise of dual citizenship; (2)  
possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  Further, DoD policy clarification of August 16, 2000 explains that  "possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport" may be a disqualifying<A HREF="01-10306.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> condition and to mitigate an Applicant must surrender his foreign passport or  obtain official approval for 
its use.  Security concerns over Applicant's possible foreign preference arose from his active exercise of dual citizenship as he has maintained his 
citizenship in Argentina even after he became a naturalized US citizen in May 1999.  While dual citizenship is not prohibited <EM>per se (</EM>and in that 
sense is sanctioned by policies of the United States), any conduct indicating possible foreign preference does raise a security concern where such 
action would increase the risk of an individual being influenced by the needs, desires, or aims of a foreign nation.  Also, Applicant possessed a 
foreign passport and used it twice after became a naturalized citizen of the US and after his US passport was issued to him.  Applicant chose to do 
so for safety reasons and because he did not know that to do so would raise security concerns.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant meets one prong of the mitigation guidelines as under MC (1), his dual citizenship was based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a 
foreign country.  While there are no mitigating factors for an applicant's use of a foreign passport for safety reasons, to his credit Applicant 
voluntarily complied with DoD guidance soon after he became aware of proper avenue for individuals to take corrective avenue to mitigate this 
security concern: Applicant surrendered his foreign passport and voluntarily renounced his foreign citizenship in August 2001.  Not only did he 
maintain that his principal preference is for the US, but also he backed up his statements with actions and now falls within MC 4 as he not only 
expressed willingness to renounce his dual citizenship, he did so and fully complied with DoD policy guidance on passports.  </P> 
 
<P>While Applicant had a foreign bank account with a minimal balance, he closed it as soon as he learned that do so raised a security concern.  In this 
case, after reviewing all of the evidence in the record and considering all of the security policies, including  the August 16, 2000, policy clarification 
memorandum, I conclude he has met the DoD mitigation sufficiently to indicate his clear preference for the United States.  Security clearance 
decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's security eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances. 
<EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Acts indicative of foreign preference warrant careful scrutiny.  Hence, I decide 
SOR paragraph 1 and subparagraphs 1.a. through1.d. for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG>     </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government also expressed security concerns over Applicant's possible foreign influence raised by his close ties of affection to citizens of a 
foreign country: he has a mother and siblings in Argentina who are citizens there.   His mother-in-law is now a US resident and wants to become a 
US citizen.  Further his wife has three half brothers in Argentina.  Applicant and his wife provide $500 a month to his mother and $300 a month to 
help one of the wife's brothers who is in school  The security concern under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, is that a security risk may exist when 
an individual's immediate family. . . and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of 
the United States or (2)  may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security 
determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying include:  (1)  an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or 
obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country.  Applicant has relatively in frequent contacts with his family in Argentina with 
respect to visits there,  but has frequent telephone visits.</P> 
 
<P>Nevertheless, these security concerns are mitigated by the fact that Applicant's relatives  have no ties to their foreign government; nor is there any 
substantial likelihood that they would exercise foreign influence over Applicant. Merely because of these family ties Applicant is not vulnerable to 
duress.  Given his history of responsible conduct, I think it improbable that his any of his family members would create a situation that could result 
in the compromise of classified information simply because he sends subsidies to his elderly mother and a brother who is a student.  </P> 
 
<P>Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Given Applicant's clear commitment to report any attempt to influence him, 
any risk of foreign duress or influence on Applicant and/or his immediate family would appear to be slight and clearly manageable as Argentina is a 
democratic government; and his family has no ties to the government.  Security clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's 
security eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528-29 
(1988). Acts indicative of foreign influence warrant careful scrutiny.  After considering the Enclosure 2 Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, here I conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue pressure, so do not invoke such 
foreign influence concerns.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 2 and subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c. in Applicant's favor.</P>
