<P>Applicant has a history of criminal conduct. He failed to fully disclose the circumstances of his being fired from a job in 2001 and the related criminal conduct 
in a security clearance application he submitted in 2002 and in a statement he provided in 2003. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Applicant 
submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on February 25, 2005, admitted all SOR allegations except those contained in subparagraphs 3.a 
through 3.d, and requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on August 26, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on October 3, 2005, scheduling the hearing for October 26, 2005. The hearing 
was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted 20 documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-20, and admitted into the 
record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-5, and admitted into the 
record without objection. The record was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his case. Groups of 
documents pertaining to the six debts listed in the SOR were timely received, marked as AE 6-10, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript 
was received on November 9, 2005.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 31-year-old man who has been employed by a defense contractor since June 2002, presently as a preservation specialist. He was previously 
employed as an avionics installer outside the defense industry from March 2001 until June 2002, and was unemployed from January 2001 until March 2001. 
Before that he was employed as a sales manager in a retail store from August 1999 until January 2001, when he was terminated after he was caught stealing 
from his employer. Prior to that job, Applicant worked as a laborer from May 1999 until August 1999, a relief manager from January 1999 until May 1999, a 
helper from November 1998 until January 1999, and as a parts sales manager from September 1994 until November 1998. Applicant reported in a security 
clearance application (SF 86) he submitted in December 2002 that he left this last job by mutual agreement with his employer following allegations of 
misconduct on his part dealing with not wearing the required uniform.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant graduated from high school in 1993 and enlisted in the U. S. Air Force in March 1994. He attained the rank of senior airman (paygrade E-4), and was 
honorably discharged in March 1998.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was first married in August 1994, and divorced from that wife in April 1998. Although there were no children born of this marriage, Applicant has a 
12-year-old daughter from an earlier relationship for whom he pays child support in the amount of $137.00 per month. Applicant has been remarried since 
October 2000. He has two sons, ages five and six, and a stepson, age 15, from this marriage.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR lists six debts totaling approximately $18,600.00 that were either submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts. The debt listed in SOR 
subparagraph 1.a resulted from a deficit owing after an automobile was repossessed. Applicant submitted proof he has been making payments on this debt and 
that the balancing owing of $5,116.43 as of March 2004 had been reduced to $3,116.43 as of September 2005. (AE 8) Applicant submitted documentary 
evidence indicating he had negotiated a reduced settlement on the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b (AE 2), had made regular payments on the debt between 
July 2003 and August 2004, and had reduced the amount owing during that time from $7,650.00 to $5,890.00. (AE 7) The only documentary evidence of any 
payment having been made after August 2004 is of a $50.00 payment made in October 2004. (AE 4)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted proof he had negotiated a reduced settlement on the credit card debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.c, and has been making regular 
payments on this account since July 2004. (AE 6) The account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.d was satisfied in full as of February 25, 2005, by means of the 
government seizing a portion of an income tax refund owing to Applicant and applying it to payment of this debt. Applicant has paid the creditor listed in SOR 
subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f all but $70.00 of the total amount owing on those two debts plus two additional debts owing to that creditor that were not listed in the 
SOR.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of Disorderly Conduct-Fighting in November 1995, and was sentenced to six months unsupervised probation. The charge resulted 
from a pushing and shoving match Applicant engaged in with his ex-wife during the course of an argument. Although the arresting officer observed bruises on 
the ex-wife's arms, the more serious charge of Assault-Intent/Reckless/Injure was not referred for prosecution.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was notified by mail that he had issued a bad check in January 1998, and was required to report to the local police station. He did as directed and was 
required to pay a fine and attend a class, although it is unclear whether he ever actually appeared in court. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was accused of sexually molesting his three-year-old nephew in February 2000. The police conducted an investigation of the allegation after which 
the local prosecutor's office declined to issue a complaint. Applicant denies this allegation, and there is insufficient record evidence to substantiate it. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of Theft in February 2001, and placed on 12 months probation. He was also required to make restitution in the amount of $662.62, and 
to pay fines and court costs in the amount of $270.00. This conviction resulted from Applicant's actions in ringing up fraudulent refunds while employed in a 
retail store and stealing the money that was refunded. Applicant was also fired as a result of this criminal activity.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) in December 2002. The SF 86 was executed by Applicant subject to the criminal penalties imposed 
by 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 for knowingly and willfully  making false statements in that document. While he disclosed he had been fired from the employment that 
resulted in his theft conviction, he listed the reason for being fired as: "violation of company policy." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a sworn statement to a Special Agent (SA) from the Defense Security Service (DSS) on February 19, 2003, that was also made subject to 
the criminal penalties imposed by 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 for making knowing and willful false statements. In the statement, Applicant claimed he had refunded 
money to a friend who had returned some parts without providing all the required information, and that some of the information the friend provided was false. 
He claimed the reason he was fired was because it was determined he had been remiss in failing to have a manager approve the transaction. He then went on to 
assert he was charged with the theft because the loss prevention investigator was unable to contact the friend who had returned the merchandise.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant listed the theft charge in response to an SF 86 question inquiring about criminal offenses, but in the remarks section under that question stated: "I 
plea bargained because my witness did not show to court, so by plea bargaining I got a lesser charge and payed a fine. . . ." At the hearing of this case, Applicant 
provided the following testimony:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q Okay. Now let me ask you to flip the page and look at question 26. In question 26 it asks about your police record and other offenses. You indicated that, yes, 
you had an offense and it was the theft. Is this the thing the same theft that you were fired for from (name omitted)?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A It's the only theft on my record, yes.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q Okay. And you explained that in the remarks section that you plea bargained it because your witness did not show to court, is that right?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A Correct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q Now, is that the same witness that you mentioned in your statement to the Defense Security Service's agent that you falsified?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A Yes, that's correct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q So is this a falsified remark as well there?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A Yes, it was.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Q Okay. So you were providing false information about the fact you didn't want the Government to know in questions 20 or 26 about the theft, right?</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A No. I was trying to conceal my records because I knew my records are going to be pulled anyways.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In question 20 it asked had I ever been fired. I wrote yes, I wrote for violation of company - - violation of company policy. Theft is one of the company policies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under question 26 I wrote my theft down under being arrested and under the remarks I did not make a true statement. (Tr. pp. 32-34)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the SF 86, Applicant also failed to disclose he had been charged with Issuing a Bad Check and he failed to list all of his debts that were then more than 90 
days delinquent or that had been more than 180 days delinquent in the preceding seven years. His explanations that because of the way it was handled he did not 
consider the bad check charge to be an arrest, and he was following the instructions provided to him about what debts to list are credible.    </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
financial considerations, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access 
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="03-19060.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.  An</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an 
individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving 
responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant allowed a number of debts to become severely delinquent, submitted for collection, and/or charged off as bad debts. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>: and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply in this case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, Applicant has been making steady payments on most of his delinquent accounts and has significantly reduced the amount of his indebtedness. One 
account has been fully satisfied, two accounts have a very minimal balance owing, and two others are being satisfied by allotments taken directly from 
Applicant's pay. Applicant was making consistent payments on the one remaining account, although there is no evidence of any payment having been made 
since October 2004. Mitigating Condition (MC) 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>. 
Considering all the evidence in this case, Guideline F is decided for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of Disorderly Conduct in 1995, Issuing a Bad Check in 1998, and Theft in 2001. The record evidence does not support finding he 
sexually abused his nephew as was alleged in February 2000. In addition to the offenses Applicant has been convicted of, he also committed criminal offenses 
under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 when he knowing and wilfully provided false information in the SF 86 he submitted in December 2002, and in the statement he made to 
a SA from the DSS in February 2003. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>; and DC 2: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although the last offense Applicant committed, the falsification of the DSS statement, occurred over three years ago, his criminal conduct spanned a period of 
seven years with several years passing between the commission of each offense. Based on his repetitious pattern of criminal </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">conduct, I find MC 1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>: The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>; MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM> do not apply. The remaining mitigating conditions clearly have no applicability to the fact of this case. Guideline J is 
decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline E personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's explanations for why he did not list all his financial delinquencies and the bad check charge in the SF 86 he submitted are credible. However, the 
evidence clearly establishes he deliberately provided false and/or misleading information in the SF 86 concerning the reason he was fired in 2001, and the 
circumstances that led up to his theft conviction. He also deliberately provided false and/or misleading information in the statement he made to a SA from the 
DSS in February 2003 about the circumstances leading up to his employment termination and theft conviction.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and 
material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other representative in connection with a personnel security or 
trustworthiness determination</EM> apply. I have considered all mitigating conditions and none apply. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by his criminal and personal 
conduct. He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant a security clearance.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
