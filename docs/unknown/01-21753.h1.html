<P>Applicant's retention of her foreign passport after her naturalization as a U.S. citizen--an act demonstrating potential foreign preference--was mitigated where 
Applicant had retained the passport only because she had never been given any instructions that she should surrender it, had used the passport only twice since 
coming to the U.S. (and only once to go to her birth country), had not used the passport after becoming a U.S. citizen, and had surrendered it in accordance with 
the "Money Memo" once she became aware of its provisions. Applicant mitigated foreign influence concerns where all her close ties of affection were legal 
permanent residents of the U.S., and where record evidence demonstrated that family members had no connection with the foreign government and were not in 
a position to be exploited by the foreign government. Clearance granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 31 May 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 14 June 
2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 22 August 2002, and I received and set the case the same day. I 
issued a notice of hearing on 11 October 2002 for a hearing on 6 November 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   At the hearing, the Government presented two exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented four exhibits--also admitted 
without objection--and the testimony of three witnesses, including herself. DOHA received the transcript on 15 November 2002.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During the hearing, I utilized the services of Applicant's brother, who had already testified (Tr. 57-70), as an interpreter, subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 
&sect;1001 (Tr. 73-74), to get the clearest possible record of the father's testimony. Neither party recorded an objection to this procedure (Tr. 72-73).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. She has not previously held a clearance. She graduated 
from a local high school in 1994  and has taken some college courses at the local community college (Tr. 23).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father, a native El Salvadoran, emigrated to the U.S. approximately 21 years ago.<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He left a job as an administrative assistant in a bank and found 
work in the U.S. as a construction worker. He has resided continually in the U.S. since 1981, although he has traveled back to El Salvador 8-10 times in the last 
ten years to visit his now-94-year-old father. He sends his father about $100.00 per month financial support. He had no connections to the government of El 
Salvador when he lived there, and has none now that he lives in the U.S. He does not participate in any El Salvadoran community groups. He asserts that he has 
no friends who are not U.S. citizens.<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He is a legal permanent resident of the U.S.; he would like to become a citizen, but his English is not good enough for 
him to pass the citizenship test, which is given only in English (G.E. 1; Tr. 30, 75-82).<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In approximately 1984, Applicant's mother followed her husband to the U.S. In El Salvador, she was a cook in a restaurant; in the U.S. she is employed as a 
cook (government contractor) in a government building housing a federal agency. She has resided continually in the U.S. after emigrating here, although she has 
traveled back to El Salvador a few times to visit relatives there. She had no connections to the government of El Salvador when he lived there, and has none 
now that she lives in the U.S. She does not participate in El Salvadoran community groups. Applicant and her brother testified that their mother has no friends 
who are not U.S. citizens.<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> She is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. Like her husband, she would like to become a U.S. citizen, but although her English is 
better than her husband's, the citizenship test is a formidable hurdle for her (G.E. 1; Tr. 25, 29, 64).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In approximately 1986--when she was 12 years old--Applicant and her brother (who is five and a half years younger than Applicant) emigrated to the U.S. 
from El Salvador, where they resided with relatives while their parents got established in the U.S. (Tr. 52). Applicant completed her schooling in the U.S. 
graduating from high school in 1994. She has since taken some college courses at the local community college (G.E. 1; Tr.23). She has resided continually with 
her parents in the U.S. after emigrating here, although she took a post-high school pleasure trip to Canada in 1994<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, and traveled to El Salvador once in 1999 to 
visit her grandfather. She had no connections to the government of El Salvador when she lived there, and has none now that she lives in the U.S. She had no 
financial interests or assets in El Salvador (Tr. 41). She does not participate in El Salvadoran community groups. She has no friends who are not legal 
permanent residents of the U.S. (Tr. 33-36).<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> She applied for U.S. citizenship before making her one trip to El Salvador. While in El Salvador visiting her 
grandfather in 1999, Applicant received notification to return to the U.S. to  take the citizenship test (Tr. 47-48). She became a naturalized U.S. citizen on 16 
August 1999 (G.E. 1). She has a U.S. passport issued in July 2002 (G.E. 1; Tr. 44).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother lives in another state, where he is employed in an airline credit union. He has resided continually in the U.S. since emigrating in 
approximately 1986. He has not been back to El Salvador except for a trip in July 1989 to obtain his "green card" (Tr. 59). He speaks English more fluently 
than his sister, with virtually no accent. He had no connections to the government of El Salvador when he lived there (he was seven or so when he left), and 
none now that he lives in the U.S. He has no financial interests in El Salvador. He does not participate in El Salvadoran community groups. He is a legal 
permanent resident of the U.S. He intends to apply for U.S. citizenship, but is waiting until he has the answers to the citizenship test down cold and $5,000.00 
in savings in case he encounters hurdles which require legal representation. He has frequent telephone contact with Applicant, and sees her--and his 
parents--often because his job comes with an inexpensive airfare benefit (Tr. 57-70).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a boyfriend who is a citizen of El Salvador and a legal permanent resident of the U.S. (Tr. 31). He works as a sprinkler installer. He want to 
become a U.S. citizen, and Applicant is pushing him toward this goal (Tr. 32) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant became a U.S. citizen, she possessed an El Salvadoran passport issued on 21 June 1999 (when Applicant was not yet a U.S. citizen). This 
passport would  not expire until 21 June 2004. Applicant used this passport to travel to El Salvador in June 1999.<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> She did not use it after becoming a U.S. 
citizen. When Applicant received the SOR, she contacted the El Salvador Embassy to surrender the passport, but was told she would have to keep it until it 
expired (Tr. 25-26. However, once she retained counsel, she took steps to surrender the passport (A.E. A.-D.; Tr. 25-26, 50).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 25 June 2001, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86) (G.E. 1) on which truthfully disclosed her foreign connections and travel. 
She indicated that she did not consider herself a dual citizen of another country (question 3). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has lived at the same address with her parents since November 1988 (G.E. 1; Tr. 22-23, 36). The record contains no evidence of Applicant's work 
performance or character references. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A3.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum(the "Money 
emo") to clarify the application of Guideline C., Foreign Preference, to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport. In pertinent part, the 
ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum <STRONG>"requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official 
approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."</STRONG>(Emphasis added).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant possessed an El Salvadoran passport after her naturalization in 1999, she has not exercised dual citizenship with El Salvador. Applicant 
indicated on her SCA that she did not consider herself a dual citizen. While her U.S. citizenship oath may not operate to terminate her El Salvadoran citizenship 
under El Salvadoran law, her foreign citizenship possesses little security significance if based solely on her birth in a foreign country. For Applicant's conduct to 
fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, Foreign Preference, she must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United 
States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access under 
Guideline C. The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring those entrusted with this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the 
foreign country of which they may also be a citizen. Under this assessment, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline C. 
Nevertheless, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant convincingly demonstrates that she prefers her U.S. citizenship. The single instance of conduct to the contrary--retaining her El Salvadoran passport 
after becoming a U.S. citizen--is mitigated by a number of factors. First, there is no record evidence to indicate she had any reason to know that she should 
dispose of it. Second, she appears to have used her El Salvdoran passport only twice since coming to the U.S.: once on a pleasure trip to Canada and once to 
travel back to El Salvador. In both instances, she was required to use her El Salvadoran passport because she was not yet eligible for a U.S. passport. Third, she 
never used the passport after her naturalization. Finally, when she became aware of the requirements of the "Money Memo,"she first tried to surrender the 
passport herself, but was rebuffed by embassy staff. She later surrendered the passport to the El Salvador Embassy through counsel.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has resided in the U.S. since she was 12 years old and completed significant portions of her education in the U.S. Her entire family, except for her 94-year-old grandfather, lives in the U.S. She has no ties to El Salvador. Her national preference seems overwhelmingly for the U.S. Accordingly, I resolve 
Guideline C. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a similar fashion, the Government has perhaps established its case under Guideline B.,<A HREF="01-21753.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> but I consider the security concerns mitigated. Applicant's family 
story is the paradigm of the latter 20<SUP>th</SUP> century immigrant tale. Applicant's father fled his homeland, a country torn by civil war, and brought his family with him 
when he was able. Whether he and his wife ever become citizens of the U.S., it is clear that they are never going back to El Salvador. Their legal permanent 
resident status ensures that they will never have to go back to El Salvador, barring some severe criminal activity. They had no connection to the El Salvador 
government then, none now. Applicant has lived with her parents since emigrating to the U.S., like every major immigrant group of the last two centuries, and 
especially the Hispanic immigrants from Latin America during the latter part of the 20<SUP>th</SUP> century. There is no inherent security significance in these living 
arrangements. Her younger brother was the first to leave home for a greater economic opportunity in a different state. It is difficult to even articulate how 
Applicant could be subject to foreign influence under these circumstances, when the parents are clearly not agents of El Salvador nor positioned to be exploited 
by the government of El Salvador. In a similar fashion, Applicant's brother and boyfriend are most unlikely pressure points. Both safely, and permanently, 
resident in the U.S., it is nearly impossible to imagine a situation where Applicant would be forced to chose between her duty to her brother and her boyfriend 
(if any) and her duty to the U.S. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline B. for Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated  2 January 1992--amended by Change 3 dated 16 
February 1996 and by Change 4 dated 20 April 1999 (Directive). 
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>Or about 1981. I take official notice, <EM>sua sponte</EM>, that civil war was waged from 1979 until 1991 in El Salvador as the country struggled to transition from 
military to civilian rule (<EM>See,</EM> www.state.gov). 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>An assertion which is not likely to be strictly true given his ethnic background and the construction industry he is employed in. More likely, he has no friends 
who are not legal aliens residing in the U.S. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>During the hearing, I utilized the services of Applicant's brother, who had already testified (Tr. 57-70) as an interpreter, subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 
&sect;1001 (Tr. 73-74), to get the clearest possible record of the father's testimony. Neither party recorded an objection to this procedure (Tr. 72-73). 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>Again, an assertion which is not likely to be strictly true given her ethnic background. More likely, she has no friends who are not legal aliens residing in the 
U.S. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A>For which she used an earlier El Salvadoran passport (Tr. 27, 44-46) 
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A>Department Counsel put the question to Applicant as friends who are not U.S. citizens. However, the SOR clearly states, and Applicant admits, family 
contacts and a boyfriend who are legal permanent residents of the U.S., and thus obviously not citizens. 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A>There is a discrepancy in dates between Applicant's testimony and record copies of her passport (G.E. 2, A.E. B). Applicant testified (Tr. 27, 41) that she 
went to El Salvador in 1999 for two weeks to see her grandfather. The record copies of the passport clearly shows that it was issued on 21 June 1999, although 
they do not show where the passport was issued. The passport copies contain only two entries: one is a completely illegible stamp that is presumably her entry 
into El Salvador. The other, clearly legible, entry is her return to the U.S. on 26 June 1999 through U.S. Immigration in Washington, DC. Consequently, either 
her trip was only for five days in June 1999, or she had to renew her passport while in El Salvador. In any event, her return to the U.S. in June 1999--before her 
naturalization--is clearly established, and there is no evidence of foreign passport use after her naturalization. 
<P><A NAME="N_9_">9. </A>A literal reading of the disqualifying factors establishes that the foreign citizenship of Applicant's family members and boyfriend, standing alone, raises a 
security concern. However, the entire guideline is qualified with language which states that these conditions <EM>may </EM>raise a security risk or be disqualifying. A 
common sense analysis of this case could easily support a conclusion that the foreign influence case against Applicant has not been established.
