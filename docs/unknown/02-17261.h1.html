<P>Applicant was convicted on three separate occasions of driving while impaired because of alcohol consumption.  Applicant deliberately falsified his security 
clearance application by denying he had ever been convicted of any alcohol-related offenses.  Applicant failed to mitigate the alcohol consumption, personal 
conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 24 July 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="02-17261.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 20 August 2003 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 22 December 2003.  On 23 February 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 2 March 
2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is a 46-year-old firearms instructor for a defense contractor.  He served 23 years in the U.S. Marine Corps, retiring at the grade of E-8.  Ex. 1 at 1-3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant began drinking alcoholic beverages in approximately 1975, when he was a 19-year-old marine.  Tr. 13.  In 1977, Applicant was arrested for driving 
while intoxicated (DWI).  He spent 14-16 hours in jail before being released.  As a result of the DWI, applicant was fined $300 and had his driver's license 
revoked for six months.  Applicant noted this arrest on a security clearance application (SCA) he completed in August 1985 while he was in the Marine Corps.  
Ex. 3 at 2, 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In August 1994, applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).  He pled guilty to the charge, was fined, and was ordered to pay court 
costs.  Applicant's driver's license was restricted and he was ordered to complete an alcohol safety awareness program that required him to attend 12 weekly 
sessions of out-patient counseling and to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.  One year later, after Applicant successfully completed the terms of his 
sentence, the restrictions were removed from his driver's license.  Ex. 5 at 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On 31 December 1999, applicant was arrested for DUI on his way to a New year's eve party.  In April 2000, he pled guilty to DUI, was fined, ordered to pay 
court costs, and issued a restricted driver's license for one year.  The court also required Applicant to complete an alcohol safety awareness program that 
included 12 weekly sessions of counseling and attendance at AA meetings.  The restrictions were removed from Applicant's driving privileges after he 
successfully completed the terms of his sentence.  Ex. 5 at 2.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On 30 May 2001, Applicant completed another SCA in which he certified the contents were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief, 
and acknowledged that any knowing and willful false statements violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Question 24 of the SCA asked if Applicant had <EM>ever</EM> been charged 
with or convicted of any alcohol-related offenses.  Applicant answered "no."  Ex. 1 at 5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">After he was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent concerning his SCA, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement, dated 15 March 2002, 
in which he admitted the 1994 and 1999 DUI arrests and convictions.  Ex. 5.  On 3 April 2003, DOHA issued interrogatories concerning Applicant's use of 
alcohol.  Question 5 asked if Applicant had been arrested, charged, or held by any law enforcement agencies for any reason.  On 11 April 2003, Applicant 
answered "yes" to question 5, but listed only the 1999 incident.  Applicant claimed the "incident was an isolated and stupid mistake."  Ex. 4 at 5.  He admitted 
consuming alcoholic beverages a week prior, on 4 April 2003, but stated he did not intend to drink alcoholic beverages in the future.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 3.  Applicant 
apparently continued to consume alcoholic beverages until he received the SOR at the end of July 2003.  Tr. 15, 24.  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline G--Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication at times from 1977 to April 2003 (&para; 1.a.), was arrested and convicted of 
DUI in 1999 and 1994 (&para; 1.b., 1.c.), was arrested for DWI in 1977 (&para; 1.d.), and continues to consume alcohol (&para; 1.e.).  Excessive alcohol consumption often 
leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information due to carelessness.  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant was involved in three alcohol-related incidents of driving while 
his faculties were impaired by alcohol.  DC E2.A6.1.2.1.  Applicant claims not to have had consumed any alcoholic beverages since August 2003 when he 
received the SOR.  He called it a "sanity check."  Tr. 24.  By discontinuing his use of alcohol, Applicant has made positive changes in his behavior supportive 
of sobriety.  MC E2.A7.1.3.3.  But 20 years, three alcohol-related incidents, having his driving privileges restricted three times, and completing alcohol 
counseling twice failed to convince him he had an alcohol problem.  Apparently even being interviewed by a DSS agent and later having to complete 
interrogatories about his alcohol consumption did not get his attention.  It took the SOR to get him to see the light.  His decision to stop drinking is 
commendable.  However, sufficient time for Applicant to establish a favorable track record of sobriety has not elapsed.  I find against Applicant, except for &para; 
1.e.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material facts on his SCA by denying he had been arrested or convicted of any alcohol-related 
offenses (&para; 2.a.).  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material facts in his SCA by 
denying his arrests and convictions for alcohol-related offenses.  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  After reviewing all of the evidence in this case, I conclude Applicant's 
testimony denying he intentionally omitted the alcohol-related arrests from his SCA is just not credible.  It contradicts his Answer to the SOR.  Furthermore, his 
failure to correctly account for all three incidents in his statement to the DSS agent (Ex. 5) and his interrogatories (Ex. 4), after he should have known how 
seriously the government took this issue, demonstrates Applicant's lack of reliability and credibility.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline J--Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested three times for driving while his faculties were impaired by alcohol (&para; 3.a.) and Applicant's deliberate falsification of his 
SCA constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the 
executive branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the 
Government of the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM> at 484 U.S. at 527.  After considering all the evidence, I am convinced Applicant deliberately falsified his answer 
to question 24 on his SCA. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he was convicted of multiple lesser offenses (driving while impaired) and 
committed a single serious offense (intentionally providing false information on his SCA).  DC E2.A10.1.2.2.  None of the listed mitigating conditions under 
the guideline apply.  I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
