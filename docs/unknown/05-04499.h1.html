<P>Applicant, a then post office employee, was convicted in March 2001 of converting postal funds to her own use. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 20, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted a response to the SOR that was 
received by DOHA on November 4, 2005. She admitted all allegations and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on January, 23, 2006, that was mailed to Applicant on January 24, 2006. Applicant 
acknowledged receipt of the FORM on February 15, 2006. She thereafter did not object to anything contained in the FORM or submit additional information 
for consideration within the 30-day period provided to her. The case was assigned to me April 10, 2006.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. Additionally, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of 
fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 43-year-old woman who has been employed by a defense contractor as a preservation technician since March 2001.  She was previously 
employed by the United States Postal Service from July 1992 until she resigned in May 2000. She was unemployed from May 2000 until November 2000, 
employed as a mail handler from November 2000 until December 2000, and unemployed again from December 2000 until March 2001. Applicant has been 
married since January 1992.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While employed by the Postal Service, apparently in a supervisory capacity,<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> between May 1999 and May 2000, Applicant converted $737.84 in postal stamp 
credits to her own use. Although the file contains very little information about the conversion, it appears Applicant on multiple occasions took cash from her 
drawer that she had received in payment for postage sold to customers.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Her thievery was discovered during the course of an inventory conducted on May 25, 
2000. Applicant admitted she stole the money to pay her personal expenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On November 6, 2000, Applicant was charged with misappropriating $1,000 or less of postal funds in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1711. 
She pled guilty to that offense on  March 9, 2001, and was placed on two years probation. She was ordered to serve 120 days home confinement and pay a $500 
fine as terms of her probation. Applicant complied with all terms of her probation and was discharged therefrom on June 24, 2002.     </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline E, 
pertaining to personal conduct, and Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, with their  respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant violated the trust placed in her by the Postal Service when she stole money from her work place to pay her personal expenses. Disqualifying 
Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>; and DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal 
conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if 
known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM> apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Once the government established a case against Applicant through her admissions and the evidence contained in the FORM, the burden shifted to her to present 
evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against her. To meet her burden, Applicant provided a letter accompanying her 
SOR response in which she stated she regretted her actions and that she is a responsible individual who has changed. She did not submit any evidence in 
support of her self-serving assertions. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Mitigating evidence that can be gleaned from the FORM includes: Applicant successfully completed her sentence of probation, she has been gainfully 
employed since March 2001, she has been married since January 1992, she has maintained a steady residence since at least June 1995, she openly disclosed her 
conviction in the SF 86 she submitted in May 2001, and she has apparently not committed any criminal conduct since May 2000.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's plea of guilty and successful completion of probation entitle her to application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual has taken positive 
steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM> to her case. However, considering the serious breach of trust 
evidenced by her multiple larcenous acts committed between May 1999 and May 2000, her failure to even attempt to explain why she engaged in such 
misconduct, and her failure to present any evidence in support of her claim that she is a changed person, I find she has failed to meet her burden of mitigating 
the personal conduct concerns that exist in this case. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.      </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual 
may be inclined to break rules.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of and sentenced for stealing money from the U.S. Postal Service. Although she was only charged with a misdemeanor, her conduct 
consisted of multiple individual thefts, spanned a one-year period of time, and exhibited an extreme breach of trust. For those reasons, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious 
crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM> applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Although Applicant was convicted of a single offense, her criminal conduct was a continuing offense covering a one-year period of time during which she 
obviously stole money from the Postal Service on multiple occasions. Accordingly, she is not entitled to application of MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The crime was an isolated 
incident</EM>. She failed to provide any information to explain why she engaged in criminal activity, to support her claim that she is a changed person, or to 
supplement what little mitigating evidence can be found in the record to show that she is rehabilitated and/or that her criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. 
Thus, she is not entitled to application of MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that 
person's life</EM>; MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>; or MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM> to her case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's last criminal act occurred in May 2000. MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM> applies. However, again considering the serious breach of trust 
evidenced by her larcenous conduct, her failure to explain why she engaged in such misconduct, and her failure to present any evidence in support of her claim 
that she is a changed person, I find this loan mitigating condition insufficient to mitigate her criminal conduct. Guideline J is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Once again, it must be noted that no one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> 
and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="05-04499.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> After considering the 
evidence of record in this case, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern caused by her personal and criminal conduct.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P>
