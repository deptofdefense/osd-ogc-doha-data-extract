<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On December 23, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a Security Clearance Application <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SF 86).<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </SPAN> On June 28, 2006, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could 
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  </P> 
 
<P>In an answer notarized on July 24, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and asked for a hearing.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The case was assigned to me on October 26, 
2006.  On November 13, 2006, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling the hearing on November 30, 2006.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  
The government submitted two documentary exhibits that were admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 without objection.  I took administrative notice 
of nine additional documents offered by the government as discussed, <EM>infra.  </EM>The Applicant testified and submitted nine documents that were admitted as 
Appellant Exhibits (AE) A through I without objection.  Applicant submitted one additional document post-hearing that was admitted as AE J without 
objection.  DOHA received the transcript on December 13, 2006.    </P>

<P>Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 
2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); <EM>McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service</EM>, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 
1986)).  The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or taken from government reports. 
<EM>See</EM> Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender &amp; Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  Applicant did not object to my 
consideration of Exs. I to IX for purposes of administrative notice. Tr. 15-33. </P> 
 
<P>At the conclusion of the evidence, the government moved to amend &para; 2.b. by deleting the word "cousins" and substituting the words "siblings-in-law" to 
conform with the evidence.  Without objection from Applicant, I granted the government's motion to amend.  Tr. 89-90.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations, Applicant admitted the underlying facts alleged in the SOR &para;&para; 1.a. through 1.c.  She admitted, in part, and clarified allegations in &para; 
2. In &para; 2.a., DOHA alleged her parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Israel.  In her answer to the SOR, she admitted her parents-in-law were citizens and 
residents of Israel, but are now deceased.  In &para; 2.b., DOHA alleged she had six cousins who were citizens and residents of Israel.  In her answer to the SOR, 
Applicant denied having six cousins who were citizens and residents of Israel, but did admit to having six siblings-in-law who were citizens and residents of 
Israel.  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact, and her clarifying remarks about security concerns will be discussed in further detail, <EM>infra</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is employed as an advisory software engineer for a government contractor, and has been employed by her company with a constructive start date of 
September 1982.  Tr. 44-45, AE F.  Her manager requested her to apply for a security clearance because one of the projects in her group, which was originally 
designed/developed for commercial application, is also applicable in the military environment.  Since Applicant is the project leader, her manager requested that 
she apply for a security clearance should her company be awarded a contract with application to the military. Having a security clearance would also provide 
Applicant opportunities to work on "interesting and challenging" projects and also provide her with upward mobility.  She is a first-time applicant for a security 
clearance. Tr. 74-75, AE J.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 48 years old.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  She was born and raised in the U.S. near a major metropolitan area.  She attended a state university, majoring in mathematics, and 
had a dual minor in Judaic  studies and computer science.  She was awarded a bachelor of arts degree in May 1979.  While employed full-time, she enrolled in 
graduate school in September 1982 at a private university and was awarded a master's degree in computer science in May 1987.  Tr. 43-44.</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant was in college, she spent her senior year in Israel in a study abroad program.  While in Israel, she met and married her husband, an Israeli 
citizen, in April 1979.  After marrying her husband, Applicant became an Israeli citizen in "1979 or 1980."  Tr. 52.  After getting married, Applicant and her 
husband remained in Israel.  In June 1981, her oldest son was born, and he is a dual citizen of Israel and the U.S.  In December 1981, Applicant and her young 
son returned to the U.S. and were later joined by her husband in January 1982.  In addition to having a now 25-year-old son, she also had two other children 
after returning to the U.S.,  a 22-year-old son, and a 17-year-old daughter.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's oldest son is a graduate student attending an Ivy League university studying applied physics, her second son is attending a state university, majoring 
in mathematics, and her daughter is a high school senior living at home and plans to study marine biology/ecology.  AE C.  Applicant stated all of her children 
have been raised to be honest, moral, and ethical in all of their interpersonal and business relationships.  Her oldest son volunteers as a "Big Brother" mentoring 
Hispanic children in a major metropolitan area.  Her second son works with the open source community and donates blood on a regular basis.  Her daughter 
volunteers at the food pantry at  the local Jewish Community Center and helps coordinate children's events at their synagogue.  AE C.</P> 
 
<P>After Applicant's husband immigrated to the U.S. in January 1982, he became a U.S. citizen in December 1985.  He is employed as a supervisor in the 
Department of Probation in a major metropolitan area and holds a clearance from the Department of Homeland Security.  Tr. 78-79. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant holds a valid U.S. passport issued in December 1999.  She previously held an Israeli passport, which she had renewed in November 1995 and which 
expired in October 2005.  In the 25 years since Applicant returned to the U.S., she has only been to Israel four times, most recently in January/February 2000.  
The purpose of her most recent visit to Israel was to visit her son who was studying there between high school and college.  During her visits to Israel she used 
her then valid Israeli passport when entering and departing Israel as required by Israeli law.  Conversely, she used her U.S. passport when exiting and returning 
to the U.S. GE 2, Tr. 64-66. Applicant stated that, if traveling to Israel required her to renew her Israeli passport, she would not travel to Israel.  Tr. 72.  </P> 
 
<P>As indicated, <EM>supra, </EM>the SOR alleged Applicant had six cousins, who are citizens and residents of Israel.  As Applicant clarified in her answer to the SOR, those 
relatives are not cousins, but siblings-in-law.  The first sibling-in-law is an unmarried woman, who works as a nursing assistant in a hostel for people with 
mental disabilities.  Tr. 56-57.  The second sibling-in-law is a married man who is a retired stock clerk from a soft drink company and receives a pension from 
the Israeli government.  Tr. 57-58.  The third sibling-in-law is a man who works for a state owned aircraft company as a research engineer.  Tr. 58-59.  The 
fourth sibling-in-law is a married woman who is a stay at home mother/homemaker.  Tr. 59.  The fifth sibling-in-law is a divorced woman who is a salesperson 
for a pharmacy.  Tr. 60.  The sixth sibling-in-law is a man who works as a medical technician for a hospital and also drives an ambulance.  Tr. 60, AE C.  </P> 
 
<P>The extent of Applicant's contact with her siblings-in-law is vicariously through her husband's telephone calls with five of his siblings before holidays, and 
occasional telephone calls back and forth.  Tr. 61-64, 70-71.  Applicant is not close with any of her husband's siblings.  Tr. 84-85.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant derives no benefit by retaining her Israeli citizenship.  Applicant further stated she would be willing to renounce her Israeli citizenship.  Tr. 78.  She 
described her dual citizenship as an "abstract emotional tie."  She cited sufferings of the Jewish people and in particular family members who perished because 
of their heritage as a rationale for having maintained dual citizenship.  Tr. 94-95.  </P> 
 
<P>Neither Applicant nor her husband own any real or personal property in Israel.  All of their real and personal property is in the U.S., which includes a home and 
automobiles.  Applicant conducts all her banking in the U.S.  She exercises her right to vote in the U.S. and enjoys all other privileges of being a U.S. citizen 
only.  Tr. 81-82.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant provided two work-related reference letters from supervisory company officials describing her work performance as outstanding.  The letters 
emphasized she is a conscientious and trustworthy employee.  AE A and B.  She also submitted a certificate of merit from her local community as well as a 
citation from her State Assembly recognizing her as an "outstanding citizen."  Tr. 79-81, AE D and F.  She submitted performance appraisals for the last three 
years, all of which reflected above average performance.  These appraisals document in great detail the tremendous contributions Applicant has made over the 
years and her potential for future service.  They also make it clear Applicant is a trusted and valued employee.  AE F through I.  Applicant is deeply vested in 
the U.S., is honest, and stated she would never betray the trust of the U.S.  Tr. 95.  </P>

<P>In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative 
guidelines. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should 
apply these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An 
administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a 
number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</P> 
 
<P>Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to the relevant 
adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN>  Since the protection of the national security is the paramount 
consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence."<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to 
establish a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the 
burden shifts to the applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting 
witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  
<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).</SPAN><A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of 
Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, 
loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline C, a security concern may exist when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, 
then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive E2.A3.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 1.  <EM>The exercise of dual citizenship; </EM>and FP DC 2: <EM>Possession and/or use of a foreign passport</EM>; are acts 
that demonstrate a foreign preference.  Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Israel, and she exercised her Israeli citizenship by obtaining and using an 
Israeli passport to enter Israel after she became a U.S. citizen.  However, she obtained and used an Israeli passport only because of the Israeli legal requirement 
that mandates the use of an Israeli passport by Israeli citizens to enter and exit Israel.  The purpose of these visits to Israel was to visit in-laws and, more 
recently, her son when he was studying in Israel in 2005.</P> 
 
<P>In addition to her Israeli passport, Applicant presented her U.S. passport to customs officials in connection with her four trips to Israel over the past 25 years, 
so those trips would be properly made known and documented by U.S. officials.  Applicant's Israeli passport expired in September 2005 and contrary to what 
is alleged in the SOR, Applicant does not plan to renew her Israeli passport.</P> 
 
<P>The government did not allege possession of a valid Israeli passport.  She has not returned to Israel since her Israeli passport expired and maintains a current 
U.S. passport.  The Memorandum of Assistant Secretary of Defense Arthur L. Money, dated August 16, 2000 hereinafter "ASDC3I memorandum" mandates 
that, "consistent application of the guideline requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains 
official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."</P> 
 
<P>The Appeal Board has indicated in ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) that the ASDC3I memorandum requirement to surrender a 
passport also applied to expired passports.  Moreover, the passport cannot be surrendered to a Department of Defense security officer, it must be surrendered 
to the issuing authority.  ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005).  </P> 
 
<P>There is no allegation concerning the failure to surrender the Israeli passport under Guideline C (foreign preference) in this case.  "[T]here is no question that 
Applicant was entitled to receive reasonable notice of the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke [her] access to classified information, as well as a 
reasonable opportunity to respond."  ISCR Case No. 03-06174 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2005) (citations omitted).  </P> 
 
<P>Since Applicant's SOR was issued, revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) 
(hereinafter "Revised Guidelines") took effect on September 2, 2006.  Under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the Revised Guidelines, paragraph 10(a)(1) 
the first disqualifying condition states, "possession of a <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">current</SPAN> foreign passport (emphasis added)," effectively overruling the Appeal Board's expansive 
interpretation of the ASDC3I memorandum as applicable to expired passports.  The President's approval of revised adjudicative guidelines was forwarded in a 
emorandum from the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs to the Director, Information Security Oversight Office on December 29, 2005.  
This memorandum asked the Director to, "[p]lease circulate the revised guidelines to all affected agencies for immediate implementation."</P> 
 
<P>The revised guidelines were implemented within DoD by an Under Secretary of Defense Memorandum dated August 30, 2006.  This Memorandum makes the 
revised Guidelines applicable to all adjudications and other determinations in which an SOR is issued after September 1, 2006, and requires that all SORs 
issued prior to September 1, 2006 be adjudicated under the previous Guidelines.  Applicant's case must be adjudicated under the previous Guidelines because 
on June 28, 2006, Applicant's SOR was issued.  ISCR Case No. 03-17839 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2006) (White, J. separate opinion)(explaining purpose for 
delayed implementation is to ensure applicant's have notice of particular guidelines in effect at the time the SOR is issued).  However, assuming the Revised 
Guidelines improve and support national security objectives, and an Applicant is not prejudiced by the change, an Applicant should be able to urge the DoD to 
apply the Revised Guidelines, when they are not inconsistent with the previous Guidelines, or when they clarify application of the Guidelines.  I conclude that 
the ASDC3I memorandum does not bar Applicant's clearance because of her possession of an expired Israeli passport.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant acquired her Israeli citizenship as a young woman in conjunction with marrying her Israeli husband and living with him in Israel for a short time 25 
years ago.  At such a young age, she could not have foreseen this action would have lead to such complications later in her life.  In this case, Applicant 
expressed a willingness to renounce to Israeli citizenship and is able to invoke Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) 4: <EM>Individual has expressed a 
willingness to renounce dual citizenship</EM>.  The facts of this case do not support application of other FP MCs under this concern.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Under Guideline B, </SPAN>a "security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure."  Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>This allegation is tenuous based on the fact Applicant has six siblings-in-law living in Israel with whom she has limited contact, and such contact in large part is 
maintained vicariously through her husband.  SOR &para; 2.a. alleged Applicant's parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Israel.  This concern is no longer valid 
because both her parents-in-law are deceased. Two of eight possible foreign influence disqualifying conditions (FI DC) could raise a security concern in this 
case.  FI DC 1 applies where an "immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country." Directive &para; <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1.</SPAN> "Immediate family members" include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, 
and sisters.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1. Although Applicant's siblings-in-law are not "immediate family members" as defined by the Directive, they can be said to 
be individuals with whom she has "close ties of affection or obligation."  The government produced evidence to establish FI DC 1 because Applicant's siblings-in-law are Israeli citizens, and they currently live in Israel.  FI DC 3 applies where an applicant has, "relatives, cohabitatants, or associates who are connected 
with any foreign government." Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.   FI DC 3 is applicable because her second sibling-in-law is retired and receiving a pension from the 
government of Israel.  </P> 
 
<P>Although, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B, if only one 
relative lives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and 
could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006);<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN>ISCR Case No. 99-0424

<P>Security concerns based on foreign influence can be mitigated by showing the applicability of one or more foreign influence mitigating conditions (FI MC).  FI 
C 1 recognizes that security concerns are reduced when there is "[a] determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  Notwithstanding the 
facially disjunctive language of FI MC 1, the Appeal Board has decided that Applicant must prove that his family members, cohabitant or associates are not 
agents of a foreign power, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">and</SPAN> are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to chose between the person(s) 
involved and the United States.  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. July 26, 2004).  Applicant satisfies the first prong of FI MC 1 even under the Appeal 
Board's very broad definition of "agent of a foreign power."<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Also, the Appeal Board has specifically indicated that receipt of a foreign pension does not 
cause a person to be an agent of a foreign power.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>The second prong of FI MC 1 provides that it is potentially mitigating where the "associate(s) in question are not . . . in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States." The Appeal Board interprets this 
language as establishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant must affirmatively prove that there is <EM>no possibility </EM>that anyone might attempt to exploit or 
influence a foreign relative or acquaintance in the future. <EM> See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) ("[FI MC] 1 does not apply because, as 
is well settled, it requires that Applicant demonstrate that his relatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to them 
and his loyalty to the United States."); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005).  </P> 
 
<P>The nature of a Israel's government, its competitive relationship with the United States, its history of espionage against the United States, and the prevalence of 
terrorism are all relevant in assessing the likelihood that Applicant's family members are vulnerable to coercion, persuasion, or duress.  As indicated <EM>infra</EM>,<EM> 
</EM>Israel has a complicated relationship to the U.S.  The Appeal "Board has warned 'against reliance on overly simplistic distinctions between 'friendly' nations 
and 'hostile' nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.'"<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  In any event, Applicant should not be placed into a position where she may be forced to 
choose between loyalty to the United States and her siblings-in-law living in Israel.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  Additionally, a foreign government could bring pressure on her by 
terminating her sibling-in-law's pension.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-06267 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 24, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-30535 at 4 (App. Bd. May 4, 2005).  
Thus, FI MC 1<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> cannot be applied.  </P> 
 
<P>FI MC 3 can mitigate security concerns where "contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  
Applicant's contacts are limited to occasional telephone contact, but more accurately her contact is vicariously maintained through her husband's telephone 
calls back and forth to family members in Israel.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to establish that her contacts with her siblings-in-law are casual under the definition established by the Appeal Board.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 
04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007).   The term "casual" means a contact that is "more fortuitous in nature than planned or designed" or "resulting from, or 
occurring by chance."  ISCR Case No. 04-08870 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006).  Arguably this definition of "casual" is inconsistent with the Directive, as 
it so narrows the applicability of FI MC 3 that it would only be applicable in very rare circumstances.  In any event, I must follow the directions of the Appeal 
Board and accordingly, I conclude that FI MC 3 cannot be applied.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant does not have any financial interests in Israel.  This fact does not mitigate the foreign influence concerns based on FI DC 1 or 3.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 
04-02233 at 3 (App. Bd. May 9, 2006).</P> 
 
<P>I conclude that no Guideline B Mitigating Conditions apply, and I expressly and specifically indicate that I have not relied "explicitly or implicitly" on any of the 
itigating Conditions listed under Guideline B of the Directive.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 6 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2007).  </P>

<P>The following information about Israel is significant in determining whether a security concern exists under the known facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Background and Relations with the United States.  </STRONG>Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed a close friendship based on common 
democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests.  U.S. - Israeli bilateral relations are multidimensional.  The United States is the principal proponent 
of the Arab-Israeli peace process, but U.S. and Israeli views differ on various peace process issues, such as the fate of the Golan Heights, Jerusalem, and Israeli 
settlements.  The United States and Israel concluded a free-trade agreement in 1985, and the United States is Israel's largest trading partner.  Since 1976, Israel 
has been the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid.  The two countries also have very close security relations.</P> 
 
<P>Current issues in U.S. - Israeli relations include Israel's military sales to China, inadequate Israeli protection of U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-related 
cases.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Espionage - Related Cases.  </STRONG>In November 1985, Jonathan Pollard, a civilian U.S. naval intelligence employee, and his wife were charged with selling classified 
documents to Israel.  Four Israeli officials also were indicted.  The Israeli government claimed that is was a rogue operation.  Pollard was sentenced to life in 
prison and his wife to two consecutive five-year terms.  She was released in 1990, moved to Israel, and divorced Pollard.  Israelis complain that Pollard 
received an excessively harsh sentence.  Israel granted him citizenship in 1996, and he remains a cause celebre in Israel.  </P> 
 
<P>On June 13, 2005, U.S. Department of Defense analyst Lawrence Franklin was indicted for the unauthorized disclosure of classified information (about Iran) to 
a foreign diplomat.  Press reports named Na'or Gil'on, a political counselor at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, as the diplomat.  Gil'on has not been accused 
of wrongdoing and returned to Israel.  Then Foreign Minister Shalom strongly denied that Israel was involved in any activity that could harm the United States, 
and Israel's Ambassador to the United States Daniel Ayalon declared that "Israel does not spy on the United States."  Franklin had been charged earlier on 
related counts of conspiracy to communicate and disclose national defense information to "persons" not entitled to receive it.  On August 4, 2005, two former 
officials of the American Israel Political Action Committee (AIPAC), Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman, whom AIPAC fired in April 2005, were identified 
as "persons" and indicted for their parts in the conspiracy.  Both denied wrongdoing.  On October 24, their attorneys asked the court to summon Israeli 
diplomats to Washington for testimony.  On January 20, 2006, Franklin was sentenced to 12 years, 7 months in prison.  Rosen and Weissman are the first 
nongovernment employees ever to be indicted under the 1917 Espionage Act for receiving classified information orally and argue that they were exercising 
protected free speech.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>U.S. Israeli Relations.  </STRONG>Commitment to Israel's security and well being has been a cornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since Israel's creation in 
1948, in which the United States played a key supporting role.  Israel and the United States are bound closely by historic and cultural ties as well as by mutual 
interests.  Continuing U.S. economic and security assistance to Israel acknowledges these ties and signals U.S. commitment.  The broad issues of Arab-Israeli 
peace have been a major focus in the U.S. -Israeli relationship.  U.S. efforts to reach a Middle East peace settlement are based on UN Security Counsel 
Resolutions 242 and 338 and have been based on the premise that as Israel takes calculated risks for peace the United States will help minimize those risks.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>National Economic Intelligence Collection Efforts.  </STRONG>Israel has an active program to gather proprietary information within the United States.  These 
collection activities are primarily directed at obtaining information on military systems, and advanced computing applications that can be used in Israel's sizable 
armaments industry.  Two primary activities have conducted espionage activities within the United States: the Central Institute for Intelligence and Special 
Activities (MOSSAD) and the Scientific Affairs Liaison Bureau of the Defense Ministry (LAKAM).  The Israelis use classic HUMINT techniques, SIGINT, 
and computer intrusion to gain economic and proprietary information.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>As the above rather lengthy recitation of information garnered from a variety of documents<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> clearly indicates, a number of security concerns persist in relation 
to Israel despite its democratic form of government and obvious close ties to the United States.  Included, are the espionage and technology transfer cases that 
were conducted for the benefit of Israel, whether or not they were done with government knowledge and/or participation, the terrorist activity within Israel, 
and Israeli military sales are not consistent with U.S. interests.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's six siblings-in-law are citizens and residents of Israel.  Applicant has traveled to Israel four times in the past 25 years and her husband travels to 
Israel on a more frequent basis.  Accordingly, there exists at least a potential risk and danger that attempted coercion, exploitation, or pressure could be 
exerted on Applicant through his foreign relatives or to Applicant himself when she and/or her husband is visiting Israel. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Whole Person" Analysis</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to 
the whole person concept under Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that a Judge may find in favor of an applicant where no specific 
mitigating conditions apply.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Moreover, "[u]nder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant's 
life separately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant's conduct 
and circumstances."<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN>  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are used for "whole person" analysis.  Because foreign influence does 
not involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the eighth APF, </SPAN>"the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress," Directive <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.2.1.8,</SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In addition to the eighth APF, other "[a]vailable, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Directive &para; E2.2.1.  
Ultimately, the clearance decision is "an overall common sense determination."  Directive &para; E2.2.3.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>The Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address "evidence of an applicant's personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant's family's ties 
to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case." ISCR 
Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  In that same decision, the Appeal Board commended the whole person analysis in ISCR Case No. 03-02878 
at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2006), which provides:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been in the U.S for twenty years and a naturalized citizen for seven.  Her husband is also a naturalized citizen, and her children are U.S. citizens 
by birth.  Her ties to these family members are stronger than her ties to family members in Taiwan.  She has significant financial interests in the U.S. , and none 
in Taiwan.  She testified credibly that she takes her loyalty to the U.S. very seriously and would defend the interests of the U.S.  Her supervisors and co-worker 
assess her as very loyal and trustworthy.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Several circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First and more importantly, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Israel has been actively involved in espionage against 
the United States</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> Second, Applicant has connections to Israel through her siblings-in-law.  She also attended her senior year studying abroad in Israel where 
she met her husband and her first child was born.  Third, one of her siblings-in-law is receiving a government pension from Israel.  Fourth, she has occasional 
contact with her siblings-in-law, but more accurately such contact is maintained through her husband.  There is no evidence in the record to suggest Applicant 
or her husband provide any support to any relatives in Israel.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are many other countervailing, positive attributes to Applicant's life as a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting her clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Her Israeli passport is 
expired.  She has strong links or connections to the United States: (1) Applicant was born, raised, and educated in the U.S., (2) her three children are U.S. 
citizens, and all of them reside in the United States.  Each child is hard working, productive, successful, and making positive contributions to society; (3) she 
has resided in the United States for her entire life except for several years in Israel as a young woman and has continuously remained in the U.S. since she 
returned from Israel 25 years ago; (4) her husband became a U.S. citizen less than five years after arriving in the U.S; (5) her husband holds a responsible 
position as a director of probation in a major metropolitan area and holds a Department of Homeland security clearance; (6) all her real and personal property 
are in the U.S. to include owning a home.  All her financial connections are in the United States;<A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN> and (7) she credibly stated that she would never do anything 
to harm the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>There is no reason to believe that she would take any action which could cause potential harm to her U.S. family or to this country.  She<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> is patriotic, loves the 
United States, and would not permit Israel to exploit her.  She has close ties to the United States.  </SPAN>Her closest family members are her three children.  They are 
U.S citizens and live with her or near her.  Because her children live in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation by a foreign 
power<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  </SPAN>The realistic <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">possibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress is low.  I base this conclusion on her credible and sincere testimony, and I do not 
believe she would compromise national security, or otherwise comply with any Israeli threats or coercion.  Applicant has not been to Israel since 2005, and is 
unlikely to return to Israel.</SPAN><A HREF="06-07130.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  Her supervisors, coworkers and friends describe her as very honest, loyal, and trustworthy.  She is involved with her synagogue

<P><A NAME="N_27_">27. </A>I observe that there is no record evidence establishing: (1) any connection or contact between Applicant and any foreign government; (2) any financial 
interests between Applicant and any foreign nation, or any foreign business concern; (3) her failure to follow the rules or her failure to require those around him 
to do the same on projects requiring security clearances; (4) any lack of the respect and trust of her employer, her friends, or family; (5) a problem for 
Applicant in the areas of honesty or integrity; (6) her siblings-in-law are or have been, political activists or journalists, challenging the policies of the Israeli 
government, or that they otherwise engage in activities which would bring attention to themselves; (7) the Israeli government has approached any of her 
siblings-in-law living in Israel for any reason; (8) that Israeli officials are even aware of her work for a government contractor.  As such, there is a reduced 
possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Israeli government, which occasionally seeks to quiet those which speak out against it.  
I conclude, however, that the government has no burden to present such evidence, and the absence of evidence does not support application of any mitigating 
condition, or approval of a clearance.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-21927, 2006 DOHA Lexis 229, at *39-*41 (A.J. May 17, 2006) (discussing absence of evidence

receives access to classified information. <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 10 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005),
