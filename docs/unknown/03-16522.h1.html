<P>The Applicant came from Iran to the United States in 1984.  She married a native born American in 1993, and became a naturalized citizen in 1995.  She 
attended college in the U.S., and received a degree in 2001.  Her father, mother and sister are citizens of and live in Iran.  Her father is 83 and her mother 76.  
Both retired before the Iranian revolution.  Her sister works for a private insurance company as an underwriter.  Her contact with her Iranian relatives is limited 
to 3 or 4 times a year.  She owns a 1/3 interest in her parents house.  She intends to transfer her interest to her sister, and her interest pales in comparison to her 
and her spouse's $400,000 net worth in the U.S.  She would not submit to coercion, exploitation or pressure from a foreign government vis-a-vis her Iranian 
relatives.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 5, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about February 4, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on March 22, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 8, 2004, and the case was heard on May 18, 2004.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who called a witness to testify on her behalf.  The transcript was 
received on June 3, 2004.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's perceived foreign influence militates against the granting of a security clearance.  
[The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">42, and is employed by a 
defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline B - Foreign Influence</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant came from Iran to the United States in 1984 (Transcript (TR) at page 18 line 7 to page 19 line 13, and at page 21 lines 12~18).  She married a 
native born American in 1993, and became a naturalized citizen in 1995 (<EM>id</EM>, and TR at page 35 line 24 to page 39 line 9).  She attended college in the U.S., and 
received a degree in 2001.  (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 1). </P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.e.  The Applicant's parents are citizens of and reside in Iran (GX 1 at page 3).  Her 83 year old father is a retired civil engineer (TR at page 14 line 22 to 
page 15 line 17, and at page 24 line 5 to page 25 line 10).  He retired before the fall of the Shah of Iran (<EM>id</EM>).  Her 76 year old mother is retired from working for 
a school district (TR at page 15 line 18 to page 16 line 5, and at page 26 lines 10~22).  She also retired before the fall of the Shah of Iran (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant's 
36 year old sister works for a private insurance company as an underwriter (TR at page 16 lines 6~17, and at page 27 line 20 to page 28 line 17).  The Applicant 
contacts her Iranian relative only about 3 or 4 times a year (TR at page 17 lines 6~20, and at page 25 lines 12~18).  Without the Applicant's prior knowledge, 
her parents gave the Applicant a 1/3 interest in their house in Iran (TR at page 16 line 18 to page 17 line 6, at page 29 line 9 to page 30 line 16, and at page 31 
line 18 to page 32 line 4).  </P> 
 
<P>She intends to give her 1/3 interest to her sister (<EM>id</EM>).  The Applicant's and her spouse's net worth in the U.S. is about $400,000 (TR at page 22 line 14 to page 
23 line 5, and at page 35 lines 13~18).  She would not submit to coercion, exploitation or pressure from a foreign government vis-a-vis her Iranian relatives (TR 
at page 30 line 17 to page 31 line 6).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's Manager and Test Lead aver that she is trustworthy, and should be granted a security clearance (AppXs A and B).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, 
as set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
disqualifying conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is subject to a foreign influence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United 
States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When the Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1995, she renounced her Iranian citizenship.  She married a native born American and pursued her college 
education as an American at an American institution.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's parents and sister, however, are citizens of and live in Iran.  The second disqualifying condition under Foreign Influence is therefore applicable 
as "[a]n immediate family member . . . is a citizen of . . . a foreign country."  Her parents are elderly, both having  retired prior to the current regime coming to 
power.  Her sister works for a private insurance company as an underwriter.  None of the Applicant's immediate family are presently connected with any 
government, and there is no evidence that their presence in Iran can be exploited by any government.  In addition, I conclude that it would be unlikely that the 
Applicant would even consider any such attempt at exploitation.  The first mitigation condition is therefore applicable as "the immediate family members . . . 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
persons involved and the United States."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant does own a 1/3 interest in her parents house.  She intends to transfer her interest to her sister.  This 1/3 interest is not "substantial;" and as such, 
the last disqualifying condition is not applicable.  Were it deemed to be substantial, this "[f]oreign financial interest" would be "minimal" when compared to 
her $400,000 U.S. net worth.  The third mitigating condition would therefore be applicable.  As mitigation is shown, Guideline B is also found in the 
Applicant's favor.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding her alleged foreign influence.  The Applicant has thus met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
