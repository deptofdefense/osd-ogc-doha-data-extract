<P>Applicant has abused alcohol for nearly 30 years, and has one alcohol-related arrest. He has engaged in habitual binge drinking, consuming for several years as 
much as a case of beer a day. He currently drinks an average at least four mixed drinks per sitting at least four times weekly. He has also twice undergone 
alcohol counseling and treatment for alcohol abuse, and was able to stop drinking after each for up to five years. However, each time he eventually resumed 
drinking, quickly exceeding his previous consumption levels. Applicant suspects he has a drinking problem, but does not intend to permanently stop or modify 
his alcohol consumption. He has failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline G. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 6, 2003 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (SOR) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOHA 
adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On February 27, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 21, 2003, and, on March 28, 
2003, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting this case to be heard on April 15, 2003. All parties appeared as scheduled and the Government presented three 
exhibits (GE 1 through 3), which were admitted as evidence without objection. Applicant relied on a letter attached to his Answer, which was included in the 
record without objection, his own testimony, and the testimony of two other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on April 23, 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. Accordingly, those allegations are entered as facts. After a thorough review of the 
pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 49-years-old and works as a systems analyst for a defense contractor. He began drinking alcohol in 1973 when he was 19-years-old. He grew up in 
a dysfunctional home where his step-father mentally and physically abused him. Drinking was Applicant's way of coping with his troubles. As a young man, 
Applicant's drink of choice was beer, which he consumed at the rate of about six 12-ounce beers several times a week. From 1973 until 1976, he was a member 
of a religious cult that frowned on drinking, yet Applicant continued to drink at this rate after work. Applicant considered this amount of drinking to be 
"moderate." From 1976 to 1984, Applicant's tolerance for alcohol increased to the point where he would drink as many as 24 beers a day.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In June 1984, Applicant was arrested, charged and convicted of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. Before trial, on advice of his lawyer, he enrolled in an 
alcohol counseling program.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> After his conviction, he was awarded probation for one year and ordered to continue alcohol counseling for six months. From 
1984 until 1989, Applicant did not consume alcohol; however, he resumed drinking to help him deal with various problems at work and in his personal life. His 
alcohol consumption quickly escalated to the point he was drinking 12 beers a day and a half-pint of liquor two or three times a week as well.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Around 1989 or 1990, Applicant went to work for a defense contractor on an island in the Caribbean supporting a Navy engineering program. Alcohol was 
prevalent during off-duty hours<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and Applicant's drinking became such a problem that he was "tricked" into entering a seven-week alcohol treatment program 
there. Applicant avers that he thought he was to be seen for seizures he suffered periodically, but he was, in fact, admitted for alcohol counseling. While he 
denies excessive alcohol use at the time, as discussed above he also acknowledges his consumption was about 12 beers a day after he resumed drinking in 
1989.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In 1992, Applicant moved back in with his parents for about two years. He sought counseling for depression and treatment for his seizures. He reduced his 
drinking and was generally happier. However, in 1994, when he moved to the area where he now lives and works, his drinking increased because he was 
depressed about his employment conditions.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Since about October 1998, Applicant stopped drinking beer, preferring instead straight shots of tequila or mixed drinks such as vodka and orange juice. He 
drinks almost daily at a rate of about four or five drinks per sitting. He usually drinks for three to five hours after work, and intersperses his drinks with water or 
iced tea. At times, Applicant has also consumed four or five straight shots of tequila at a bar after work, driven home and had four or five more shots of tequila 
to help him get to sleep.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> On special occasions, Applicant has far exceeded his normal alcohol consumption. For example, he has gone to Super Bowl parties 
expecting to drink so much that "it will be clear [he is] not going anywhere that day."<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant last drank alcohol on Friday, February 21, 2003, consuming three or four mixed drinks. The following Monday, Applicant was seen by a doctor who 
recommended he stop drinking. The doctor was apparently concerned about Applicant's weight (in excess of 300 pounds), his high blood pressure, and an 
adverse test result on his liver related to excess alcohol consumption.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant thinks he has "somewhat" of a drinking problem, and has been concerned about his alcohol use for the past year.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He also thought he had a drinking 
problem when he was arrested  for DUI in 1984, but his concern waned after he went to counseling and stopped drinking until 1989.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Overall, however, 
Applicant does not feel alcohol is a significant problem because he is overweight and is able to absorb more alcohol than most people, and he never feels he is 
intoxicated. Applicant equates being intoxicated to having difficulty walking straight or being nearly incoherent.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's history of substance abuse also includes significant use of illegal drugs (marijuana, cocaine, LSD, hashish, amphetamines, and PCP) from 1973 
until at least 1998. His use of hashish, PCP, LSD, and amphetamines was extensive, but ended when he was in his mid- to late-20s. He continued to use 
marijuana and cocaine in significant amounts, engaging in small-scale dealing to support his personal usage. He estimates he spent about $2,500.00 on cocaine 
up to 1998.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's company and government managers hold him in high regard. They have praised his work ethic and determination. There have been no alcohol-related concerns in the five years he has held his current job, and they have not observed any adverse alcohol-related conduct by Applicant in their social 
interactions with him outside the workplace.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative guideline to be applied here is Guideline G 
(Alcohol Consumption).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in 
ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
Government.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption). </STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control 
impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has established its case under Guideline G by showing that Applicant was arrested for DUI in 1984 and that he regularly consumes alcohol to 
the point of intoxication. On special occasions he has engaged in binge drinking, and his drinking history includes excessive amounts of alcohol consumption 
on a routine basis. Applicant claims that because he can drink more than the average person without experiencing any overt signs of intoxication he does not 
have a problem. I disagree. Applicant drinks a lot of alcohol on a near daily basis by anyone's standard. The fact that he can walk a straight line and does not 
have trouble speaking does not mean his judgment is not impaired. Indeed, he admits that sometimes he waits a half-hour or so before he leaves his favorite bar 
for the drive home because he may feel a little unstable from drinking.<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> He fails to appreciate the more fundamental point that driving home after drinking his 
usual four or five drinks reflects poorly on his judgment. Guideline G Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 5<A HREF="01-23159.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply here.</P> 
 
<P>By contrast, none of the Guideline G Mitigating Conditions apply. While he has recently stopped drinking for a few weeks before the hearing, it is clear he did 
so only in response to the SOR. Likewise, his doctor's visit was motivated solely by the immediacy of this security clearance determination. Make no mistake, I 
recognize he has made an effort towards changing his drinking habits and should be encouraged to continue in this regard, if for no other reason than to avert 
serious health problems. However, in light of his extensive history of alcohol abuse, two months of sobriety does not sufficiently mitigate the disqualifying 
information available to the government. Applicant has been drinking heavily for most of his life, and previous periods of sobriety far longer than this have 
ended with Applicant resuming his drinking as much as or more than what he drank before abstaining. Further, he will only commit to abstinence from alcohol 
for the near future, and, based on statements he made during his background investigation, he will likely continue to drink as he has in the past.</P> 
 
<P>I have carefully weighed all of the evidence in this case, and I have applied the aforementioned disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each 
applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. Under this rubric, I have also considered the fact that Applicant 
abused several illegal drugs as well as alcohol, a legal drug. I can only conclude that he is likely to continue to engage in some form of substance abuse - most 
likely alcohol - in such a way as to undermine the government's confidence in his ability to safeguard classified information. I conclude Guideline G against the 
Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P>
