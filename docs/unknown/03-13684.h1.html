<P>While Applicant has a history of DuI arrests and convictions over an eight-year period spanning 1996 and August 2002 (for which he received counseling and 
probation, respectively, following each of his two such incidents), he has since committed to AA and sustained abstinence (almost 20 months).  Never 
diagnosed with being either alcohol-dependent or an alcohol abuser, Applicant has averted any alcohol-related incident or abusive situation since his last DuI 
incident in August 2002.  With almost 20 months of sobriety and an AA network to provide support, Applicant persuades he will be able to sustain his self 
imposed abstinence future.  Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On November 25, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on December 23, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on February 24, 2004.  Applicant  responded to the FORM within the 30 days provided him with supplemental documentation 
regarding his alcohol issues.   The case was assigned to me March 29, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to have been twice arrested on DuI charges: once in January 1996, to which he plead guilty and was imposed probation 
before judgment and ordered to complete an alcohol treatment program, and again in August 2002, to which he plead guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail 
(with 50 days suspended) and two years of supervised probation and ordered to complete and alcohol treatment program.  Applicant is alleged to have attended 
a 6-week  alcohol treatment program (A facility) pursuant to the court's order between March and May 1996, and another 6-week alcohol treatment program 
with the same facility following his 2002 DuI arrest and conviction.  Applicant's DuI arrests and convictions are re-alleged by incorporation under Guideline J.  </P> 
 
<P>For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of  the allegations.  He denied being assessed by A facility and that his DuI arrests should be considered 
criminal conduct governed by Guideline J.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 53-year-old logistian  for a defense contractors  who seeks a security clearance.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant 
are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After consuming about 12 beers in a local restaurant in January 1996, Applicant drove too fast on his way home and crashed his vehicle.  He left the scene 
briefly to find a tow truck.  When he returned he found the police waiting and was arrested on charges of DuI.  In court he plead guilty and was imposed 
probation before judgment and ordered to attend an alcohol treatment program with A facility.  The program was essentially educational in scope and did not 
entail individual assessments by licensed treatment physicians or counselors.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant self-referred himself to A facility for assessment and counseling in March 1996.  He was assigned to the facility's 6-week alcohol education program, 
which he successfully completed in May 1996 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 9).  While he provided background information to A facility's substance abuse counselors, his 
counseling records don't report any diagnosis of his condition.  He is credited with being honest in answering the questionnaire provided by the facility.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested again on DuI charges in August 2002.  This arrest followed his drinking in a local nightclub.  After consuming two to three alcoholic 
beverages over a one-hour period, he again made the mistake of driving home.  After colliding with another vehicle on the way home, investigating police 
arrested him for DuI.  In court he plead guilty to DuI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail (50 days suspended), in addition to being placed on two years 
probation and ordered to complete an alcohol treatment program.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant self-referred himself again to A facility following his 2002 DuI conviction (entering the program in August 2002) and is credited with successfully 
completing the education program's 6-month outpatient course.  His counseling records indicate he was assessed but not diagnosed with any kind of an alcohol 
problem by the facility's staff.  His program participation encompassed weekly group sessions as well as random urine screens.  His attendance was considered 
satisfactory, and his records indicate he was scheduled to complete the program in February 2003.</P> 
 
<P>While not believing he has ever been addicted to alcohol, Applicant realized he had an alcohol problem after his second DuI in August 2002.  Applicant assures 
he not only completed his 6-month A facility alcohol education program successfully, but that he has been a regular participant in AA and has maintained his 
abstinence from alcohol since August 2002, a period of almost 20 months.  A fellow AA-participant of Applicant's corroborates Applicant's AA 
attendance/abstinence claims.  This fellow participant credits Applicant with receiving chips commemorating his sobriety through 18 months and attests to 
Applicant's commitment to remain alcohol-free.  Applicant's assurances that  he has no intention of returning to drinking are accepted.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by his program manager who describes him as not only skilled and responsible but a person who has impressed him with his 
positive lifestyle changes since his 2002 DuI conviction.  The supervisor interacts with Applicant daily and didn't notice even the slightest indication of the 
latter having an alcohol problem, or even consuming alcohol.  He credits Applicant with being a superior employee of utmost trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list "binding" policy considerations to be made by Judges in the decision making process covering 
DOHA cases. The term "binding," as interpreted by the DOHA Appeal Board, requires the Judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security 
clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the Judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In 
addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in 
E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the 
risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1 Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a 
threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense 
appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the 
relevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical 
basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant presents as a highly regarded  logistian for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  His two alcohol-related incidents over the eight years 
reflect alcohol abuse by Applicant and documented proof of his having a recurring problem with alcohol through August 2002 (when he was involved in his 
last-reported DuI incident).   Never diagnosed as an abusive drinker or alcohol dependent, Applicant, nonetheless, occasionally drank excessively while in night 
club social situations. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his 1996 DuI conviction, Applicant was court-ordered to attend education and counseling classes.  This counseling afforded him some relief from 
episodic drinking excesses for a while, but did not prevent his recurrent problem in 2002.  Having resumed his drinking in social situations, he confronted law 
enforcement authorities on a second occasion: this one in August 2002 following an accident on the way home.  Pleading guilty<EM> </EM>to a DuI charge arising out of 
this incident, he accepted a sentence of 60 days in jail (50 days suspended), two years of supervised probation and court-ordered alcohol education.  On the 
strength of the evidence presented, one disqualifying condition (DC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: DC 1 (alcohol-related incidents away from work). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Assessment of Applicant's alcohol-related conduct must be made on the basis of a review of the entire evidentiary record developed to date, not merely the 
information developed with respect to his identified two DuI offenses.  In making an overall assessment of Applicant's clearance eligibility, major emphasis 
must be accorded his most recent drinking history, which includes his impressive commitment to AA attendance, his sustained abstinence (almost 20 months), 
highly regarded work history, and the absence of any more alcohol-related incidents since his August 2002 incident.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By his actions and improved understanding, Applicant demonstrates he has taken the necessary restorative and corrective measures in his personal affairs to 
ensure that he does not repeat the same or similar judgment lapses associated with his prior problems with alcohol abuse.  His mitigation efforts reflect 
important sobriety decisions and a lifetime commitment to abstinence, aided by his AA network support.  During the last 20 months, he has been able to avert 
any alcohol abuse relapses or recurring problems with law enforcement authorities.  So while he still has several  months to go on his court-ordered probation 
(based on this administrative record), his reformative efforts provide a good and sufficient foundation for making predictive judgements about his ability to 
sustain his manageable drinking in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's demonstrated efforts to remedy his judgment lapses associated with alcohol abuse enable him to take advantage of one of the mitigating conditions 
(MC) of the Adjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption: MC 3 (positive changes in behavior).  Altogether, Applicant provides sufficient demonstrative 
indications of sustained mitigation of both his drinking problems and encounters with law enforcement authorities  to overcome any residual security risks 
associated with his past alcohol-related judgment lapses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the record as a whole, Applicant makes the convincing showing that he has both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any 
recurrent problems with judgment lapses related to alcohol and personal conduct (repeated rule violations)  to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at 
risk to judgment impairment associated with such conduct.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the alcohol-related allegations covered by Guidelines 
G and J. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision in this case, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines 
of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the 
factors listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:</SPAN></P>
