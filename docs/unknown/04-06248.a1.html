<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 17, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
(SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On March 15, 2006, after considering the record, 
Chief Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales  denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.<A HREF="04-06248.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive 
&para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guidelines E is arbitrary, capricious or 
contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision should be reversed because it is based upon erroneous findings derived from a 
neglectful investigation that did not throughly and completely acquire proper information regarding her employment history.  Applicant also argues she did not 
deliberately or intentionally make false statements on her security clearance application.  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The methods and scope of Defense Security Service investigations are outside the scope of review of the Appeal Board.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See e.g. </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-0293 at 4 
(App. Bd. May 5, 2000).  The Administrative Judge is not responsible for gathering evidence for the benefit of either party.  DOHA proceedings are adversarial 
in nature and each party is responsible for gathering and presenting evidence for the Judge to consider. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>Directive &para;&para; E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.  The Judge 
has the responsibility to exercise reasonable control over the development of the record evidence by the parties to ensure that a case proceeds in a fair, timely, 
and orderly manner.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 3-4 (Apr. 26, 2002).  A review of the proceedings below persuades the Board that Applicant was 
placed on reasonable notice that she was responsible for presenting evidence on her behalf, and that the Judge would base his decision on record evidence 
presented by the parties for his consideration.  Applicant did not file a timely response to the government's file of relevant material.  She cannot fairly claim 
that the Judge was obligated to consider information that had not been presented to him.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-09209 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The findings which Applicant challenges are permissible characterizations by the Administrative Judge of the evidence that was before him.  Applicant has not 
met her burden of demonstrating that the Judge's material findings with respect Applicant's conduct of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible 
interpretation of the record evidence.  The Board does not review a case </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de novo</EM>.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge's material findings of 
security concern are sustainable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's statements about her intent and state of mind when she executed her security clearance application were relevant evidence, but they were not 
binding on the Administrative Judge. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider 
Applicant's statements in light of the record evidence as a whole, and Applicant's denial of any intent to provide false information did not preclude the Judge 
from weighing the record evidence and making  findings that contradicted Applicant's denials.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  The security concerns raised by Applicant's falsification were 
not necessarily mitigated by Applicant's subsequent disclosures to the government.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19513 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Judge weighed the evidence that was presented to him, evaluated the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible 
application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors. The Judge found in Applicant's favor with respect to most of the SOR allegations.  
However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which was before him was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the 
record </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.</SPAN></P>
