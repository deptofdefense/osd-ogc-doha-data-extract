<P>Applicant was laid off from work in March 2001, and, for an extended period of time thereafter, unable to find sufficient employment to enable him to remain 
current on his debts. He is now working two jobs and making steady progress in satisfying all delinquent accounts. He has mitigated the financial considerations 
security concern, and related criminal conduct arising from his failure to timely file tax returns for the years he was unemployed/underemployed. Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations), and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was 
received by DOHA on July 21, 2004, denied all SOR allegations except subparagraphs 1.c., 1.I, 1.l., and 1.o., and requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on December 8, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on December 8, 2004, scheduling the hearing for December 29, 2004. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted five documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5, and admitted 
into the record without objection. At the request of the Government, Administrative notice was taken of 26 U.S.C. &sect; 7203 without objection. Applicant testified 
and submitted 37 exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-37, and admitted into the record without objection. The record was held open to 
provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation in support of his case. Fourteen additional documents were received, marked as AE 38-51, and admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on January 10, 2005.  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to some SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make 
the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant, a 35-year-old man who has never been married and has no dependents, is employed as a security guard by a defense contractor. He graduated from 
high school in 1987, has completed almost two years of college, and is presently pursuing an associate's degree. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Air 
Force from April 1990 until he was honorably discharged in May 1999 as a Sergeant. He served as a telecommunications systems control technician in the Air 
Force, and possessed a top-secret security clearance with sensitive compartmented access. There were never any complaints or allegations made alleging he 
mishandled or otherwise threatened the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant left active duty in the Air Force for higher paying employment. He was employed by a telecommunications company as a network operations 
technician from May 1999 until his employment was abruptly terminated on March 2, 2001, due to a business realignment. (AE 1) Applicant's gross salary for 
the 2001 tax year was $26,167.00. (AE 31) He was provided $1,200.00 in severance pay upon his termination, and thereafter attempted to subsist on 
unemployment compensation while seeking a new job. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant, unsuccessful in finding new employment in the locale where he was living, took up residence with a friend in his present state of residence hoping to 
find acceptable work there. After a period of time the friend asked him to leave, and he resided in his car for several months while continuing to search for a 
job. He remained unemployed until September 2001, when he found work as a stocker at a large retail store. To supplement his income, he worked part-time as 
a custodian for a cleaning service from January 2002 until May 2002, and at a golf course from June 2002 until October 2002. He was hired as a full-time 
security guard by his present employer in January 2003, and continues to work part-time as a stocker at the retail store.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is paid $9.45 per hour at his full-time job, and nets approximately $1,360.00 per month. He is paid $8.10 per hour at his part-time job, works about 
16-20 hours per week, and nets about $500.00 per month. His letters of recommendation from both places of employment, and the friend who he resided with 
for a time, establish he is considered reliable, conscientious, honest, trustworthy, and a good and dependable employee.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was financially solvent until losing his job in March 2001. The only previous adverse information concerning him was a student loan that became 
delinquent in approximately 1993, which he resolved.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> His finances began a dramatic downward spiral when he lost his job, which continued as he was forced 
to accept employment at a greatly reduced wage. Since regaining steady employment, Applicant has been repaying his past-due creditors and is well on his way 
to fully regaining financial stability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The collection account alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a. was paid off in April 2004 by application of an income tax refund. (AE 21) The charged off account 
alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.b. was paid in July 2004. (AE 22) Applicant testified he is making payments on the past due account alleged in SOR 
subparagraph 1.d., and that account is current, although he did not provide any proof of payment. He has been making payments on the charged off account 
listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e. since June 2004. (AE 23)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant paid the charged off account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f. in June 2004. (AE 25) Applicant testified he is making payments on the past due 
account alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.g., and that account is current, although he again did not provide proof of payment. The account listed in SOR 
subparagraph 1.h. is the same account that is listed in subparagraph 1.a., and the account listed in subparagraph 1.j. is the same account that is listed in 
subparagraph 1.d.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The charged off account listed in SOR subparagraph 1.k. has been paid. (AE 29) Applicant claims to be making payments on the past due account listed in SOR 
subparagraph 1.m., but again did not provide proof of payment. The only evidence in support of the allegation of nonpayment of a personal property tax that is 
made in SOR subparagraph 1.n. is Applicant's statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service in January 2004. Applicant testified he was mistaken 
when he told the agent he was delinquent in payment of that tax, and he in fact does not owe the state anything. (AE 30)          </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant made an admittedly bad decision by purchasing a timeshare in June 2001 after losing his job with the telecommunications company under an 
assumption that he would soon find acceptable replacement employment. That past due debt is reflected in SOR subparagraph 1.c. in the amount of $6,598.00. 
Applicant made substantial payments on the account, totaling $1,600.00, between October 2002 and August 2003, (AE 15) and has unsuccessfully attempted to 
work out a settlement with the creditor. Although not alleged in the SOR, he has also become delinquent on accumulated annual maintenance fees on the 
property in the amount of $927.27 on which he has successfully negotiated a $75.00 per month repayment plan. (AE 48)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To date, Applicant has not made any payment on the charged off accounts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.i, and 1.l. He has, however, negotiated a repayment 
plan on the account in subparagraph 1.l. that will require him to make payments of $210.05 per month for 36 months to repay the debt in full. (AE 51)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant sought the assistance of a credit counseling service in July 2002, and was scheduled to begin a plan whereby he would repay his creditors by making 
payments to the service of $79.68 weekly. (AE 7) However, before he could begin with the plan, his car was repossessed and he had to pay $1,000.00 to get the 
car back, which he did with the assistance of his neighbor. (AE 1) As a result, he had to forego the repayment plan through the service. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant paid $8,263.00,  through withholdings, in federal income taxes for the year 2000. However, that was an underpayment of $358.00, which, with 
interest and penalties, left him owing $610.68. He failed to file income tax returns for the years 2001 and 2002, although he had refunds owing him in the 
amounts of $1,044.78 and $0.01 respectively. He also failed to file a tax return for  the year 2003, and currently owes $113.65 for that year. Applicant has 
worked out a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service whereby he is paying $60.00 per month with a total balance owing on all back taxes of $561.34 
as of November 2004. Applicant testified the reason he didn't file tax returns, despite being owed refunds for two of the three years, was because he was 
attempting to get his life together after losing his job and figured it was something he could take care of later. </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
financial considerations, and Guideline J, criminal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access 
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.<A HREF="04-02986.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.  An</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an 
individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving 
responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had numerous accounts, including income taxes, that became delinquent after he suddenly lost his job in March 2001. Many of those debts remained 
delinquent for several years, and some still are delinquent. DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>: and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts </EM>apply in this case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's financial troubles are directly attributable to his unexpected loss of employment and difficulty in finding work thereafter. His willingness to accept 
work as a stocker and custodian, having previously been employed as a technician in the Air Force and telecommunications industry, demonstrates his extended 
unemployment was not by choice. Mitigating Condition (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. 
loss of employment, . . .</EM>) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant sought out financial counseling in an effort to resolve his debt problems in July 2002, but was unable to undertake the payments that were called for. 
He has now repaid a number of his creditors, and is making payments to others. Although he still has two creditors he needs to make arrangements with, his 
actions thus far, including working two jobs and satisfying several creditors in full, indicate he is making a good-faith effort to repay all past due accounts. MC 
6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts </EM>applies.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline F is decided for Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant violated 26 U.S.C. &sect; 7203, a misdemeanor, by willfully failing to file federal tax returns for the tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003. DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>applies. As indicated by the various notices from the IRS contained in AE 31, Applicant filed returns for those years 
sometime prior to March 2004, long before he received the SOR. He was owed a refund for two of the years, and has entered into a repayment plan that will 
have satisfied the other year for which he filed late in short order. Finally, his motive for not filing the returns was obviously not the intent of not paying his 
taxes. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM> apply. Guideline J is 
decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct and financial considerations security 
concerns. Accordingly, he has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is clearly consistent with the national interest to
