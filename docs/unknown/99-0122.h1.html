<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	On February 23, 1999, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,"</EM> dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program"</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and
modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	In sworn written statements, dated April 27, 1999 and July 8, 1999,<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Applicant responded
to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and eventually requested a hearing.  The case was assigned
to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on July 30, 1999.  A notice of hearing was issued on
August 2, 1999, and the hearing was held before me on August 18, 1999.  During the course of the
hearing, four Government exhibits, and the testimony of one Government witness, and two
Applicant witnesses (including the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on
August 25, 1999.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG><U>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><U></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	During the proceeding, Department Counsel moved for me to take Official Notice of certain
portions of the Annotated Laws of Massachusetts under Part IV. Crimes, Punishments and
Proceedings in Criminal Cases, Title I. Crimes and Punishments, Chapter 265. Crimes Against the
Person, Section 13A, and 13B--pertaining to Assault and Assault and Battery, and Indecent Assault
and Battery on Child under Fourteen, respectively.  There being no objection, I took Official Notice
of the cited provisions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Applicant has admitted all but one of the factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct
under Criterion E (subparagraphs 1.a., and 1.c.  through 1.g.), as well as the one allegation pertaining
to criminal activity under Criterion J (subparagraph 2.a.).  Those admissions are incorporated herein
as findings of fact.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Applicant is a 47 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to regain
a SECRET security clearance which had previously been revoked.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Applicant has been married four times.  He was married to his first wife during 1971-74 and
again during 1977-80.  He was married to his second wife during 1982-96, and they had three
children.  He married his third, and current, wife, in July 1998.  He has seemingly had a somewhat
volatile relationship with several close family members, resulting in police or court involvement,
during a three year period commencing in late 1995.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	The initial incident occurred in November 1995 when the police were called to his residence
by a person not identified during a "situation" with Applicant's son.  The child, whose age was not
revealed, has a combination of conditions, including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD); Tourette's Disorder; and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  During the incident,
Applicant's son "lost control," and attacked Applicant, ripping his shirt.  Applicant physically
restrained his son and took him to his room.  As a result of the episode, the police were called to the
residence, but no charges were filed and no further "official" action was ever taken.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	The second "incident" occurred some time in March 1996, when Applicant and his second
wife were having a dispute over her spending money in a manner which he felt was frivolous, and
his opening a separate bank account in order to pay the bills.  Although there is no evidence that
Applicant threatened physical violence or that his wife feared any such physical violence, their
dispute resulted in her obtaining a temporary restraining order requiring that he remain away from
their son.  The order was canceled approximately one week later.  No further "official" action was
ever taken.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	The third incident occurred in December 1997,<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> when Applicant and his then-girlfriend--his
current wife--became involved a verbal dispute over money and her receiving his ex-wife's mail.
The money issue developed over his having to work overtime to pay off his older financial
obligations.  For some reason, not otherwise explained, Applicant called the police during the
argument.  The police arrived after the dispute had already been resolved, and offered him an
opportunity to leave the residence in order to cool off.  Applicant accepted the offer and was
transported to the police station.  He was released without any charges being filed, and no
further"official" action was ever taken.</FONT></P>

<P>	The fourth incident--a purely verbal dispute--occurred in January 1998,<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> and once again,
involved the same issues and the same disputants as the third incident.  This time, however, the
police were called by a neighbor.  Upon their arrival, the police informed both parties of their rights,
and, without further "official" action, departed the premises.</P>

<P>	The fifth incident occurred in March 1998,<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> and started out as a verbal disagreement between
the same disputants as the third and fourth incidents over her refusal to leave a billiard parlor.
Applicant left her and returned home at about 10:15PM, but his then-girlfriend did not return to their
shared home until about 1:45AM. The dispute turned physical when Applicant tried to leave, but his
exit was blocked by his then-girlfriend.  He tried to "shoulder" his way past her, and while doing so,
bumped into her, injuring her eye.  It is unclear who called the police.  The police arrived at the
residence at about 2AM, and after interviewing the victim, arrested Applicant for domestic assault
and battery.  The victim refused medical treatment.  Applicant remained in jail overnight, and was
bailed out the following morning.  Applicant's case was continued without a finding until July 1998.</P>

<P>	The sixth, and most recent incident, occurred nearly four weeks later, also in March 1998,<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>
and again involved the same disputants.  They became involved in a verbal dispute which
deteriorated into a physical confrontation with mutual slapping.  The police report mentions
"drunkenness" being a factor, but other than one such brief reference, there is no evidence to support
that situation.  For some, unexplained reason, Applicant called the police.  When they arrived at the
scene at about mid-night, the circumstances of the dispute were discussed, and Applicant was
arrested for domestic assault and battery.  While Applicant sustained a minor injury to his ear and
hand, both disputants refused medical attention.  Applicant remained in jail overnight, and was
bailed out the following morning.</P>

<P>	As a direct result of the two March 1998 arrests, the charges were joined and Applicant
entered an admission to facts sufficient for a finding of guilty.  The dispositional terms ordered by
the court were:  the matters were continued without finding for one year; Applicant was directed to
pay $35.00 to the victim/witness fund; he was placed on supervised probation until July 1999; and
ordered to attend the Batterers' Treatment Program.<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant commenced attending weekly counseling sessions at a center for addictive
behavior in October 1998.  Upon completion of those sessions, he was to participate in one dozen
weekly individual awareness group sessions.<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  In addition, he started attending group batterers'
counseling sessions, and at the time of the hearing, had six weeks of sessions left to successfully
complete his program.</P>

<P>	On three occasions, in October 1997, October 1998, and February 1999, Applicant violated
security rules and regulations of his employer.  The first incident occurred when, as a "controlled
room" custodian, he left the room unattended for more than 10 minutes.  Applicant was in and out
of the room for brief periods attending to other matters, and his absence was reported by someone
who wanted to drop off some classified equipment, but who had to wait until Applicant returned to
the room.<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A>  No classified information was left unattended, and no compromises occurred.  As a result
of his violation, he was given a warning by the company security officer.  The other two incidents
involved Applicant's failure, at the end of the work day, to secure the dial lock on a particular
cabinet.  Neither incident involved compromise of classified information.<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP>(10)</SUP></A>  It is unclear if
subsequent action was taken against Applicant for the violations.</P>

<P>	No evidence was produced regarding Applicant's work performance.</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in
evaluating security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the
adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny
or revoke an individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions)
and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access
to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad
rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision--an expansion
of the factors set forth in Section F.3. of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative
Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the
"whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,
favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a purposeful decision.  The Adjudicative
Process factors which an Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and
seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at
the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or
recurrence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative
guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>	[Personal Conduct - Criterion E]: Conduct involving questionable judgment,
untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could
indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	(4)	personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or pressure;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	(5)	a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	(5)	the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>	[Criminal Conduct - Criterion J]: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates
doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	(1)	any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	(2)	a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	<STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	(4)	the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	(5)	there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision
in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly
consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="99-0122.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP>(11)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."
For the purposes herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards
are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those conclusions
that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have
attempted to avoid drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the
Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified
information.  If the Government meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon
the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to
overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship
that the Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals
to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by
necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail
to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified
information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty and patriotism
are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover
many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty and patriotism.  Nothing in this
Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any
express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty or patriotism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and
after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described
briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	With respect to Criterion E, the Government has established its case.  Examination of
Applicant's actions reveals a pattern of conduct involving explosive relationships with several
individuals which has evolved into verbal disputes and physical clashes.  Applicant's apparent
inability to control his impulses or manage his anger have seemingly contributed to a number of
incidents, the last two of which resulted in his arrest and eventual court action.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's overall
questionable personal conduct in this regard ostensibly falls within Personal Conduct Disqualifying
Condition (DC) 4.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	On its face, Applicant's initial incident in November 1995, nominally falls within the pattern
of his explosive relationship, but is, in fact, something quite different.  The evidence is unrebutted
that Applicant's son has a combination of conditions, including ADHD, Tourette's Disorder, and
Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and that the son "lost control" and attacked Applicant.  The son's
conduct required Applicant to physically restrain his son and take him to his room.  That action by
Applicant, without more, does not raise questions as to Applicant's judgment, trustworthiness, or
reliability, and the fact that police may have been called, in this instance, does not enhance the
security significance of the "altercation."  Under the circumstances, Applicant has, through evidence
of extenuation and explanation, successfully overcome the Government's case with respect to
allegation 1.a. of the SOR, and that allegation is concluded in favor of Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	The second "incident"--the obtaining of a temporary restraining order by Applicant's then-wife, without more, in light of the strained marital relationship which apparently existed prior to the
eventual divorce</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">, and with Applicant's unrebutted explanation, also fails to </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">raise questions as to
Applicant's judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability.  Thus, it appears to be of little security
significance.  Under the circumstances, Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and
explanation, successfully overcome the Government's case with respect to allegation 1.b. of the
SOR, and that allegation is also concluded in favor of Applicant.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	The third and fourth incidents--both purely verbal disputes between Applicant and his then-girlfriend in December 1997 and January 1998--are slightly different in the overall scheme of
security significance.  If those incidents had existed without any subsequent verbal/physical
altercations or arrests, their security significance, in my estimation, would be nil.  However, two
subsequent incidents, both of which escalated from verbal disputes into physical altercations and
arrests, and eventual court action and the imposition of dispositional terms, raise the spector of a
possible pattern of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and unreliability, and must thus be
considered in detail.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	It is important to note that in each of the two purely verbal disputes, the police arrived after
the disputes had been resolved without deteriorating into a physical clash.  Thus, their overall
security significance is diminished because they differ substantially from the physical disputes.
While there was minor police involvement in both instances, that involvement did not raise the
security significance of the verbal disputes, for Applicant was not arrested.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Under the circumstances,
Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully overcome the
Government's case with respect to allegations 1.d. and 1.e. of the SOR, and those allegations are also
concluded in favor of Applicant.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	The fifth and sixth incidents--the verbal disputes which evolved into physical clashes in
arch 1998--are, in my view, the incidents with the most security significance.  While the eventual
disposition of the incidents included police and court action, an examination of the circumstances
surrounding the conduct of both incidents reveals that it was not as serious as it initially appeared.
The "assault and battery" in the initial incident involved a minor injury resulting from Applicant's
"shouldering" his way past, and bumping into, his then-girlfriend.  No punches were thrown, and
other indicia of violence are absent.  The conduct was more in the nature of an unfortunate accident
rather than an intentional infliction of injury.  The second incident, coming about four weeks later,
was a mutual "assault and battery" involving slapping, with a possible alcohol factor, and the only
injury reported was sustained by Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	After joining the fifth and sixth incidents, the court disposed of them in a manner deemed
appropriate.  While acknowledging the unacceptable nature of domestic assault and battery, the
court, nevertheless, concluded that these incidents were not sufficiently serious to warrant
incarceration.  In a clear signal to Applicant to clean up his conduct, he was ordered to attend the
Batterers' Treatment Program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Applicant's formal rehabilitation began when he actively participated in weekly counseling
sessions for addictive behavior in October 1998, and subsequently participated in group batterers'
counseling.  That counseling seems to have been successful, for Applicant has not been involved in
any similar conduct since the incident in late March 1998.  Applicant married his present wife--the
"victim" in the two 1998 incidents--in July 1998, and the stressors that apparently ignited the earlier
disputes have been minimized, if not eliminated.  As a result, it appears that Applicant has matured
and become more acutely aware of his responsibilities in his conduct with others.  Even though the
rehabilitative efforts may have been court-imposed, I believe that Applicant has taken positive steps
to significantly reduce or eliminate any vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure which
may have existed as a result of his conduct and explosive nature.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Under the circumstances,
Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully overcome the
Government's case with respect to allegations 1.f. and 1.g. of the SOR, and those allegations are also
concluded in favor of Applicant.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	The Government has also alleged a very different type of component as constituting
Applicant's overall pattern of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  In addition to Applicant's verbal disputes and
physical clashes, Applicant's October 1997 security violation has been identified as supporting the
Government's contention.  It is important to note that this incident, standing alone, did not justify
bringing the allegation as a security violation under Criterion K.  The evidence is unrebutted that the
violation did not result in unauthorized disclosure of classified information; was not deliberate, but
rather, inadvertent; and was isolated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	As indicated above, Applicant was also involved in two other security violations in October
1998 and February 1999.  As they are not alleged in the SOR, and Department Counsel has not
moved to amend the SOR to include them, I am unable to base my decision on the two additional
incidents.  Nevertheless, despite the potential seriousness of Applicant's October 1997 security
violation, I do not believe his conduct in that instance increases the "negative" security significance
of Applicant's other alleged conduct.  </FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Under the circumstances, Applicant has, through evidence of
extenuation and explanation, successfully overcome the Government's case with respect to allegation
1.c. of the SOR, and that allegation is also concluded in favor of Applicant.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	I do not take this position lightly, but based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy
v. Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my evaluation of the evidence, and my application of the pertinent
factors and conditions under the Adjudicative Process, I believe that Applicant has mitigated and
overcome the Government's case.  The evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to
Applicant's continued security eligibility and suitability.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	With respect to Criterion J, the Government has established its case.  Criminal conduct by
an applicant for access to classified information encompasses matters within the jurisdiction of the
Department of Defense.  As indicated above, Applicant's two arrests in March 1998 are the incidents
with the most security significance.  The assault and battery in the first incident involved a minor
injury resulting from Applicant's "shouldering" his way past, and bumping into, his then-girlfriend,
with no punches thrown, and no other indicia of violence.  The second incident was a mutual assault
and battery involving slapping, with a possible alcohol factor, and the only injury reported was that
sustained by Applicant.  Such conduct clearly falls within Criminal Conduct DC 2 and DC 3.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">	Notwithstanding the disqualifying nature of the criminal conduct, it is also clear, in this
instance, there are at least two conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  Applicant married
his present wife--the "victim" in the two 1998 incidents--in July 1998, and the stressors that
apparently ignited the earlier disputes have been minimized, if not eliminated.  Furthermore, it
appears Applicant has matured and, as a result of his continuing active participation in several
counseling programs directed to addictive behavior and batterers' counseling, become more acutely
aware of his responsibilities in his conduct with others.  That counseling seems to have been
successful, for Applicant has not been involved in any further similar conduct since the incident in
late March 1998.  Thus, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (MC) 4 and MC 5 seem to apply.
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Under the circumstances, Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation,
successfully overcome the Government's case with respect to allegation 2.a. of the SOR, and that
allegation is also concluded in favor of Applicant.</FONT><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"></FONT></P>
