</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,  as amended by
Change 3, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated January 14, 1997, to the Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	On February 13, 1997,  Applicant, at that time acting<EM> pro se</EM>,  responded to the allegations
set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned accordingly to this
Administrative </P>

<P>Judge on March 18, 1997, and on March 24, 1997, a hearing was scheduled for April 10, 1997. At
the hearing held as scheduled, four Government exhibits (Gov Ex) and four Applicant exhibits (App
Ex) were admitted into evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant and two witnesses for
the Applicant.  A transcript of the hearing was received by this office on April 18, 1997.  </P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the allegations listed in the SOR, with the exception of subparagraph 1.
(e).  Applicant admits he was charged with Driving under the Influence (DUI) and that he was under
the influence at the time of his arrest, but denies he was driving the vehicle at the time of the arrest.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	After a thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the 
same, I make the following findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is 36 years old and is a graphic art illustrator who currently holding a secret
security clearance. He has worked for Company A since November 1992.<A HREF="97-0003.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Applicant does a very
good job at work, and is very professional in handling the job. He produces a very good work
product.  Each year he has received a merit raise.  He has never drank at work, never reported to
work drunk, and never drank at lunch.   </P>

<P>	Applicant had his first drink while he was in high school, in the mid 1970's. [Tr. 41]
Applicant was first arrested in December 1985.  He had been at a Christmas party drinking and
dancing.  When leaving the party, he saw some individuals grab his cousin. Applicant went to his
cousin's assistance.  The individuals were police officers and Applicant was arrested.  Applicant was
charged with public intoxication and resisting arrest. Applicant forfeited a cash bond of
approximately $200.00.</P>

<P>	In January 1987 Applicant had been out drinking with a friend.  His friend's driving attracted
the attention of the police. While the police were in pursuit of the car the friend stopped and ran
away from the car. Applicant stayed in the car. Applicant was not driving but the police lied and said
he was driving.  Applicant was charged with DUI, but was acquitted.<A HREF="97-0003.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> </P>

<P>	In November 1990 Applicant had been out drinking and playing pool.  He was arrest for DUI
when he drove home from the pool hall.  He pled guilty to DUI, paid a $300.00 fine, had his license
suspended for 90 days, and attended a highway intoxication seminar.  </P>

<P>	On January 1, 1992, Applicant had attended a New Year's Eve party.  He was drinking at the
party.  He decided to leave the party and go home.  He knew he was too drunk to drive so he chose
to sleep in his vehicle. (Gov Ex 4) Applicant was charged with DUI. Applicant pled guilty to public
intoxication.  Applicant paid a $250.00 fine plus court costs and was sentenced to one year
probation.</P>

<P>	In April 1996 Applicant was fishing and drinking with friends.  His friends left him off at
his car. Applicant realized he was too drunk to drive home so he got into the back seat and went to
sleep. (Gov Ex 4) Applicant was arrested for public intoxication and for carrying a pistol without
a permit (CPWP).  The public intoxication charge was dropped and Applicant was found guilty of
CPWP.  He was fined $250.00 plus court costs, sentenced to 30 days in jail, suspended, and given
one year unsupervised probation. </P>

<P>	 On October 21, 1996, Applicant made a sworn statement. In that statement Applicant said
his drinking habits have remained the same since 1988.  (Gov Ex 4) In the same statement, he stated
that he did not believe he had a drinking problem.  This intention was to continue drinking once or
twice a month.  At the hearing Applicant stated it was his current intention to refrain from all
drinking. Applicant has gone to AA twice.  Applicant plans to refrain from all drinking, because
drinking interferes with his well-being and his livelihood. [Tr. 60] Applicant wants to stay away
from alcohol because it has always gotten him into trouble in the past. Applicant admits that during
the last four incidents he had consumed alcohol to excess prior to the arrests.<A HREF="97-0003.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> [Tr. 69]  </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in
making the overall common sense determination  required.  Each adjudicative decision must also
include an assessment of the seriousness, recency, frequency and motivation for an applicant's
conduct; the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with
knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; the age of the applicant; the absence or
presence of rehabilitation, the potential for coercion or duress, and the probability that the conduct
will or will not recur in the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section F.3. and Enclosure 2.  Because
each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the
factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. 
oreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a
recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable
behavior. </P>

<P>	 Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following
adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</P>

<P><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>	(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,
fighting. . .</P>

<P>	(4) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</P>

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>	(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>

<P>	In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense determination required, the
Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions which have a reasonable and
logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must
make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions under the Directive include
consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Burden of Proof<STRONG></U></CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as
a security concern under the Directive, then the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial
evidence  in explanation, mitigation, or extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that
despite the existence of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgement,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of
confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times
and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs,
then there exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude toward security
rules and regulations.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of the Applicant,  this Judge concludes that
the Government has established its case with regard to criterion G. On reviewing the corresponding
mitigating factors (MF), there is a sufficient pattern to his alcohol-related incidents and his problem
is too recent to favorably apply MC 1 or 2. </P>

<P>	Over a 12-year period Applicant has five alcohol-related arrests.  Prior to four of these arrests
Applicant had drunk alcohol to excess.  Applicant first realized there was a problem when he
received the SOR in February 1997.  This was the first time that his alcohol problem was laid out
all at once. Once he reviewed the SOR, he decided he should stop drinking and go to AA.  He has
attended AA twice.  </P>

<P>	His realization that alcohol is a problem for him and his abstinence from all alcohol since </P>

<P>February 1997, is regarded as a positive change in behavior supportive of sobriety. (See MC 3).  But
this realization came only after the SOR had been received and Applicant was aware that his job
might be affected by his drinking.  Whether or not an applicant has reformed, depends on recognition
and acknowledgment of his alcohol problem, and demonstration by conduct over a measurable
period of time that he  is committed to his recovery. Attendance at two AA meetings is insufficient
to demonstrate a strong commitment and a change in lifestyle toward the use of alcohol. There is no
evidence of Applicant understanding the AA program, has become involved in the steps of the
program, has gotten a sponsor, or comprehends all that is involved in AA participation.</P>

<P>	As recently as October 21, 1996, Applicant showed little insight into his alcohol problem,
as evidenced by his statement that alcohol was not a problem for him and that he intended to
continue drinking once or twice a month. His efforts in reform are too recent to overcome his history
of drug abuse.</P>

<P>	The absence of any alcohol related incidents at his company are to his credit, but it does not
mandate the grant of a clearance.  The responsibilities to safeguard classified information do not
cease at the end of the work day.  At this juncture, it is too soon to tell whether AA will provide a
viable support network for him in his recovery or to conclude that his alcohol dependence is safely
behind him.  He has attended AA only twice.</P>

<P>	With less than a year of sustained sobriety and his minimal involvement with AA, it is still
to soon to draw convincing conclusions that Applicant is a safe risk to avert any recurrence of
alcohol abuse in the foreseeable future.  Applicant's commitment must be more than a declaration
that he has stopped using alcohol and that he will go to AA in the future. So, while Applicant is to
be commended and encouraged in his efforts at seeking professional help for his alcohol problems,
he needs more time to persuasively season his commitments to stay sober and away from alcohol
abuse in the future. </P>

<P>	For the present time, it is sufficient to conclude that Applicant's mitigation efforts, though
encouraging are not of sufficient strength and endurance to enable him to absorb the Government's
pressing security concerns associated with his past abuses of alcohol. </P>

<P>	Accordingly, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. are resolved against him.
Subparagraph 1.g. is resolved in Applicant's favor for that allegation alleged that he continues to
consume alcohol. Applicant stopped consuming alcohol in February 1997.</P>
