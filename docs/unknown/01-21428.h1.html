<P>The Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, as evidenced by a foreclosure on her house in 1996, resulting in $5,709 in past due 
indebtedness.  More recently, since September 2000, she had a $828 credit card debt that was also more than 180 days past due.  The Applicant paid her credit 
card debt in September of 2001.  She was also less than candid in answering question 35 on her March 2000 Security Clearance Application (SCA).  She failed 
to list her 1996 foreclosure.  However, she did truthfully answer questions 38 and 39 as to her past due indebtedness.  Her credit card debt was not 90 or 180 
days past due when she executed her SCA.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 8, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about October 30, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on January 30, 2003.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received her copy on February 6, 2003, and Applicant's Response was received on March 3, 2003.  The case was received by 
the undersigned for resolution on March 21, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's financial difficulties and personal conduct militate against 
the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 48 years 
of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant and her former spouse defaulted on their mortgage in September of 1996 (Government Exhibit (GX) 6 at page 1, and GX 9 at page 2).  As a 
result of this foreclosure, they incurred $5,709 in indebtedness that became past due (<EM>id</EM>).  In her February 2001 sworn statement, she avers that she was unaware 
of any such past due indebtedness, "as I have heard nothing more from the mortgage company" (GX 9 at page 2).  In October 2002, she avers that the mortgage  
company "has been covered for their loss," but offers nothing to support this averment which is contrary to her July 2002 credit report (GX 6).  I must assume 
this past due debt is still outstanding.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  In September of 2000, the Applicant became more than 180 days past due for a credit card debt in the amount of $828 (GX 6 at page 2, and GX 9 at page 
3).  In September of 2001, she closed her credit card account, after the creditor accepted her offer of settlement; and as such, has no more past due indebtedness 
on this account (Response at pages 4 and 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. and 2.b.  In answering question 35 on her March 2000 SCA, the Applicant knowingly and wilfully failed to disclose her 1996 foreclosure (GX 4 at page 8).  
The question posited is straight forward, "In the last 7 years have you had <STRONG>any property</STRONG> repossessed for any reason" (<EM>id</EM>, emphasis supplied).  The Applicant 
avers, unconvincingly, "Guess I never really thought that walking away from my house was in fact repossession" (GX 3 at page 3).  This is not believable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In answering questions 38 and 39 on her SCA, the Applicant was truthful (GX 4 at page 8).  She avers, "I didn't think I had any debt that was that old" (GX 9 at 
page 4).  She is correct, as her debt did not become more than 90 or 180 days past due until about 90 or 180 days after executing her SCA; i.e., she was current 
with this indebtedness on or about the time she executed the SCA.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant avers, "I am a good person, ask anyone," but offers little, if anything, to support her prayer (Response).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. The deliberate omission, concealment; or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications . . . ;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guidelines E (personal conduct), and F (financial considerations); which establishes doubt about a person's 
judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to 
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unacceptable personal conduct is conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all 
times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's financial difficulties, the Applicant has a history of not meeting her financial obligations, as evidenced by a 1996 foreclosure 
on her house, and a past due debt to a credit card company.  In February of 2001, when she executed her sworn statement, the Applicant was put on notice that 
her financial situation was of concern to the Government.  It is laudable that she has taken care of one of her two past due debts, but, in the intervening two 
years, she has done little to address $5,709 foreclosure that her July 2002 credit report notes as still being outstanding.  Simply stated, she has not demonstrated 
that she is financially stable; and as such, Guideline F is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to her personal conduct, the Applicant was less than candid when she answered question 35 on her March 2000 SCA.  The question posited is clear and 
straight forward, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"In the last 7 years have you had <STRONG>any property</STRONG> repossessed for any reason" (GX 4 at page 8, emphasis supplied).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  A foreclosure of one's 
house is clearly a repossession of one's property.  Guideline E is also found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding her financial considerations, and her personal conduct.  The 
Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and F, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not met her ultimate 
burden of persuasion under Guidelines E and F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
