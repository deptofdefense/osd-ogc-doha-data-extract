</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts he accrued in connection with medical care he received and was initially assumed to be covered by his medical 
insurance and debts incurred with a business he started in 1998 and failed financially despite all of his funding support.  Unable to address his debts for the 
ensuing three years due to the unanticipated medical complications of his spouse (whose short term medical disability expired), he has since paid all but two of  
his debts with the aid of a loan from his father-in-law, who he is repaying at an agreed monthly rate.  Applicant by his good-faith payment efforts mitigates 
security concerns associated with his delinquent debts, and he successfully refutes allegations of falsification of his security clearance application (SF-86) by a 
demonstrated misunderstanding of the age of his debts.  Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 27, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 12, 2003, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2004, and after a granted 
continuance of the first scheduled hearing, was rescheduled for hearing on April 28, 2004.  A hearing was convened on April 28, 2004, for the purpose of 
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the 
Government's case consisted of nine exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including himself) and 18  exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on 
ay 13, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have incurred numerous delinquent debts which he is unable to pay based on his reported negative monthly income: 
He is alleged to have incurred 11 delinquent debts which exceed $18,000.00 in total and currently reports a $430.00 negative monthly remainder. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guidelines E and J, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of November 20, 2000 by omitting his delinquent 
debts over 90 days delinquent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covered by Guideline  F.  He claimed the debts were the result of business losses 
incurred in connection with his financial support of a small business he operated between June 1998 and early 1999.  He claimed he continued to operate the 
business even after it began to experience small losses in the hope he could make it a success like his other small businesses.  Applicant claimed to have 
enrolled in a credit-counseling-program, which he expected to use to satisfy his delinquent debts.  Applicant attributed his mushrooming debts to both his 
increasing business losses and his wife's illness, which was followed by loss of her short-term disability insurance and income loss attributable to her disability.  
 Applicant denied any intentional falsification of his February 1999 SF-86, claiming he was not aware of his having debts at the time that were more than 90 
days delinquent; even though he admitted to having severe economic difficulties resulting from his emerging business failure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old industrial security specialist for a defense contractor who seeks an upgrade of his security clearance to top secret status.  The 
allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has held a security clearance with the same firm since 1986 through a series of corporate mergers and acquisitions.  In June 1998, he established a 
business on the side that specialized in comedy entertainment in his local community.  For the year and a half he operated his comedy business he struggled 
financially with it to keep it operational  before succumbing to poor business attendance and finally closing it in January 2000.  During the months he operated 
the business in 1998 and 1999, he covered fixed overhead, staffing and entertainers expenses with his own money.  Most of the incurred expenses he covered 
with credit cards.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had operated his comedy business for only 18 weeks when he was notified on short notice by the hotel he was renting space from that it wished to use 
the space for other purposes.  Because Applicant had already booked performers for scheduled performances, he was stuck paying their agreed fees.  Over the 
course of the ensuing year, he changed local hotels once more before settling in with his last one.  After successfully negotiating with his landlord in late 1999 
to hold a New Years eve show (in December 1999), Applicant's show enticed much fewer patrons than he had anticipated and failed to break even with his 
expense outlays.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Most of Applicant's delinquent debts covered in the SOR involved credit card accounts he ran up during his ill fated comedy  business.  Three were unrelated 
and involved medical services he contracted for in 1995 and 1996 in the belief they would be covered by his medical insurance (creditors 1.g and 1.h).  When 
his expected health insurance carrier did not cover these medical debts (approximating $1,764.00 and $102.00, respectively), he resisted paying them himself.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides his comedy business-related and earlier medical debts, Applicant incurred a major  loan indebtedness in 1999 on a new car lease (<EM>compare </EM>exs. 4 and<EM> </EM>I).  
When he could no longer afford to stay up with the monthly lease payments following his business failure, he told the leasing  company he was returning their 
vehicle.  This he did around June 2000.  After the leasing company sold the vehicle it advised Applicant there could be a deficiency for as much as $7,000.00, 
maybe less.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has also been responsible for child support for his daughter from his former marriage.  His ex-wife claimed arrearage at one time.  Disputing the 
amount of his arrearage and the length of time he would be responsible for her, he, nonetheless, accepted paycheck deductions to defray the arrearage.  
Applicant continues to be responsible for arrearage but not current child support any longer: She is 22 years of age.  Paycheck deductions for his arrearage are 
deducted at the rate of $160.00 a month.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant met his current spouse (W) at his employment where she was also employed in 2002.  W had begun to experience unknown medical symptoms by 
April 2002, which could not be immediately diagnosed.  In June 2002, Applicant married W.  Four days after their marriage, W experienced intestinal blockage 
and almost died.  Shortly thereafter, she went into surgery and was diagnosed with Crohn's disease: a digestive tract disorder that is accompanied by symptoms 
of intestinal blockage, vomiting and aches in the joints (R.T., at 72-73).  Over the course of the year, W's symptoms became so debilitating she could no longer 
hold down her job.  She was placed on short term disability status, which entitled her to receive 60 per cent of her pay benefits.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With W's benefits reduced, Applicant assumed greater responsibility for taking care of his family's financial needs.  By August 2002, her condition has 
stabilized to the point where she was able to return to work.   About this time Applicant's sister died suddenly.  This required Applicant's financial assistance 
with the funeral expenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January  2003, W developed medical complications which required her taking leave from work again.  With W still receiving her short term disability 
payments, Applicant and W for the first two months were able to keep up with their current debts without incurring any monthly deficits.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2003, Applicant and W received notice from W's short term disability carrier that it would no longer fund her short term disability.  With no 
supplemental income whatsoever from W, Applicant was forced to assume all of the financial responsibility for running his household.  Because he was 
running a monthly remainder deficit of around $430.00 as the result of W's inability to work, he could not do any more at the time but keep his new debts 
current, which he did, even while incurring a $430.00 a month remainder deficit.  With the existing uncertainty about W, he could not be more specific with the 
DSS agent who interviewed him in March 2003 about paying on his old debts (then in excess of $19,000.00).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering consumer credit counseling (CCC) in July 2003, Applicant declined it, in part due to the $500.00 up-front charge CCC required to administer 
his creditor payments (ex. 33). Applicant turned to his father-in-law who offered to loan him money to pay off his old debts.  Applicant accepted a $20,000.00 
loan from his father-in-law ($1,500.00 of which was held back for emergency) in August 2003 to pay off his old debts (R.T., at 97-98).  With the loan funds, he 
paid off all but a few of his delinquent debts.  He documents paying off the following creditors in August and September 2003: creditors 1.a (in an agreed  lump 
sum payment of $1,300.00), 1.b (in full) 1.c (in an agreed  lump sum payment of $993.00), 1.d (in an agreed lump sum payment of $1,440.92), 1.e (in an agreed 
lump sum payment of $1,169.49), 1.f (in full), 1.h (in full), and 1.i (in full).  Applicant, in turn, has been paying off the father-in-law's loan at the rate of 
$424.00 a month (R.T., at 98-99).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant reached a compromise settlement in July 2003 with the leasing company (creditor 1.j) that took back his leased vehicle in June 2000.  After being 
surprised to receive a $7,365.00 deficiency notice he called the collection agent for creditor 1.j and worked out a $3,000.00 cash settlement with them.  With the 
benefit of his father-in-law's $20,000.00 loan (several days later), he called the collection agent back to implement his settlement, the agent declined to accept it 
(R.T., at 93).  Applicant then called creditor in1.j August 2003 and worked out a $4,700.00 settlement with them, with $3,000.00 to be wired immediately, and 
the remaining $1,700.00 to be worked out later.  Applicant wired the $3,000.00 as promised only to be later confronted with  a larger demand from creditor 1.j: 
first in November 2003 for the entire $4,365.00 balance (reflecting Applicant's $3,000.00 payment), and later (in February 2004)  for $2,200.00 (<EM>see</EM> ex. I; R.T., 
at 93).  Applicant has continued to work with creditor 1.j on persuading them to stick to this original settlement arrangement, but has not as yet made his final 
payment on the debt (R.T., at 134).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides the money he still owes to creditor 1.j for services provided in 1992 (R.T., at 89). Applicant is still in debt to creditor 1.g for the $1,764.00 balance that 
the insurance company declined to cover (R.T., at 134).  Applicant continues to dispute this amount and provides no time table as to when he might pay this 
debt that still appears on his credit report.  He has been in touch with the creditor's collection agent recently and asked them to resubmit their medical claim to 
the responsible insurance company (R.T., at 90).   At present, he is still waiting to hear back from the collection agent for creditor 1.g.  If the carrier will not 
cover this claim, he is committed to somehow paying it himself.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's most recent financial statement reflects slight improvement in his net monthly disposable income: from $3,284.00 in March 2003 to $3,359.00 in 
April 2004 (<EM>compare </EM>exs. 2 with J).  While he continues to have his child support arrearage deducted from his paycheck (around $160.00 a month), his overall 
deductions have been reduced by a little over a $100.00 a month (R.T., at 103-04).  He now can count on a net positive monthly remainder of $1,080.00.  This 
should enable him to take care of the balance owing on his deficiency with the leasing agency he returned his car to.  The extra monthly disposable money 
should also enable him to continue to repay his father-in-law's $20,000.00 loan at the rate of the agreed on $424 a month, which he does not list as a monthly 
debt on his April 2004 financial statement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked to complete an SF-86 in February 1999, Applicant answered in the negative to question 39's inquiry whether he had any delinquencies over 90 days.  
Applicant attributed his omissions to uncertainty over any of his debts had reached the level of 90 days delinquent by February 1999.  While he admits to being 
aware of accumulating debts from his fledgling comedy business, he did not know they were as yet 90 days late when he answered his security questionnaire. 
Because he was continuing to pay on these business-related debts that accounted for most of his bad debts, he considered them to be still in non-delinquent 
status in February 1999.   As for his earlier medical debts (creditors 1.g through 1.i), Applicant assures that creditors 1.h and 1.i were not reported on  the 1997 
credit report he looked at in anticipation of purchasing his motorcycle.  Were they he would have paid them at the time, given their small amounts (R.T., at 
138).  While he did note the creditor 1.g hospital debt on his 1997 credit report, he didn't think he was responsible for the debt, and still doesn't.  He believed 
his medical insurance carrier was both responsible for the debt and the party taking care of the debt (R.T., at 139).  Applicant's explanations reflect credible  
interpretations of the facts and circumstances available to him at the time and are accepted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant did not use appropriate due diligence in looking into the status of his debts before providing an unqualified  negative answer to question 39 of 
his SF-86, it is less than clear when Applicant's business related debts actually went into delinquent status.   Only two of the consumer debts (represented by 
creditors 1.a. and1.b) are listed as being charged off before February 1999, and  Applicant's credit report does not provide ready answers as to when the 
remaining debts first became delinquent.  Considering that Applicant only started his business in June 1998, it remains conceivable that his remaining consumer 
debts did not reach 90 day delinquent status before December 1998, or later.   Neither the timing of his business-related debts nor the circumstances 
surrounding his omission are clear enough to draw inferences he knowingly and willfully falsified his SF-86 in omitting his business related debts declared   As 
for those two consumer debts that were charged off in 1998 (creditors 1.a and 1.b), Applicant also attributes uncertainty over whether they were actually 
considered delinquent by the creditors, given his continuing payments on these accounts.  Applicant's explanations for omitting both his consumer debts and his 
medical debts (the latter based on his claimed understanding they were being handled by his insurance carrier) are accepted as truthful, even if they do not 
reflect due diligence actions on his part. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded by past and present facility security managers of his company. His immediate supervisor credits him with reliable and 
conscientious contributions.  Coworkers past and present who have worked with him commend him for his professionalism, solid contributions to the many 
security-related missions he has been assigned to, and honesty about keeping his promises and maintaining his professional and family commitments (<EM>see</EM> exs. 
28 and 29).   A former associate (B) of his in his unsuccessful comedy business praises Applicant for his determination and continued funding of the business 
during its ongoing struggles, before finally  exhausting his own resources and closing the business by financial necessity (<EM>see</EM> ex. 27).  B stresses Applicant's 
steadfast commitment to providing for his wife's medical needs (providing around the clock care while carrying out his security responsibilities with his 
company), even after her insurance was canceled and he was forced to assume more of the financial burdens.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's performance appraisals credit him generally with either meeting or exceeding expectations in the established criteria. (<EM>see </EM>exs. 18 through 20).  In 
recent years he has received both monetary and performance awards in recognition of his performance and contributions to his company's security mission (<EM>see</EM> 
exs. 15 through 17). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debt between 1995 and 1999: some medically related which his insurance carried has not covered, but most related 
to his struggling comedy business that ultimately failed following a series of operational and audience setbacks. Altogether, Applicant accumulated over 
$19,000.00 of medical and business debts.  The Government's security concerns center on the amount of delinquent debt he compiled between 1995 and 1999 
and his ensuing omissions of these debts from his pertinent answers to his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relying on his medical insurance to pay his medical bills from creditors 1.h and 1.i, Applicant did not address these debts for many years.   Most of his other 
debts arose out of his financial support of his struggling comedy business.  His only covered debt represents a deficiency due and owing on a leased car he 
returned to the leasing agency in 2000.  Each of these debts became delinquent and were ultimately charged off by the creditors.  On this record, , two of the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 
(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are attributable to a variety of extenuating circumstances.  His covered medical debts that were written off between 1995 and 1999 involve 
debts for medical services provided by Applicant and assumed wrongly by the latter to be covered by his medical insurance.  Most of his other debts involve 
credit card debts associated with his failed comedy business. While  the deficiency on his leased car arose from a deficiency that survived the leasing company's 
public sale of the vehicle.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Extenuation of Applicant's debts is not enough in and of itself to overcome the adverse trust implications associated with his accumulating so many delinquent 
debts without any evidence of addressing them until he received the SOR.  After failing with a counseling service to complete a payment plan, he turned to his 
father-in-law for assistance.  His father-in-law responded positively with a $20,000.00 loan to pay off his old debts.  Applicant used the money to pay off all but 
his car lease deficiency and old medical debt: Negotiations with these creditors continue.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant mitigates active security concerns associated with his debt problems by his payment of most of his covered debts.  Excepted is creditor 1.g, which he 
still claims is the insurance company's responsibility, and on which he is waiting to hear back from the creditor's collection agent on its re-submission of the 
claim to the insurance agency.  Applicant is also working on resolving the balance of his deficiency debt with creditor 1.j.  On this debt, he is working on 
persuading the creditor to honor their earlier $4,700.00 settlement, which includes Applicant's credited $3,000.00 payment made in reliance on his version of 
the settlement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That Applicant is responsible for paying back his father-in-law is not indicative of any continuing security concern, so long as the debt does not become 
delinquent (which it currently is not).  Applicant has the demonstrated resources to pay off this debt with his current circumstances and persuades he will 
continue to satisfy this debt in the regular course of business according to the loose terms he arranged with his father-in-law. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Appraising Applicant's extenuating circumstances with respect to all of his covered debts,  Applicant may take advantage of MC 3 (conditions largely beyond 
the person's control) of the Adjudicative Guidelines to extenuate his debt delinquencies.  He may also avail himself of the mitigation benefits of MC 6 (initiated 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) based on his repayment efforts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts and the good- faith efforts he demonstrated in satisfying his debts when he and 
his wife were able to with the aid of his father-in-law, favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.k as to the allegations 
governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification Concerns</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant's documented omissions of his covered delinquent debts from the SF-86 he completed in February 1999.  
His omissions are, however, attributable to his mistaken uncertainty over whether his debts (which he had been paying on) were actually 90 days delinquent at 
the time of his completing his SF-86.  While Applicant with his experience in industrial security could certainly have been more diligent about checking on  the 
status of his debts (knowing as he did he was in financial trouble), his judgment lapses are not enough to impute knowing and wilful falsification under either 
Guideline E or Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Were the standard for knowing and wilful falsification in a Guideline E case a reasonable man test (as the Government urges in its closing summation), 
falsification might well be attributed to Applicant.  For as a security professional who has filled out many SF-86 forms before and knows the importance of 
candor, he could have been expected to use more due diligence in checking the status of his debts before answering no to a question that asks him about his 
debts over 90 days delinquent.  But while the Appeal Board has questioned an applicant's explanations at times as either contradictory, unsupported by the 
evidence, or just plain untenable (a variation of unreasonableness), it has not adopted a reasonable man test as the standard for determining  falsification.  A 
reasonable man test is essentially a standard of care designed to determine whether negligence or departures of good judgment occurred.  Falsification, by 
contrast,  involves knowing and wilful conduct that tests a person's honesty and requires evidence of specific intent, and generally motive.  Proof of 
falsification requires more than poor judgment or unreasonable assumptions.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  <EM>Cf. United States v. Chapin</EM>, 515 F.2d 1274, 1283-84 (DC Cir. 1975); 
<EM>United States Steinhilber</EM>, 484 F.2d 386, 389-90 (8th Cir. 1973); <EM>United States v. Diogo</EM>, 320 F.2d 898, 905 (2d Cir. 1963).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant's explanations of his omissions (misunderstanding the age of his debts and his obligations to his earlier medical creditors) are persuasive enough to 
avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission.  There being no misconduct substantiated, no need to show extenuation or mitigation arises.  <EM>Cf. </EM>ISCR Case 
No. 02-13568 (February 13, 2004).  While Applicant's efforts lack due diligences inquiries of the state of his debts,  his efforts reveal enough mistaken reliance 
on the unknown state of his debts to enable him to refute the allegations of falsification of his SF-86 covered in subparagraphs 2.a and 3.a (governed by 
Guidelines E and J, respectively). </SPAN></P>
