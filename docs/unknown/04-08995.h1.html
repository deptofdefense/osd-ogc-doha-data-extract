<P>On October 18, 2004,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its 
preliminary determination that Applicant was not eligible for assignment to information systems positions designated ADP I/II.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges security 
concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). It alleges that Applicant's mother (&para; 1.a), sister (&para; 1.b), and two brothers (&para; 1.c) are citizens of Taiwan currently 
residing in Taiwan. It also alleges that  Applicant has a third brother (&para; 1.d) who is a citizen and resident of Singapore. It concludes by alleging that Applicant 
traveled to Taiwan in 1998 and 2002 to visit family members (&para; 1.e) and that he traveled to Singapore in 2002 (&para; 1.f).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 50-year-old software technical tester who has worked for the same defense contractor since June 2003. His employer manages two U.S. 
Department of Defense (DoD) contracts to conduct independent software testing.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> His current position does not call for access to secret information or 
classified information, but for testing software which may contain lab data or medical information. His position requires ADP II clearance because the data and 
information is derived from the military and may be maintained on secured or military facilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Born in Taipai, Taiwan, he worked for a private transportation company in Taiwan as an analyst after undergraduate school. In that position, he analyzed data 
and defined capacities for cargo. He also performed compulsory military service. In 1983, he entered the United States on a student visa. As a visiting student, 
he earned a master's degree and completed a doctoral program, but did not complete his dissertation. Instead, in 1988, he accepted employment within the 
technology field.  In 1990, he became a permanent resident. On October 10, 1996, he became a naturalized United States citizen. In the process he renounced 
his Taiwanese citizenship and let his Taiwanese passport expire.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Today, his only citizenship is that of the United States and he travels on a United States 
passport without incident.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is married to a United States citizen who works for the U.S. federal government.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The couple has two children. Their daughter is a high school 
student who is active with her school swim team and her state youth orchestra. Their son recently entered middle school. The family has resided in the same 
area since Applicant started working in 1988. Applicant has bought the home in which his family resides; he also owns stock, including stock in his employer's 
company, and some mutual funds maintained in the United States.  His 401(k) retirement fund and his IRA are both maintained in the United States, as well. 
Applicant has no foreign investments or property. A future interest through inheritance of a house in Taiwan has been renounced in favor of his sister in 
Taiwan.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's mother and four siblings live abroad and are his only foreign contacts.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> His mother, a sister, and two brothers are citizens of Taiwan and are 
financially self-sufficient. His mother is 85 years old, in declining health, and has a pacemaker. She has undergone a number of hospitalizations and was 
recuperating from a broken leg in 2005. A lifelong housewife and homemaker, she has never been involved in political activities and has no connection with a 
foreign government. She owns, and lives in, a four-bedroom condominium. Although she receives a minimal government stipend akin to Social Security, 
amounting to about $100 a month, she lives off the proceeds of her late husband's estate, including approximately $2,000 a month in rental income from rental 
properties.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant speaks with his mother about once a week by telephone.  These calls generally last 10 to 20 minutes in duration and usually concern 
issues of health and welfare.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Living with her is Applicant's 55-year-old sister.  Disabled by polio since infancy, she is cared for by her mother.  Like her mother, she has never been active in 
political activities and she has no connection with a foreign government, except for about $100 a month in disability income.  When Applicant's mother is 
incapacitated or infirm, mother and daughter receive care from Applicant's brothers living in Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One of Applicant's brothers in Taiwan retired from his position as a librarian at a local university<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> over a decade ago. He is not involved in political activities 
and his only connection to a foreign government is his receipt of a state pension. The other brother retired four years ago from a private bank, from which he 
receives a pension from a privately controlled pension fund.  This brother is not involved in political activities and has no connection with any foreign 
government.  Each brother has two grown children. None of the children work for the government, although the male children each performed two weeks of 
compulsory military service. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A third brother lives in Singapore. After receiving his education in England, this brother accepted a job offer from a private Singapore engineering firm. He 
subsequently became a citizen of Singapore. He was most recently involved in a project regarding the expansion of Singapore's airport for his company. 
Because his children are grown and graduated from graduate school, he may soon retire. This brother similarly refrains from political activity and has no 
association with any foreign governments. Applicant's contact with his brothers is maintained by telephone, usually every two to three weeks.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant describes his family as close.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In the past eight years, Applicant has visited his family in both Taiwan and Singapore.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> In 1998, he visited Taiwan.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> 
Accompanied by an old college friend who is a current co-worker in the U.S., the two men visited their families in Taiwan. After a two week stay, Applicant 
returned to the U.S. He returned in July 2002, accompanied by his family.  They took the opportunity to visit Applicant's third brother in Singapore during a 
three-day layover, then proceeded to visit his mother and other siblings in Taiwan for two weeks. While in Taiwan, the family stayed with his mother.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> In 
September 2004, Applicant again visited his mother for two weeks.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> At the time of the hearing, a family trip to Taiwan was being planned for August 2005; 
Applicant had no plans, however, to visit Singapore in the foreseeable future.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the exception of $100 sent to his sister for Chinese New Year, Applicant sends no money or support to his family abroad. His mother has no significant 
living expenses and lives off her late husband's private real estate investments.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Her children, except for Applicant, have future interests in her private real 
estate holdings. His brothers in Taiwan receive good retirements and, with their children grown and educated, have no significant expenses. His brother in 
Singapore has a professional's income and similarly has grown and educated children. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At issue are Appellant's contacts with family members living in two countries, Taiwan and Singapore. The majority of his contacts are in Taiwan. Most directly 
related to this case is Taiwan,  a stable democracy with a strong and well-developed economy. The crime rate is considered low and tourists are mostly advised 
against the vice trades and markets.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> As a democratic state, and as a nation included among those states actively collecting economic information and 
conducting industrial espionage, Taiwan has been thoroughly assayed.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Singapore is a small, stable, highly developed Parliamentary Republic which, in recent years, has attracted the attention of terrorists, Al Quaeda, and indigenous 
Islamic militant groups, drawn to its religiously and ethnically diverse population, geography, and wealth.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The government, however, generally respects 
human rights, although instances in which limitations to individual citizen's private rights were abridged occurred as the government deals with espionage, 
terrorism, narcotics, and organized crime.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for 
. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the 
person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security."<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the personnel security 
guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security 
clearance."<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> Each eligibility determination must be a fair, impartial, and commonplace decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the 
whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Regulation.<EM><A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age

changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DoD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in DoD Directive 5220.6 before any final unfavorable access determination may be 
made.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> In security clearance cases, the Government initially must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify 
the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor 
of the national security."<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to sensitive positions.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, . . . and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, 
are (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the 
compromise of classified information."<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> A disqualifying condition (DC), such as DC 1, may arise when an "immediate family member</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, or a person to whom 
the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">."<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Applicant's mother, sister, and two brothers 
live in and are citizens of Taiwan, and a third brother lives in and is a citizen of Singapore.  I conclude DC 1 is established. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC) may apply when a condition invoking disqualification arises.  Specifically, MC 1 may apply if these is "a determination that the 
immediate family member(s), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question would not constitute an unacceptable security risk.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> Moreover, MC 5 may apply where 
foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has offered evidence to support a determination that his mother and his siblings do not constitute an unacceptable security risk. The evidence 
demonstrates that none are agents of a foreign power, or politically inclined. Moreover, they are financially independent and free of dependence upon their 
states of allegiance.  Applicant's mother is a life-long homemaker caring for a dependent daughter who has been disabled since infancy. Although both receive a 
nominal sum from the government, for social security and disability, respectively, the combined amount of approximately $200 a month is dwarfed by their 
privately derived, property rental income of around $2,000 a month.  Two of Applicant's brothers are products of private enterprise.  One is retired and  
affording his retirement through a privately held corporate retirement fund; the other is nearing retirement from a private engineering firm with the prospect of a 
similarly private retirement stipend. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is true that a third brother, retired from academe, is supporting his retirement on a state sanctioned retirement fund. That fact, however, does not necessarily 
indicate that he is dependent on those funds. Like his siblings, he apparently has a future share in the two condominium homes his mother inherited from her 
late husband, a private educator and entrepreneur. That legacy can safeguard his future. Moreover, inasmuch as he helps with his mother's care, it can be 
assumed that he can also rely upon her good graces should he ever face a pension-less future. That bond between mother and child, and indeed, the closeness of 
the family overall, would more than likely safeguard him as well. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's depiction of his family abroad paints a portrait of a family quietly living out of the spotlights. Like characters from Thackeray or Galsworthy, they 
are comfortably living on the upper edge of the middle class; neither dependent upon the state, nor so affluent as to inspire notoriety. As such, they are not 
likely to be affected by government influence or held out as subjects of even subtle duress. Indeed, Applicant thus far has been able to visit his family with some 
regularity without bringing attention to either himself his relations. His mother has been free to visit her son in the United States with the same results. Despite 
their interactions, all concerned have been able to conduct their private lives without interference, notoriety, or comment. Therefore, I find that Applicant's 
family members abroad do not pose an unacceptable risk, and find that MC 1 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, Applicant has no financial holdings abroad. His wife, his children, his work, his friends, his house, and his investments are solely U.S.-based. 
Currently, the only money he sends out of the country is a token check to his sister for the Chinese New Year. His only future investment was a future interest 
in a share on one of his mother's condominium homes, which he renounced in favor of his sister.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In the utter absence of foreign financial interests, I find that 
C 5 applies.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered Applicant under the "whole person" concept based on the evidence in the record before me. He is a mature, married, father of two U.S.-born 
children, who has made his place in the American mosaic. He is a graduate of a United States university, owns and lives in an American home, and has all of 
his investments - financial, professional, and social - here in the United States. While the United States is his home of preference and allegiance, it does not 
preclude him from remaining an honorable son who monitors his mother's health and well-being and, in the process, maintains a bond with his siblings. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, I have considered the countries at issue.  Taiwan is a multiparty democracy, a U.S. ally, and a major U.S. trading partner. It has a good human rights 
record. Taiwan maintains a large military establishment, with the primary mission of defending itself against the People's Republic of China. It is true that 
Taiwan is an active collector of defense, medical, economic, and computer information through industrial espionage.<A HREF="04-08995.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> However, there is no indication that it 
has used coercive measures against its own citizens, especially in cases where the goal was to extract industrial secrets from relatives living abroad. Indeed, 
given relations between Taiwan and the U.S., the prospect seems as unlikely. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Singapore is a parliamentary republic with a strong economy and a solid record for individual human rights. It is true that it also has a track record of 
suspending some private rights in its pursuit of certain groups and miscreants, but there is no indication that it seems to gather or extract industrial secrets from 
the West through its citizens or its citizens' kin. Admittedly, both Singapore and Taiwan pose some degree of risk, but none so unacceptable to constitute a 
security risk regarding this Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having concluded that Applicant's family abroad does not pose an unacceptable security risk, that Applicant has no financial ties to any foreign nations, and 
that any risks posed by Taiwan or Singapore, in general, do not so impact these facts and considerations so as to shift the situation into one that actually poses 
an unacceptable risk, I conclude that Applicant is entitled to a favorable eligibility determination.</SPAN></P>

as one of the "most active" practitioners of industrial espionage. Subsequent annual reports, available at www.nacic.gov, ceased identifying the most active 
practitioners of industrial espionage by name. It may well be that the "most active" practitioners can no longer be reliably identified because there are so many. 
In 2000, NACIC identified but seven countries as "most active." By 2001 the number had risen to 75 and, by 2002, nearly 100 were identified. </SPAN></P>
