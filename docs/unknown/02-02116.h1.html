<P>Applicant's financial irresponsibility was not mitigated where his debts were caused largely by circumstances within his control and his own irresponsibility. He 
took no effective action to address his indebtedness, despite having the means to do so, until issuance of the SOR. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 2 January 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-02116.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 13 
February 2003, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. I received this case on 14 March 2003, and set it for hearing the same day. On 18 March 
2003, I issued a notice of hearing for 2 April 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the Government presented five exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant also presented five exhibits--admitted 
without objection--and the testimony of two witnesses, including himself. DOHA received the transcript on 10 April 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of subparagraphs 1. a. (1995 bankruptcy) and c. (unpaid IRS lien).  I incorporate these admissions as findings of fact. He 
denied the allegations of 1.b., d., e., and f. because he had paid these debts in January and February 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 46-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access to classified information he has held since approximately 1983. He is an 
electrical engineer.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 3 May 2001, Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA)(SF 86)(G.E. 1) on which he truthfully disclosed a variety of adverse financial 
circumstances, including a 1995 bankruptcy filing. In September 2001, he gave a sworn statement to the DSS (G.E. 2) in which he indicated that he disagreed 
with the entries on his credit bureau report (CBR), but would obtain a copy and resolve the discrepancies.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has five delinquent debts totaling approximately $30,000.00. An IRS lien represents more than $25,000.00 of that total. Except for the IRS lien, for 
which Applicant entered into a repayment agreement in March 2003, all the debts have been paid, albeit in January and February 2003, after Applicant received 
the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to the failure of his computer network business in 1995 and a sharp decline in the real estate market beginning in 
1991 that virtually eliminated the equity in his home. However, the record reveals that Applicant's financial difficulties are more directly related to his financial 
irresponsibility and a lackadaisical attitude toward his finances. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1994, Applicant left his job by mutual agreement after allegations of unsatisfactory performance. He was a "high stress supervisor" who yelled at his 
subordinates even after being warned by his management.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Attracted by the booming high tech economy where he lived, Applicant decided to start a computer networking business, despite the fact that he had no prior 
experience running a business, and had no business plan. He did not incorporate, but set up a sole proprietorship. He used $100,000.00 from his 401K account 
as seed money, even though he knew the money would now be considered taxable income, and be subject to early-withdrawal penalties.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Some initial success in the business was followed by stiff competition as giant computer manufacturers moved into the networking business themselves. 
Applicant maxed out his credit cards and spent the $100,000.00. His financial circumstances were complicated further by the sharp decline in real estate values 
where he lived, essentially wiping out his equity between 1991 and 1994.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  In March 1995, on the advice of counsel, Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection. In September 1995, Applicant was discharged from more than $25,000.00 
in unsecured debt. At the time of his petition, he had a debt to IRS for $2,900.00 for 1989, and a prospective debt to IRS for $11,000.00 for 1994. His debts 
were all business related. He apparently did not include utility bills for his residence in the filing, and moved without resolving his final balances. He closed his 
business in February 1996, and went to work for another defense contractor in March 1996. He has been continuously employed since.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1995 and 2003, Applicant lived in four different states and six different addresses. He was not good about advising his creditors about address 
changes. He focused almost exclusively on his work, not paying much attention to his finances. He apparently took no action to resolve his IRS issues or to deal 
with state tax authorities. In January 1997, the state where Applicant resided at the time of his bankruptcy filed a lien for unpaid taxes of nearly $2,000.00. 
Applicant did not resolve this debt until January and February 2003, when he made two payments on an agreed settlement amount. In July 2001, the IRS filed a 
lien for over $25,000.00 in back taxes. The IRS seized Applicant's income tax refunds for 2000 and 2001, but Applicant did not otherwise make arrangements 
to repay this debt until March 2003, when he agreed to begin paying $600.00 per month. However, Applicant's Exhibit B (A.E. B), which memorializes 
Applicant's commitment to begin the payments, reflects that Applicant's debt to the IRS, including tax years 1989, 1994, 1997, and 1998, has grown to over 
$36,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had medical treatment for which he had insurance. However, because of administrative errors, the insurance company refused to pay. In turn, 
Applicant refused to pay the medical facilities despite the fact that he knew he was directly liable to the providers for his treatment, notwithstanding any third 
party obligations. The two accounts (1.d. and e.) were sent to collection and not paid by Applicant until after he received the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a positive monthly cash flow of approximately $740.00. He has over $26,000.00 in his company 401K account. The balance was higher before he 
withdrew $18,000.00 to zero out his credit card balances in the wake of the SOR and to pay his attorney. His current CBR is essentially clean. He has no trouble 
living within his means. Applicant's coworker testified that Applicant does not live an extravagant lifestyle. Applicant testified that he never really paid 
attention to his finances because he was so focused on his work. He did not realize the security significance of his credit, but now does.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3.3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment. . . divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline F. The record evidence clearly establishes Applicant's history of indebtedness and his blas&eacute; attitude 
toward it until confronted with the prospect of losing his clearance. With the exception of the period when Applicant was self-employed, and his business 
failure led to his filing bankruptcy, Applicant has never lacked the means to pay his debts. However, he has lacked the willingness to do so.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial difficulties are both recent and not isolated. While four of the five 
debts alleged have been paid, they were only paid in the wake of the SOR, notwithstanding that Applicant knew of the government's financial concerns as early 
as September 2001. Similarly, although Applicant knew as of his bankruptcy filing in 1995 that he had remaining tax liability to the IRS, and had a lien filed 
against him in 2001, he took no action to address this debt until receiving the SOR. I am unable to conclude that Applicant is unlikely to fall back into a pattern 
of neglecting his finances. Consequently, I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
