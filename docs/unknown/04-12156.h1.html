<P>Applicant is 58 years old and holds a doctorate in nuclear engineering. He works in many facets of scientific research and has worked for a defense contractor 
since 1994. He has held a secret clearance since 1991. Applicant was a citizen of Israel and became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. in 1990. To enter and exit 
Israel he was required to obtain an Israeli passport. Applicant has surrendered the passport, and is willing to renounce his former citizenship. Applicant's wife is 
a dual citizen of the U.S. and Argentina, and has extended family in Argentina and Israel. Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns under

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On July 28, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant Statements of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaints, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C (foreign preference) and Guideline B (foreign influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">September 2, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. In his SOR responses, Applicant admitted 
and denied certain allegations under Guidelines C and B. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on November 2, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued on November 9, 
2005, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">December 8, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An amended notice of hearing was issued on November 23, 2005, rescheduling the hearing for December 
7, 2005, with the concurrence of Applicant. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted eight exhibits that were marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted five exhibits 
that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits A-E. The exhibits were admitted without objection. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 22, 
2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 58 years old. He was born in Bulgaria and in 1959, at the age of 12, he and his family fled and immigrated to France as refugees. At the age of 17, 
his parents made the decision that he should become a French citizen. He remained in France until 1971, and at the age of 23 went to Israel. He had already 
received a bachelor's degree in mathematics and a master's degree in physics in France. He left to pursue additional education and received a second master's 
degree in chemical engineer in 1975, and a doctorate in nuclear engineering in 1978. Applicant's education was funded by a U.S. corporation to whom he 
provided the results of his research. Applicant is of Jewish ethnicity and became a citizen of Israel while living there, and received benefits from his citizenship, 
such as a scholarship. He was required to perform military service and was conscripted as a soldier. He stood border guard duty for a short period, but was 
assigned to an academic group whose members were permitted to continue their studies during their conscription. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married an Argentinian/Israeli dual citizen in 1975. Together they immigrated to the United States in 1978. Applicant was 31 years old and has 
considered himself an American since arriving. Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1990. His wife is also a naturalized citizen of the 
United States, but maintains dual citizenship with Argentina. She only travels on her U.S. passport. Applicant and his wife have two daughters, both born in the 
United States, who hold U.S. passports only.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is currently the director at a center for engineering science, works for a federal contractor, is a professor of computer science at a state university, and 
is a resident affiliate for a jet propulsion laboratory. Applicant has held a secret security clearance since 1991.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After becoming a U.S. citizen Applicant traveled to Israel with only his U.S. passport. Upon arriving, Israeli immigration refused to accept his U.S. passport 
because he had previously been a citizen of Israel. He was required to pay a fine to enter the country and was required to obtain an Israeli passport in order to 
exit the country.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant complied. Applicant used his Israeli passport to enter and exit Israel in, July-August 1997, June 2001, and January 2003. Applicant 
used his U.S. passport for all other international travel.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant became aware through the SOR that possession of a foreign passport was now a disqualifying condition he sought guidance for surrendering 
the passport. Applicant surrendered his Israeli passport to the Consulate General of Israel on October 28, 2005.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant was willing to renounce his French 
and Israeli citizenship in 1991<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and reaffirmed his willingness at his hearing.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant readily volunteers that he would bear arms for the United States against 
any foreign country to include both Israel and France, and he would not fight for any foreign country. His total allegiance is to the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's elderly father lives in France and is a retired attorney. His mother is deceased. His father worked in private practice and has no contact with the 
government.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> He talks to his father about once a month and when he travels to France on business, he will stop in and see him. Applicant's brother also lives in 
France. He owns his own computer repair company and does not have any contact with the government.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant has contact with his brother a couple of 
times a year. Applicant's wife's parents are deceased and she has one brother who lives in the U.S.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant's wife has aunts and cousins in Israel and 
Applicant and his wife will visit them on average about once a year. None of them work for the government; they are lawyers, teachers and work in agriculture.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> 
She also has extended family in Argentina, but apparently little or no contact with them. Applicant has only one cousin in Israel, with whom he has no contact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Israel is a parliamentary democracy with a modern economy.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Israel has close ties with the United States. Israel has strict security requirements and Americans 
have been detained, searched and denied access to U.S. consular offices, lawyers of family members.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The national police have monitored, arrested and 
deported members of religious groups who they believe intend violence toward Israel.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The U.S. government has tight restrictions for American traveling in 
Israel due to the civil unrest there.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> "U.S. citizens, including tourists, students, residents, and U.S. mission personnel, have been injured or killed in terrorist 
actions in Israel."<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The potential for further violence is high.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> Israeli citizens naturalized in the United States retain their Israeli citizenship.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Israeli citizens, 
including dual nationals, must enter and depart Israel on their Israeli passports.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline C, foreign preference, and Guideline B, foreign influence, with their respective DC and MC, apply in this case. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C-Foreign Preference is a security concern because when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the 
United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B-Foreign Influence is a concern because a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons 
to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligations are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interest in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guidelines C and B.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1 (<EM>The exercise of dual citizenship); </EM>FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2 (<EM>Possession 
and/or use of a foreign passport);</EM>FP DC E2.A3.1.2.3 (<EM>Military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country)</EM>, FP DC E2.A3.1.2.4 (<EM>Accepting 
educational, medical, or other benefits, such as retirement and social welfare, from a foreign country) </EM>and FP DC E2.A3.1.2.5 (<EM>Residence in a foreign country 
to meet citizenship requirements)</EM> apply. Applicant obtained and used an Israeli passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. The possession and/or use of a foreign 
passport is an exercise of dual citizenship. Applicant served in the Israeli military and received educational benefits such as an academic scholarship while he 
was a citizen of Israel. He was required to be a citizen to receive these benefits. A foreign preference can be shown by an applicant's exercise of the rights and 
privileges of foreign citizenship for reason of personal convenience or expediency.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Use of a foreign passport for personal convenience is not extenuating or 
mitigating.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> All of the above disqualifying conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition<EM> </EM>(FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.2<EM> (Indicators of possible 
foreign preference (e.g. foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship) </EM>and FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4 (<EM>Individual has expressed a 
willingness to renounce dual citizenship),</EM>and conclude both apply. Applicant was conscripted into the Israeli military before becoming a U.S. citizen. He also 
received educational benefits and met the resident requirements due to his citizenship that occurred before he became a U.S. citizen. In accordance with a 
memorandum issued by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communication, and Intelligence, Arthur L. Money, dated August 16, 2000, 
(Money Memorandum), a security clearance must be denied or revoked for an Applicant with a foreign passport "unless the applicant surrenders the foreign 
passport." Surrender of the passport contemplates returning it to the issuing authority. Applicant willingly returned the Israeli passport to the appropriate 
authority. Applicant has exercised dual citizenship in the past and is willing to renounce it. I find the above mitigating conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1 (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country), </EM>and FI DC E2.A2.1.2.2 (<EM>Sharing living quarters with a 
person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists)</EM> apply. Applicant's wife is a dual citizen 
of the U.S. and Argentina and presumably Israel. She is an immediate family member who lives with the Applicant in the U.S. An immediate family includes 
spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> Applicant's wife's parents are deceased and her only sibling lives in the U.S. She has extended 
family in Israel and Argentina. Both Applicant and his wife visit her extended family in Israel about once a year. I find Applicant and his wife have ties of 
affection to her extended family and the above disqualifying condition applies. Applicant's father and brother live in France, however these facts were not 
raised as an allegation and therefore will not be considered for disqualifying purposes. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1 (<EM>A determination that the 
immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign 
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the 
United States),</EM> and FI MC E2.A2.1.3.3 (<EM>Contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent). </EM>Applicant and his wife have some 
contact with her extended family as evidenced by their visits to Israel. The frequency of the visits and the extended familial relationship through his wife is a 
matter of mitigation. Because there is some contact I have considered their ties of affection to be minimal. I conclude Applicant's cousin is not a member of 
Applicant's immediate family, nor is he bound to his cousin by close ties of affection or obligation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife's aunts and cousins are not agents of a foreign power since they are not engaged in intelligence work and work in the private sector.<A HREF="04-12156.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> The 
question remains whether the relatives are in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to the 
wife's relatives vice the United States. Another consideration is whether these relatives are vulnerable to exploitation in such a way as to have Applicant act 
adversely to the interests of the United States. A factor to consider, while not determinative, is an analysis of the character of the foreign power and entities 
within the foreign country. This review is not limited to countries that are hostile to the United States. Friendly countries may have profound disagreements 
with the United States or have engaged in espionage against the United States especially in economic, scientific, military, and technical fields. A friendly 
relationship is not determinative, but it may make it less likely that a foreign government would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates 
in that country. Although there are terrorist activities and components in Israel it is a country with longstanding close ties with the United States, and is equally 
committed to combating terrorism. I find Applicant's in-laws are extended family and although he has some contact it is minimal. I find the potential 
vulnerability is not a security risk.. FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1 applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the whole person and kept in mind that any doubt as to whether access to classified information must be resolved in favor of national security. 
Applicant has strong ties to his adopted country, including his children, and his professional ties are all in the United States. Past conduct is a strong predictor of 
future conduct. Applicant has held a security clearance since 1991, with no security issues. Applicant has worked and had access to classified information for 
over 14 years. This extended period of time is an important predictor when analyzing Applicant's security vulnerability. Balancing the potentially disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions and considering the totality of all the evidence, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guidelines C and B, 
and it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
