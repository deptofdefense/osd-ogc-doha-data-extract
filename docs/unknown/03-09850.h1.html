<P>Applicant was convicted of three counts of child molesting in 2001/2002, involving two young females.  He admits exposing himself and masturbating in front 
of the girls, one of whom was his girlfriend's daughter.  His only excuse was that he was in a period of family stress.  He remains on probation until 2005, is 
receiving counseling, and is required to stay away from the victims.  No mitigation has been established.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On March 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On March 25, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing by a DOHA Administrative 
Judge.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on May 10, 2004.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 25, 2004 setting the hearing for July 12, 2004.  
At the hearing, the Government did not call any witnesses but submitted six documents, which were marked for identification as Government's Exhibits (GX) 1 
- 6.  Applicant testified, called three other witnesses, and offered seven exhibits, which were marked as Applicant's Exhibit (AX) A - G.  The transcript was 
received at DOHA on August 5, 2004. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old technician for a defense contractor who is seeking a security clearance for Applicant in connection with his employment.  The SOR 
contains one allegation under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and one related allegation under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  </P> 
 
<P>In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits the single Guideline J allegation "as to the no contest pleading" but denies the allegation as to his "reliability and 
trustworthiness."  He denies the Guideline E allegation "as to lack of candor, dishonesty, and failure to comply with rules and regulations," but admits "to a 
severe lack of judgment in all instances, but den[ies] that it will ever happen again."  Both admissions are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.   </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering the totality of the evidence in the case file, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF FACT as to the status, past and present, of each 
SOR allegation:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1.</STRONG> <STRONG>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  In February 2002, this 49-year-old Applicant was arrested on three counts of Child Molesting.  In August 2002, he pleaded no contest to three counts of 
Child Molesting (Tr at 47).<A HREF="03-09850.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  He was placed on three years of probation, ordered to attend counseling, register as a sex offender, and serve 90 days in jail.  
Applicant satisfied all requirements of the court disposition with the exception of the three years of  probation, which is expected to be completed in 2005. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>2. Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. - The information in subparagraph 1.a., above.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant has received a favorable letter from a License Clinical Social Worker (AX 5), and favorable testimony, letters, and evaluations from friends, co-workers, and his company (Tr at 23 - 47, AX A, B, C, D, E, and F).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and 
maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence 
(Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors cited above exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment 
and conduct.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  In reaching the fair and 
impartial overall common sense determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to 
speculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, 
the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and 
material twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an applicant for a security 
clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  
These concerns include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or 
information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the 
Statement of Reasons.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security concerns under the 
Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the 
nation's security."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>1. Guideline J </STRONG>(Criminal Conduct) and <STRONG>2. Guideline E </STRONG>(Personal Conduct)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The criminal conduct in question is child molesting that occurred in about early 2002.  Applicant lived for nine years with a woman who had a young daughter, 
who was about 8 and 12 when the incidents occurred.  According to a sheriff's report, the girl told her mother and the sheriff that the suspect entered her 
bedroom and "exposed himself in a lewd manner" (GX 4).  On the first occasion, when she was about eight,<A HREF="03-09850.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant walked into her bedroom completely 
naked.  His penis was erect and he was touching himself.  When she was 11, he began entering her bedroom again, naked and touching himself again.  She 
warned him to stop doing so or she would tell her mother.  Applicant did not desist but repeated the conduct at least 15 more times, usually when her mother 
was out of the house or sleeping in another room.  On some occasions, Applicant was wearing a robe that was hanging open.  Around her 12<SUP>th</SUP> birthday, he 
entered her room, masturbated in front of her, and ejaculated onto her bed comforter.  She scooped up some of the ejaculate in a plastic egg and showed it to her 
mother.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When questioned by the sheriff, Applicant did not deny the allegation but did not admit it either.  Eventually, when asked again about exposing himself and 
then masturbating in front of the victim, he nodded his head up and down, signifying "Yes" to the sheriff deputy (GX 4 at pages 8, 9).  Applicant's final words 
on the matter came at the hearing.  As his counsel stated: Applicant "admitted to the offenses.  He cooperated with the investigation.  He underwent a rigorous 
therapeutic and counseling regimen" and "the matter is now under control" (Tr at 20).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All three of Applicant's witnesses speak highly of him.  However, I note that one witness testified that Applicant told him the conduct was "accidental" rather 
than "intentional" and that "it" occurred while he was walking from a bathroom to his room, which suggests a one-time occurrence  and a lack on intent, all of 
which is contrary to the rest of the evidence of record (Tr at 34, 35).  Applicant explained his lack of complete candor with his three witnesses as the result of  
embarrassment (Tr at 48, at line 8, 57, 58).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledges that he is a registered sex offender, that he is still on probation, and that he is receiving counseling (Tr at 48).  He did expose himself 
to eight-year-old girls and he did masturbate in front of them (Tr at 49, 54 - 56).  He lied to the victim's mother when he told her the ejaculate described by the 
victim was actually soap (Tr at 57).  Applicant's views himself as currently eligible for a security clearance because "it was a remote incident" that he regrets. 
(Tr at 50).  To prevent any recurrence, he is determined not to be socially involved with any woman who has children and he "just simply avoid[s] minors at all 
costs" (<EM>Id</EM>.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is single and lives with his mother (Tr at 51).  He is on probation until 2005 and he understands that a violation would likely land him jail (Tr at 59).  
The praise of his supporters and his counseling are certainly positive factors to be considered, but considering the nature of the misconduct, it is at least as 
possible that the absence of recent recurrence is due to the pressures imposed by the sentence and probation rather than a result of lasting psychological 
rehabilitation.  It is just too soon to be able to conclude that Applicant has, and will continue to have, the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of 
someone seeking access to the nation's secrets.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J - Disqualifying Conditions 1 (any criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged) and 2 (a single serious crime or 
multiple lesser offenses) are clearly applicable.  I find that none of the possible Mitigating Conditions has been demonstrated by Applicant; e.g., the criminal 
behavior in 2002 is deemed, in context, to be still recent, (MC 1); not an isolated incident (MC 2); and no clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC 5).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E (Personal Conduct) Viewing the same evidence discussed above in the context of Guideline E, Disqualifying Conditions 1 (reliable, unfavorable 
information) is applicable but, as yet, none of the possible Mitigating Conditions have been established.      </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered the testimony of Applicant's statements and all other evidence.  While I accept the statements of his witnesses as to their opinions of 
Applicant, at lest one witness agreed that his opinion might have been different if he knew the full facts and circumstances behind the misconduct.  Few 
criminal violations offend the basic fabric of our society's standards for taking care of our children as child molesting.  The misdemeanor child molesting 
accusations, to which he pleaded no contest, rightfully raise question about Applicant's ability to comply with the rules that bind all of us.  The sexual feelings 
and drives that led to his period of misconduct appear to be of a nature that is difficult to overcome without successful, long, and containing care, as diagnosed 
by mental health professionals.  While Applicant's family, friends, and co-workers are free to accept him as he is, DoD does not have that luxury.  Holding a 
security clearance is a privilege and anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets must conform to DoD requirements.  In this context, the record compels the 
conclusion that too much serious criminal and personal misconduct has occurred over too long a period of time, and too recently, to allow a finding of current 
eligibility.  Viewing the totality of the evidence, I cannot conclude Applicant has demonstrated the integrity, good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness 
required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets. </SPAN></P>
