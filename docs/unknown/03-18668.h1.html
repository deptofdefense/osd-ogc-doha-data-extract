<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts, most of which he accumulated following his military retirement in 1993.  The still unpaid debts total over 
$17,000.00 and still remain significant after satisfaction of his back federal taxes. While Applicant is to be encouraged in acknowledging responsibility for the 
debts (many of which were incurred by his wife),  his repayment efforts remain too much a work in progress to make any safe predictable judgments at this time 
about his debt resolution prospects.  Applicant fails to mitigate security concerns associated with his delinquent debts.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 15, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on July 12, 2004, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on  August 30, 2004.  Applicant  responded to the FORM within the 30 days provided him with supplemental documentation 
regarding his finances.   The case was assigned to me October 8,  2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated delinquent debts with nine different creditors in excess of $19,000.00.   For his answer to the 
SOR, Applicant admitted to several of the listed debts, but denied most of them, claiming disputes with one and non-responsibility for others, with explanations 
and attachments detailing prior payments with two of the listed creditors.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old communications field engineer for a defense contractors who seeks to retain his security clearance.  The allegations covered in the 
SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant enlisted in the Navy following his graduation from high school in 1973. His 20-year Navy enlistment included three forward deployed combat 
missions that earned Applicant numerous awards for his superior performance.  During his last six months of his Navy enlistment, he provided pre-deployment 
support for which he received letters of appreciation from various ship captains.  Before his retirement from the Navy in 1993, Applicant encountered no 
identifiable financial problems.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his military retirement in 1993, Applicant relocated to a western city where he could not find gainful employment for over six months and 
accumulated numerous delinquent consumer debts.  Most of these debts he attributes to his wife's gambling problems and do not appear to be specifically 
related to income losses from his unemployment situation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several of Applicant's admitted debt delinquencies have gone unattended while Applicant seeks to accumulate more savings.  While promising to contact these 
creditors in a signed, sworn statement he gave to an interviewing Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in May 2003, he documents past  monthly payments 
with only three of them: creditors 1.a, 1.h and 1.i.  Two of these documented payment streams are  quite dated and relatively small in comparison to the overall 
debts owed.  Only Applicant's listed IRS debt covering tax years 2000 and 2001 (<EM>see </EM>ex. 8) in the aggregate of $1,860.84 reflect substantial payments that 
appear to satisfy his IRS obligation based on the supplied ledger of account activity.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each of Applicant's listed debts in the SOR is covered in Applicant's credit reports (exs. 6 and 7).  Addressing these individual debts, Applicant claims a 
longstanding dispute with creditor 1.a, which resulted in creditor 1.a's filing a civil complaint against Applicant in June 1995 and culminated in creditor 1.a's 
obtaining a judgment against Applicant in May 1999 in the approximate amount of $8,016.00.   After entering into a consolidation loan agreement with this 
creditor in March 1993 (before his military discharge) for the purpose of paying off two other creditors, Applicant made regular payments on this loan over the 
balance of 1993 before experiencing some hardship following his discharge.  Thereafter, his payments to creditor 1.a slowed somewhat as he grappled with 
unemployment and his wife's gambling problems.  After June 1995 creditor 1.a ceased communications with Applicant, which prompted Applicant to quit 
making payments altogether.  Believing that creditor 1.a's judgment was taken in bad faith by the creditor and its attorneys, Applicant refuses to pay anything 
more on this creditor's account balance.  To what extent creditor 1.a has initiated any collection efforts (if any) on its judgment, much less improper ones, is  
unclear from this administrative record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Claiming settlement arrangements with creditors 1.b and 1.c, Applicant provides no documentation of any payments or payment arrangements with either of 
these creditors.  Without  documentation, his claims cannot be corroborated or accepted just on faith.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the balance of Applicant's listed debts, Applicant claims only a general willingness to make payments on them in the future.  He provides no 
documentation that he has addressed these delinquent debts in the past, despite a stated monthly net remainder of $1,652.00 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1.  The behavior was not recent.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debt following his retirement from military service in 1993 and ensuing difficulties finding employment.  His still 
unpaid delinquent debts exceed $17,000.00 (after crediting him with payment of his back taxes to the IRS) and lack any initiated payment arrangements with 
his creditors. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite his stated intentions to address his delinquent debts, Applicant remains obligated to all but one of the creditors listed in the SOR (<EM>i.e., </EM>his IRS debt, 
which he is credited with satisfying). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On this record, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations 
apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's accrued debts are accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>lack of steady good paying work following his military retirement 
in 1993), for the most part his finances have permitted modest attempts to pay on his old creditors with the resources available to Applicant after he gained 
steady employment with his current employer in 1994 (a period of almost 10 years).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are neither extenuated nor mitigated enough to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His six months 
of underemployment in 1993, while problematic, does not appear to have been so prolonged or contributive to his debt delinquencies as to preclude his 
addressing his delinquent debts when he gained work with his current defense contractor.  To be sure, Applicant doesn't assign principal blame for his debt 
delinquencies to his unemployment.  To the contrary, he attributes most of his debt delinquencies to his wife's gambling problem and the misbehavior of 
creditor 1.a's attorneys in shutting off payment discussions and proceeding to litigation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, Applicant has not demonstrated sufficient extenuating circumstances in this administrative record to enable him to invoke MC 3 (conditions largely 
beyond the person's control) of the Guideline.  While he has paid one of the nine delinquent debts and made some past payments on two others, his overall 
repayment efforts remain a work in progress and insufficient at this time to invoke any of the mitigating conditions of the Guidelines, primarily MC 6 (initiated 
a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) based on his repayment efforts.   The Appeal Board has counseled against according much weight to belated 
efforts and promises to address delinquent debts well after the security clearance process has been initiated.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-33581 (July 20, 2004).  
Also, where there is insufficient evidence of repayment efforts after the conditions that contributed to an applicant's delinquent debts have passed, the Appeal 
Board has cautioned against crediting the applicant with either non-recent financial difficulties (MC 1 of the Guidelines) or excuse from addressing his 
delinquent debts (even those accrued because of extenuating circumstances).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (September 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To Applicant's credit, he has since taken steps to pay off his back federal taxes and accept responsibility for some of his debts.  At the same time, he provides 
no viable repayment plan with his current resources.  And his efforts to date are not of sufficient strength to enable him to mitigate security concerns associated 
with his longstanding delinquent debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his debts in the past, and 
his continued resistence to exploring payment arrangements with creditor 1.a who holds a judgment against him on an unpaid loan consolidation debt he 
incurred while he was still in the Navy, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h of the allegations governed by the 
Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 1.I of the allegations covered by the Guideline.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E: 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the 
factors listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:</SPAN></P>
