</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 47-year-old married man and dual citizen of the U.S. and the United Kingdom of Great Britain (U.K.). His remaining financial asset in the U.K. 
is less than 9% of his net worth and is minimal compared with his substantial U.S. financial interests. Despite his exercise of dual citizenship by possession and 
one-time use of a British passport after obtaining U.S. citizenship, the totality of his actions--including surrendering his British passport--shows a genuine 
preference for the U.S. over the U.K. Applicant has successfully mitigated the foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns. Clearance granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 20, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> On June 11, 2002, Applicant answered the SOR, and 
he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</P> 
<P>On August 8,  2002, DOHA assigned this case to me to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. Thereafter, a notice of hearing was issued to the parties 
scheduling the hearing for September 10, 2002, at a location near Applicant's place of employment. </P> 
<P>At my request, a pre-hearing conference via telephone-conference call was held on August 26, 2002. The agenda for and the results of the pre-hearing 
conference are detailed in my letters to the parties, dated August 15 and 26, 2002, respectively. </P> 
<P>In addition, Applicant's counsel submitted a 12-page "Memorandum of Points and Authorities" on September 4, 2002. The memorandum is also included in 
Applicant's exhibit book. Department Counsel elected to not file a written response to the memorandum.  </P> 
<P>At the hearing, Department Counsel offered two documentary exhibits admitted without objections; no witnesses were called. Applicant appeared with counsel, 
offered his own testimony and that of three witnesses, and offered one documentary exhibit admitted without objections. Applicant's Exhibit A (the exhibit 
book) consists of two three-ring binders with 62 individual tabs. Consistent with the limitations discussed during the hearing, not all the materials  in Exhibit A 
are admitted as some of the materials are legal (e.g., directives, regulations, case law, etc.) and not factual materials. In particular, the following materials are<EM> 
not</EM> admitted into the record as evidence: Tabs 1-8, Tab 20, Tab 31, and Tabs 33-36. I will consider these matters, however, as part of Applicant's arguments. 
The materials at the remaining tabs are admitted into the record as evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on September 19, 2002.</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B for foreign influence and Guideline C for foreign preference. The foreign influence allegation is based on 
Applicant's financial interests in the U.K. consisting of checking and savings accounts, a life insurance policy, and a retirement fund. The foreign preference 
allegation is based on exercising dual citizenship and possessing a British passport. In his seven-page answer, Applicant provided detailed explanations 
intended to mitigate the alleged security concerns. In addition, he enclosed numerous documents to his Answer and those documents are also part of the record 
evidence to the extent they do not duplicate materials in Exhibits A.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After Applicant had completed his direct examination, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In particular, the proposed amendment was a new 
allegation or subparagraph to SOR paragraph 2 concerning foreign influence as follows: "Your mother, brother, and sister are citizens of, and residents in, the 
U.K." Applicants' counsel opposed the amendment on various grounds including had they knew about the proposed amendment beforehand, they would have 
obtained affidavits from these persons and considered having Applicant's 81-year-old mother travel from the U.K. to testify. Department Counsel 
acknowledged the agency had previously made an affirmative decision not to allege these matters based on a determination Applicant's  immediate family 
members were not a security concern at that time.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> After giving the parties a full opportunity to state their positions, I denied the motion for the reasons stated 
during the hearing.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After the parties had rested their cases, SOR subparagraph 1.b. was amended, without objections from the parties, by deleting the word and figures "March 10, 
1999" and substituting therefor the word and figures "March 10, 1998" to conform to the evidence.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a thorough review of the pleadings, the 239-page transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">1. Applicant testified during the hearing, and I accept his testimony as credible and true. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">2. Applicant is a 47-year-old married man seeking a security clearance at the secret level. He has lived in the U.S. since July 1988. He married a native-born 
U.S. citizen in December 1991, and the couple have two daughters who are also native-born U.S. citizens born in 1994 and 1996. The family's long-term plan 
is to remain at their current U.S. location. Applicant has no intent to relocate to the U.K. as he considers the U.S. his permanent home.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">3. Although not yet a U.S. citizen, Applicant was granted a secret security clearance in about July 1994 under a Limited Access Authorization (LAA) based on 
compelling reasons. He is employed as a project engineer/senior systems engineer for a major defense contractor with core business areas of systems 
integration, aeronautics, space, and technology services. He has worked for this company, primarily on aviation-related projects, since January 1993. Applicant 
has never been suspected, accused, or cited for a security violation related to his handling and safeguarding of U.S. classified information. This fact was 
confirmed by the company's manager of industrial security/facility security officer.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">4. Born in 1955, Applicant is a British citizen by birth. His father, now deceased, and mother are both British citizens. In addition, Applicant has a bother and 
sister who are British citizens who live in the U.K. After graduating from college with an engineering degree in 1978, he accepted employment with a British 
defense contractor. He worked for that company until accepting employment with his current employer in January 1993. Applicant held a security clearance, 
with NATO access, issued by the British government from 1978 until resigning in December 1992.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">5. In July 1988, while still employed by the British company, the then 33-year-old Applicant accepted a temporary assignment in the U.S. expected to last 18 
months. He was allowed to enter the U.S. by an employment-based visa. His temporary assignment was extended and sometime during this first three years in 
the U.S., Applicant decided he wanted to remain here. He filed a petition for resident alien status based on employment. When Applicant married his American 
spouse in December 1991, he re-filed his immigration petition to obtain resident alien status based on marriage to a U.S. citizen. He did so in April 1992 and 
the petition was approved. Thereafter, he submitted an application for U.S. citizenship via naturalization in August 1996, it was approved, and Applicant took 
his oath of citizenship, as required by law, on or about March 25, 1999. He obtained a U.S. passport in June 1999. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">6. Obtaining U.S. citizenship was a celebrated event for Applicant, his wife and children, and their friends and neighbors. Applicant hosted a neighborhood 
party in honor of the event. The highlight of the party occurred when Applicant was presented with two U.S. flags that were flown over the USS Theodore 
Roosevelt and the USS George Washington in his honor on March 23, 1999, the day he took his oath of citizenship.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">7. In April 2001, Applicant completed a security-clearance application.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> In doing so, he revealed his dual citizenship, had attended and graduated from college 
in the U.K., was formerly employed by a British company, had family members who were citizens of, and residents in, the U.K., owned four different financial 
interests (a pension fund, two bank accounts, and a life insurance endowment policy) in the U.K., possessed a British passport, and had traveled four times to 
the U.K. during the last seven years. Otherwise, his security-clearance application was unremarkable from a security perspective.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">8. In May 2001, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS).<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant addressed his British 
connections and interests in detail. Concerning his willingness to renounce his British citizenship, Applicant said he would consider doing so if necessary to 
maintain a security clearance. He also indicated that he would use his British passport in the future if he was traveling alone and the lines at immigration were 
shorter.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">9. Obviously, Applicant entered the U.S. in 1988 with a British passport. He continued to possess and use that passport when necessary while residing in the 
U.S. As the passport was set to expire, Applicant renewed it in March 1998, one year before obtaining U.S. citizenship in March 1999. Since then, Applicant 
has used his U.S. passport for foreign travel with one exception. In May 2000,  Applicant and his family were traveling to the U.K. to visit family and Applicant 
used his British passport to clear immigration at the airport in the U.K. Applicant explained he used his British passport because the line was shorter and gave it 
no other thought. He used his U.S. passport at all other times during that trip. Since being advised of the security concern surrounding the possession and/or use 
of a foreign passport (the so-called Money Memorandum),<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Applicant surrendered his British passport, which was received by the British Embassy in 
Washington, D.C., on June 25, 2002.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> In addition, Applicant has no intention of reapplying for a British passport.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">10. After approximately ten years of work in the U.K., Applicant had acquired financial interests that he continued to hold when he arrived in the U.S. in 1988. 
Those financial interests included the four accounts alleged in the SOR as well as a house. After his marriage in 1991, Applicant sold his home in the U.K., 
transferred the sale proceeds to his bank in the U.S., and used the money for a house down payment. After receiving the SOR and seeking advice of legal 
counsel, Applicant took action and liquidated three of the four accounts--the checking and savings account and the life insurance endowment policy--in the 
U.K. Liquidating the life insurance endowment policy resulted in an economic loss to the Applicant of approximately $10,000. The proceeds from the bank 
accounts and life insurance policy were transferred to Applicant's bank in the U.S. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">11. The remaining account is a retirement fund; it stems from Applicant's previous employment with the British company that provided a pension plan as an 
employee benefit. The pension plan was funded by the company and the U.K. government.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> After leaving his job with the British firm, he transferred the 
pension plan to an individual account so he would have more control over investment decisions. The current retirement account is akin to a U.S. IRA fund and 
is held by a multinational financial firm. Despite his efforts, Applicant has been unable to transfer or otherwise liquidate the retirement fund because a U.S. IRA 
fund may not accept the money from the British retirement fund. Although he was still trying when the hearing convened, it appears unlikely Applicant will be 
able to transfer or otherwise liquidate this account due to these restrictions. Indeed, Applicant, as he understands the rules, cannot touch the money until he 
reaches retirement age. The value of this retirement fund, which has not been funded since December 1992, is approximately $50,000.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Otherwise, Applicant 
has no other financial interests in the U.K. or any other foreign country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">12. Applicant's financial interests in the U.S. are substantial. He and his wife built a home in 1993 at a cost of more than $200,000; the current market value is 
about $275,000. As of August 27, 2002, the couple's net worth was estimated at $570,000.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> This estimate does not include Applicant's expected U.S. social 
security benefit of $1,200 monthly at age 62<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> or his estimated pension of $3,700 monthly for 10 years from his current employer.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> In addition, the couple's 
assets include approximately $6,900 invested in their state's prepaid college fund and $11,000 for their daughters' anticipated college expenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">13. Applicant's mother, age 81, is retired and financially self-sufficient. Applicant has one brother and one sister who are British citizens residing in the U.K. 
The brother is employed as a civil engineer for a construction company. His sister works as a grade school teacher. His mother and siblings are not connected to 
British law enforcement, military, or a national governmental agency. Likewise, they are not involved in political, scientific, commercial, or other activities 
where they might benefit from obtaining U.S. national security information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">14. In his June 2002 Answer, Applicant said he was prepared to renounce his British citizenship if required to hold a security clearance. In addition, he 
indicated he will renounce his British citizenship if that government requires him to make any statement or take any action inconsistent with his U.S. citizenship 
oath, an oath he takes seriously. Applicant's hearing testimony is consistent with his earlier statements in that he expressed a conditional willingness to 
renounce his British citizenship.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Some of his reluctance is based on his belief that doing so will upset his mother.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Despite this reluctance, Applicant has no 
intention to exercise his British citizenship or otherwise use it to receive some benefit or protect some interest.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">15. Applicant has never served in the British military and would refuse to do so if asked. He is willing to bear arms for the U.S. if required to do so. Applicant 
is a registered voter and has voted in U.S. elections. He has not paid British income taxes since approximately 1988. Since moving here, he has since paid state 
and federal income taxes and complied with applicable tax reporting requirements. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">16. Applicant and his spouse are active and involved in various community and church activities. In particular, Applicant participates in a local PTA 
organization and he is a member of girl scouts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">17. Applicant has submitted a wealth of material demonstrating his overall good character as a person, his outstanding performance at work, and his security 
suitability.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> In particular, Applicant receives high praise from the former F-14 Program Manager for the Navy.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> This retired Navy captain ties many of the 
successes of the program to Applicant's direct involvement, and he believes Applicant is an honest and trustworthy person. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">18. The U.K. is a democratic country governed by the rule of law and a longtime, close ally of the U.S. and a member of the NATO. The government is a 
Constitutional monarchy with executive, legislative, and judicial branches. The political parties are multiple and diverse.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines containing disqualifying and mitigating conditions to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance 
eligibility. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, 
the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor 
for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy 
guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B for foreign influence<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> and Guideline C for foreign preference,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> with their respective 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, are most relevant here.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, an

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline B, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Financial interests in other countries are also relevant if they make an individual 
potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In every security-clearance case an applicant's connections to any foreign country deserve careful examination.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> Common sense suggests that such 
connections do not deserve the same level of scrutiny, however, as a foreign country whose interests are known to be hostile or inimical to the U.S., or a foreign 
country with an authoritarian or totalitarian government. I have merely reviewed Applicant's connections to the U.K., along with the other record evidence, 
with these commonsense principles and realities in mind.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Here, based on the record as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline B. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 8<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> applies based on 
Applicant's financial interests in the U.K., which now consists of a retirement fund valued at about $50,000. His financial connections could create a potential 
to make Applicant vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by undue foreign influence.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> None of the other disqualifying conditions apply given the 
record evidence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On the other hand, Applicant has eliminated all of his financial interests in the U.K. except for the retirement fund, which appears unlikely to happen due to 
legal restrictions. This asset is less than 9% of his net worth<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> and is minimal compared with Applicant's U.S. financial interests. Moreover, in the foreseeable 
future, the value of this asset should be a smaller percentage of his net worth because the U.S. financial interests should increase in value. Of course, like any 
rational person, Applicant is not anxious to lose $50,000. Nevertheless, he could walk away from the U.K. asset without materially harming or affecting his 
family's overall financial position. Accordingly, the remaining U.K. asset is not of such magnitude to affect Applicant's security responsibilities, and so, 
mitigating condition (MC) 5<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> applies in his favor. None of the other mitigating conditions apply given the record evidence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the sake of argument, had I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR, I would have applied DC 1<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> based on Applicant's immediate family 
members (mother, brother, and sister) who are British citizens residing in the U.K.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> And as the record evidence currently stands, I would have applied MC 1<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> 
in Applicant's favor. Had the hearing been continued as I planned on ruling, I can only presume, based on counsel's good-faith representation, Applicant would 
have produced additional evidence about his immediate family members resulting in giving MC 1 additional weight. Given the record evidence, the security 
concerns posed by Applicant's immediate family members in the U.K. are, in my view, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>de minimis</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To conclude, considering the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I decide Guideline B for 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM>Section 2-Foreign Preference</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline C, the security concern is if a person acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to U.S. interests. In particular, the exercise of dual citizenship raises a security concern because 
it may indicate a preference for that foreign country. Mere possession of dual citizenship by itself, however, is not automatically a security concern. It depends 
on whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through the active exercise of dual citizenship or through other actions.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline C. Applicant demonstrated a foreign preference, after 
obtaining U.S. citizenship, by possessing a British passport. The same is true for Applicant's one-time use of the British passport in May 2000. Both actions 
constitute exercising dual citizenship and deserve serious consideration. In addition, the remaining retirement fund is of some concern as well since it was 
funded, in part, by the U.K. government. These matters, coupled with Applicant's long-term British citizenship and other connections to the U.K., raise security 
concerns and justify applying DC 1,<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> 2,<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> and 4.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> None of the other disqualifying conditions apply given the record evidence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Turning to the mitigating conditions under Guideline C, MC 1,<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> 2,<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> and 4<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> apply in Applicant's favor. Each will be discussed in turn. First, MC 1 applies 
because Applicant's British citizenship is based on his birth in the U.K. as opposed to a case where an adult U.S. citizen obtains citizenship in another 
country.<A HREF="01-21238.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> 
<P> As Applicant put it during the hearing, he is British by birth, but American by choice. Second, MC 2 applies because Applicant's acceptance of 
retirement benefits from the British government, through the funding of his company pension plan, took place before he became a U.S. citizen. Moreover, the 
British retirement fund has not received contributions from any source since December 1992 when he left that job for his current employment. Accordingly, the 
conduct is far from recent. Third, MC 4 applies because Applicant has expressed a willingness to renounce his British citizenship. Because his willingness is 
conditional, however, I have given this mitigating condition only some weight. The remaining mitigating condition does not apply given the record evidence.</P> 
<P>In addition to the formal mitigating conditions under Guideline C, Applicant also receives credit in mitigation by surrendering the British passport. By doing so, 
he has greatly reduced the potential risk of unverifiable foreign travel. Surrendering the British passport also makes it unlikely that his exercise of dual 
citizenship (by possessing and/or using a foreign passport) will continue or recur in the future. And surrendering the British passport demonstrates a preference 
for the U.S. over the U.K. </P> 
<P>To sum up under Guideline C, Applicant lived and worked in the U.K. until the age of 33, and he used a British passport once after obtaining U.S. citizenship. 
Nevertheless, the totality of his actions clearly shows a genuine preference for the U.S. over the U.K. as demonstrated by the following: </P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>Deciding to make the U.S. his permanent home after his initial 18-month assignment.</LI> 
  <LI>Marrying an American citizen in December 1991. </LI> 
  <LI>Leaving his long-term employment with the British company in December 1992 and going to work for an American company in January 1993.</LI> 
  <LI>Having two children, both native-born U.S. citizens, and not seeking dual citizenship for either child.</LI> 
  <LI>Choosing to become a U.S. citizen and swearing allegiance to the U.S.</LI> 
  <LI>Possessing and using a U.S. passport.</LI> 
  <LI>Liquidating or eliminating his financial interests (with the noted exception), including his former residence, in the U.K. </LI> 
  <LI>Building a home here.</LI> 
  <LI>Participating in his state's prepaid college plan. </LI> 
  <LI>Accumulating more than $500,000 in net worth in the U.S.</LI> 
  <LI>Registering to vote and voting. </LI> 
  <LI>Paying state and federal income taxes.</LI> 
  <LI>Surrendering the British passport.</LI> 
<P>And it is my commonsense assessment that Applicant's ties or connections to the U.K., while significant at one time, are no longer a significant part of his life. 
Any remaining ties or connections to the U.K. are substantially outweighed by his significant connections to the U.S. Accordingly, I decide Guideline C for 
Applicant.</P> 
<P>To conclude, after weighing the record evidence as a whole and giving substantial weight to the whole-person concept, Applicant has successfully mitigated the 
foreign influence and foreign preference security concerns. Applicant has overcome the case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion as to 
obtaining a favorable clearance decision.</P>
