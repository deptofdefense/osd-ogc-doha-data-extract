<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U>STATEMENT OF CASE</U></P>

<P>	On June 10, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January
2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be
denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer to the SOR on June 19,
1996.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on July 9, 1996. A notice of hearing was issued
on November 21, 1996, and the case was heard on December 6, 1996.  The Government and
Applicant submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from Applicant and two
witnesses. The transcript was received on December 23, 1996.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the
documents<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> and the live testimony. (Tr.). The SOR alleges Criterion J (criminal conduct).
Applicant admitted all allegations.</P>

<P>	Applicant is 39 years old and employed as a ---------------- by a defense contractor. He
seeks a secret level clearance.</P>

<P>	Applicant believed one of the causes of his criminal record was falling in with the wrong
crowd. (Tr. 49). In addition, the criminal conduct was drug-related. (Tr. 51).<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Applicant
acknowledged inconsistencies between GE #2 and GE #5 but has been trying to block the entire
incident out of his mind over the years. (Tr. 87-95).<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> </P>

<P>	Applicant was arrested on February 21, 1975 for (1) delinquency, (2) disorderly conduct,
(3) resisting arrest, and, (4) uncontrollable. He was found guilty of all charges and given six
months probation and ordered to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA).<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A>  On May 14, 1975,
Applicant was 18 years old when he was charged with (1) burglary, felony, (2) attempted theft,
felony, and (3) possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of felony. He was found
guilty of burglary and sentenced to 3 years in jail, but the entire sentence except for 10 days was
suspended, and Applicant was placed on 3 years probation. On September 3, 1975, Applicant
was charged with (1) conspiracy, and (2) burglary, both felonies. He was found guilty of burglary
and sentenced to three years; the entire sentence was suspended except for 6 months. He was
given probation for the balance of the term and ordered to pay court costs.</P>

<P>	On April 18, 1976, Applicant was charged with attempted burglary and possession of
marijuana. He was found guilty of attempted burglary and sentenced to one year in jail.<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	On May 3, 1976, Applicant was charged with (1) three counts of felony theft, and, (2)
three counts of burglary. He was found guilty of 3 counts of burglary and sentenced to one year
in jail, sentence to run concurrent to the sentence in the preceding paragraph. Applicant
burglarized the house of a drug using friend and took the friend's drugs and food and money. (GE
#2).</P>

<P>	On September 7, 1977, Applicant was charged with felony theft. He was found guilty and
fined. Applicant was a shoe store stock person at the time. He was caught selling the stock at
below the advertised cost and pocketing the proceeds of the sale.</P>

<P>	On November 7, 1979, Applicant was charged with (1) first degree murder, murder first
degree when engaged in the perpetration of kidnaping or robbery, (3) arson of motor vehicle, (4)
kidnaping, (5) robbery, (6) assault and battery, and (7) conspire to rob. Applicant was found
guilty and sentenced on November 18, 1980 to 30 years in prison and ordered to pay $70 court
costs. (GE #3). He is on parole until the year 2006. On November 11, 1978, after spending
several hours with the deceased using K.W. (a drug similar to PCP, GE #5), Applicant and two
accomplices attacked, robbed and killed him. The three accomplices split the victim's money and
drugs and Applicant kept the credit cards and the special knife. Applicant went to work part of
the next day and used the credit cards to buy clothes and a watch. (GE #5). Approximately a year
later, Applicant was arrested for the murder and made a statement. (GE #5).<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Applicant was paroled on December 21, 1989, and is still required to make regular visits
to his parole officer. </P>

<P>	On May 24, 1992, Applicant was charged with driving while under the influence (dwi). 
Applicant missed a court date, and a bench warrant was issued on October 4, 1992.<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> He was fined
$130 and ordered to serve 150 hours of community service. Applicant explained he had been
drinking at a graduation party and should not have been driving. He was pulled over on the same
street he lives on. </P>

<P>	After his 1989 parole, Applicant spent a little time with his parents until he moved in
with a retired truck driver in 1990 and lived there for approximately four and one-half years. (Tr.
109).  Applicant disclosed his criminal past within a week after he moved into the truck driver's
house. (Tr. 109). The truck driver and his wife entrusted the house and his three sons to
Applicant for an entire month. (Tr. 112).</P>

<P>	Applicant courted his wife for 18 months, and has been married to her for 18 months. (Tr.
117). He has been a steadying influence on his wife's two sons from a previous marriage. (Tr.
120). His strong work ethic provides a good example for them in their school work. Applicant
obtains computer programs to facilitate her children' learning. (Tr.122).</P>

<P>	The project manager hired Applicant in June 1995. The senior systems engineer finds
Applicant an excellent performer who is extremely motivated. A colleague has known Applicant
for 6 years and considers him a good instructor who exhibits patience with students.</P>

<P>	On May 24, 1987, Applicant received his associate's degree while in prison. (Exhibit C).<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>
He received 3 additional citations or commendations (including his college degree) in 1993. He
is currently taking courses toward his master's degree. (Tr. 73-74).</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive set forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's
reliance on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of
fact, must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to
evaluation of the facts in this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct (Criterion J)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	2. a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. the crime was not recent.</P>

<P>	2. the crime was an isolated event.</P>

<P>	5. there is clear evidence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>			<STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the
Directive) include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) The presence or
absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and,
the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an
applicant may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative
Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in
the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion J (criminal
conduct)  which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct
and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to the sufficiency of
proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is
unlikely to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	A case under Criterion J has been established as Applicant exhibited a pattern of criminal
conduct between 1975 and 1979 that clearly raises doubt about his judgment, reliability and
trustworthiness. Although Applicant was a juvenile in February 1975, he clearly exercised poor
judgment in disrespecting his parents in their own house. In May 1975, Applicant had reached
the age of 18 and promptly burglarized a drug store. In September 1975, Applicant committed a
second burglary and was given a second chance at probation (he was first given probation in May
1975) which he violated in less than a year for the second time. Applicant received only a one
year sentence for the attempted burglary set forth in subparagraph 1d. Applicant was convicted of
a subsequent burglary in May 1976 (subparagraph 1e) but received another break because the
sentence was ordered to run concurrent with the sentence in subparagraph 1d. In September
1977, Applicant was apprehended again for a retail theft when he decided to sell the merchandise
at his arbitrary price rather than the store price.</P>

<P>	Even before the murder in November 1978, Applicant's criminal conduct was serious
because  of the pattern and his lack of respect for the law. The dominance of drugs in Applicant's
lifestyle is exemplified by the burglary in May 1976 where Applicant burglarized an associate's
dwelling to secure repayment of a loan. He took money, drugs and even food.</P>

<P>	Applicant's repeated theft offenses are compounded by his involvement in the kidnaping
and murder in November 1978. His first mistake was being involved in the crime. The second
mistake was not telling law enforcement about the crime until he was arrested more than a year
later. Applicant's attempt to water down his involvement definitely undercuts his overall
credibility.</P>

<P>	On the other hand, the evidence persuades me to conclude Applicant was genuinely
remorseful for his role in the murder and recognized the gravity of the misconduct. Against the
heinous nature of the crime are the positive steps Applicant has taken over the years in making
himself a productive member of society and in rehabilitating his credibility. First, instead of
laying fallow in prison, he accomplished two objectives by obtaining his high school diploma
and his associates's degree. After his discharge from  prison in December 1989, Applicant
continued his education and received his college degree in 1993. He is currently working toward
a post-graduate degree.</P>

<P>	Applicant has been gainfully employed since August 1990. He worked for the university
for  almost five years. After working at another job for about three months he has been employed
in his current job for 18 months. He enjoys the support of his project manager and senior systems
engineer.  Applicant demonstrated good judgment and responsibility when he lived with the
truck driver. His present wife has known Applicant for 3 years and has been his wife for 18
months. She is enthused by Applicant's beneficial impact on her two sons. In addition to his job
performance and the positive influence on his stepchildren, Applicant has complied with all the
terms of his parole term. Even though there remains an added motivation to stay on the right side
of the law until 2006, I strongly believe nine years of incarceration and the evidence of
rehabilitation, particularly Applicant's efforts to continue his education both in and out of prison,
reinforces the ultimate conclusion Applicant's criminal past, which ended almost 19 years ago,
will not recur in the future.<A HREF="96-0362.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> The government exhibits shall be identified as (GE #) and Applicant's exhibits shall be
identified by the letter of the exhibit.
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> The equivocal testimony concerning the role of drugs in his criminal conduct undercuts
Applicant's credibility to some degree. (Tr. 73; 103). He continued to use drugs in prison until
1983. (GE #2). 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A> There are distinct inconsistencies between GE #5 (statement taken in September 1979)
and GE #2 (taken in March 1996). GE #5 shows Applicant was a much more active party in the
commission of all crimes he was charged with.
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>Applicant was 17 years old at the time. (Tr. 46).
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A> Applicant explained he tried to break into a liquor store. He began hammering on a glass
window but the stick he was using was too small. (GE #2).
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A> The murder occurred in September 1978. The police did not arrest Applicant until a year
later because of information he had provided to a friend some time after the murder. (Tr. 103).
He was remorseful for the crime and relieved as he provided the details. (Tr. 58).
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A> Applicant was actually served the bench warrant on October 4, 1992 during the course
of an arrest for another unalleged traffic incident. (Tr. 96). 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A> He also received his high school equivalency degree. (GE #2).
<P><A NAME="N_9_">9. </A> The alcohol-related incident is isolated as there is no evidence of recent conduct of a
similar nature. The last time Applicant engaged in similar conduct before May 1992 was in 1983
when Applicant was in prison.
