<P>Applicant's excessive use of alcohol and poor personal conduct evidenced by his arrest for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol in July 2001, has been 
mitigated by sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 26, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 26, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was transferred 
to the undersigned on April 26, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 28, 2004, scheduling the hearing for June 24, 2004.  At the hearing the 
Government presented four exhibits.  The Applicant presented four exhibits and called one witness.  He also testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript 
(Tr.) was received on July 13, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 30 years old and has a high school diploma and some college.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Inspector of Plastic Parts 
Development, and he seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Criterion G - Alcohol Consumption)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 19, 2001, the Applicant went to his cousin's house for a social gathering.  During the four hour visit, he consumed two 22 ounce malt liquor beers.  The 
Applicant had nothing to eat before he consumed the alcohol.  During his drive home, the Applicant was pulled over by the police for speeding.  The Applicant 
was administered the sobriety test, and subsequently arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs and Driving with .08% or more 
Blood Alcohol.  The Applicant pled no contest to Driving with .08% or more Blood Alcohol, and the charge of Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs 
was dismissed on August 30, 2001.  The Applicant was sentenced to a three month First Offenders Program.  This program required the Applicant to complete 
96 hours of community service, 36 months probation, pay a fine of $1,191.00 or perform twelve days of Cal Trans and enroll in an Alcohol Education Program.  
The Applicant successfully completed all the court's sentencing requirements.  The Applicant explained that the Alcohol Education Program consisted of 
eighteen hours of group sessions, twelve hours of educational classes, six self help recovery meetings and four individual interviews as well as being exposed to 
the dangers of driving under the influence of alcohol and its consequences.  The Applicant remains on probation for the offense until August 29, 2004.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of the conviction, the Applicant's driver's license was suspended for thirty days.  It was then restricted, allowing him to drive only to and from his 
place of employment for six months.  The Applicant fully complied with these conditions.  The Applicant testified that he has not consumed alcohol and driven 
since his arrest for DUI.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In regard to his present level of alcohol consumption, the Applicant testified that, "I rarely drink anymore.  I'll have like one if I know I'm going to be there for 
like, at a house or a restaurant or something, eating dinner or something.  Once in a while.  Every so often.  I don't get drunk or anything like that."  (Tr. p. 38).    
 </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerning whether the Applicant will drink and drive again, he credibly testified that, "Because I have learned from this experience.  And I wish it wouldn't 
have gotten to this point.  I just would never do it again.  I understand the consequences.  Just not only that but other people could get injured.  I'll never do that 
again."  (Tr. p. 38).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In regard to his future consumption of alcohol, the Applicant stated, "I'm probably just going to stop drinking, your honor. Its just coming to that.  I just have so 
much responsibility, I just have so much to lose.  That's where I'm looking at in the future."  (Tr. p. 41).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Numerous letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from his  supervisor, coworkers, family and friends indicate that the Applicant is 
considered to be a person of exemplary character, honesty, integrity, responsibility and high morals.  In the employment environment, he is considered a reliable 
employee with great knowledge of his job, and a vital part of the organization.  Among his friends and family, he is well respected by many and considered to 
be an excellent role model.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Exhibit A).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's wife testified that the Applicant is trustworthy and responsible and that he no longer consumes alcohol and drives.  (Tr. p. 19).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant appears to have taken his DUI experience very seriously and is committed to maintaining a positive sober attitude in life and a devoted 
dedication to his work and family.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline G Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . .</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgement.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination."  The Administrative Judge can draw only 
those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in repeated instances of alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has abused alcohol (Guideline G) and engaged in 
poor personal conduct (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Considering all 
of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, a failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance 
holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an Applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private 
affairs, there then exists the possibility that he or she may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>The evidence shows that the Applicant was arrested in July 2001 for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.  He remains on probation for the offense until 
August 2004.  Other than this one arrest, he has no alcohol related history and he has never been arrested before.  Since the arrest, the Applicant has complied 
with each of the courts sentencing conditions.  The Applicant appears to understand the consequences of his actions and the fact that consuming alcohol to 
excess is extremely self destructive.  For the past three years he has not consumed alcohol to excess or driven a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.  
He has learned that he cannot drink and drive in the future without a severe penalty, that may effect his security clearance and his employment.  He has recently 
decided that in the future it would be best for him not to consume alcohol.  He appears to understand the responsibilities that come along with the holding of a 
security clearance and the privilege that it is.  Based on the totality of the evidence, and the fact that the Applicant had decided to stop his consumption of 
alcohol altogether, it is unlikely that he will ever have another problem like this in the future.  Therefore, I find that he is sufficiently trustworthy to handle 
classified information.  The Applicant's alcohol consumption at this point does not establish doubt about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
itigating condition 3 under Guideline G applies.  Mitigating Condition 5 under Guideline E also applies.  Accordingly, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) 
and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are found for the Applicant. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence 
supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>
