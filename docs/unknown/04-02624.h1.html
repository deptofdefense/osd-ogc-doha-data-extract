<P>Applicant is a 61-year-old truck driver working for a defense contractor. Through the 1990s, Applicant accrued a number of debts that lead him to a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy in 2000. In an electronically completed security clearance application in 2002, there is a negative answer to a question inquiring whether he had 
filed bankruptcy. Applicant has substantially paid off his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and he successfully established that the bankruptcy information was 
administratively transcribed from a 1999 application without his knowledge. Applicant has mitigated the financial and personal concerns raised. Clearance is 
granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On December 15, 2004<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) concluding it was unable to 
find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a notarized statement, dated December 30, 2004, 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He denied six of the seven allegations raised under Guideline F and denied the sole allegation raised under 
Guideline E. Additionally, he waived his right to an administrative hearing in favor of a decision based on the written record. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM),<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> dated February 15, 2005. Applicant was provided a complete copy of the FORM, which 
was apparently mailed on February 21, 2005.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant received the complete copy of the FORM on March 25, 2005,<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and timely responded with additional 
material,<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> dated March 25, 2005. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's answers to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 61-year-old truck driver for a defense contractor. He has been with his current employer since 1999. He is divorced and has two children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Starting around 1994, when he divorced, Applicant began experiencing financial difficulties that increased throughout the 1990s. In May 1999, he changed 
employers. That June, he personally completed a written Security Clearance Application (SF-86) and gave it to his employer. The application, however, was not 
forwarded for processing at that time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Due to unexplained conditions in the 1990s,<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant's finances became unwieldy. He found it difficult to pay his bills on an income of approximately 
$34,000, and, at some point, feared he might lose his home. Eventually, Applicant decided to file for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy protection. The petition was filed 
on July 6, 2000. Included in the bankruptcy were debts in the amount of $5,076 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax year 1998, $5,021 to the IRS for 
tax year 1999, $1,712 to his state for tax year 1999, $1,800 for a returned check to one casino, and $6,925 for returned checks to another.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant states that the returned checks are ones he cashed at the casinos in order to loan a friend cash. The checks, he maintains, were returned for non-sufficient funds and the friend never paid the loans back. He included them in the bankruptcy on the advice of his lawyer after the debts had increased by close 
to 50% owing to fines and penalties.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Additionally, in the court's accounting of Applicant's financial condition, there is a notation for $24,586 in gambling 
losses<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> which is counterbalanced with $24,586 in gambling winnings,<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> thus yielding a zero sum gambling loss. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In total, the bankruptcy encompasses $62,604 in liabilities against a court-appraised $11,798 in assets. Under the bankruptcy plan, Applicant was to pay the 
bankruptcy trustee in monthly installments over 60 months through a plan that expired in July 2005. Applicant regularly paid on the plan and, as of March 10, 
2005, he had a remaining balance of $1,056, with no delinquent payments due.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> That balance should have been satisfied by four payments of $264 each over 
the remaining four months in 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the interim, on March 26, 2002, Applicant signed and dated a United States of America Authorization for Release of Information (Release) form. On May 1, 
2002, at least a portion of a written SF-86 was completed by or for Applicant.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Then, an electronic version of the SF-86 was prepared and submitted for 
processing by Applicant's company on May 23, 2002. The electronic form noted that the subject had signed the form on March 20, 2002, but there is no actual 
signature in the electronic format. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The May 2002 electronic SF-86 includes a question regarding bankruptcy. To Question 33 ("<STRONG>Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy</STRONG>  In the last 7 years have 
you filed a petition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?"), the answer "No" is designated. Applicant specifically denies any 
knowledge of the electronically submitted SF-86,<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> claiming the information contained must have been copied by someone in the company from his 1999 
written version. He also states that he was recently told the company submitted the 2002 SF-86 for him after his original 1999 application was rejected.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As of the Spring of 2005, Applicant was financially stable. He is approximately one year away from retirement and has both his union pension and Social 
Security for future income. He states his current assets are about $40,000 and include multiple vehicles. As of January 2005, he had less than $7,000 in debts, 
including what remained of his bankruptcy balance. He had approximately $7,000 in the bank as of March 2005.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> With his bankruptcy paid off by now, his net 
income should be increased. For entertainment, he goes to local casinos once or twice a month. There, he spends approximately $50 to $100 per visit.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Additionally, each security clearance 
decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with 
the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and 
recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or 
undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will 
continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>:</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN>. <EM>The Concern</EM>:</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate 
security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). For clarity, I will discuss each separately.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Financial Considerations</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For various reasons, Appellant accrued a number of debts in the 1990s, leading him to declare Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Consequently, Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.2 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>), and FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC). Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2000. By 2005, he should 
have repaid the balance owed his bankruptcy trustee.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> Inasmuch as the debts at issue were multiple and the bankruptcy discharge was not expected to occur 
earlier than July 2005, neither FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>the behavior was not recent</EM>) nor FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>) applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant makes vague references to conditions mitigating his financial situation.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> Such references, left undefined, however, lack the specificity needed to 
demonstrate that they helped give rise to his financial problems. He does, however, point to his divorce as contributing to his financial problems, although 
without much specificity as to how. Inasmuch as he is a layman proceeding <EM>pro se</EM>, and since divorce rarely occurs without some financial repercussions, I find 
that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation</EM>)) applies to a limited extent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At no point in the case file is there any evidence that Applicant received financial counseling, either before or after the filing of his bankruptcy. Therefore, I 
cannot find that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control</EM>) applies<EM>.  </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other than references to a struggle to handle debt and to keep his home in the 1990s, the record does not indicate what efforts Applicant made to pay off his 
debts prior to 2000. In 2000, however, he chose to file bankruptcy. Although bankruptcy is not the preferred method for eliminating debt, it is a legally available 
option and is not prohibited by the guidelines. To his credit, he chose to contribute toward the satisfaction of his debt through Chapter 13 bankruptcy, rather 
than seek a clean sweep of his debts under Chapter 7 proceedings. Further, he apparently made it through 56, if not all, of the 60 months of payment to the 
bankruptcy trustee on schedule and without incurring any delinquencies. Taken together, I find that Appellant's choice of Chapter 13 bankruptcy and his record 
for completing his repayment plan demonstrate that FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts</EM>) applies.<EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, the Government is appropriately concerned with what initially appears to be a $24,586 gambling loss.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> Consequently, Department Counsel also argues 
that FC DC E2.A6.1.2.5 ([<EM>f</EM>]<EM>inancial problems that are linked to gambling, drug abuse, alcoholism, or other issues of security concern</EM>) applies. I disagree. By 
itself, and combined with the checks returned from two casinos, a $24,586 loss could indicate a problem larger than just financial difficulty; this is especially 
true since Applicant continues to visit casinos. Applicant, however, has demonstrated that this loss was a reported offset from $24,586 in reported winnings, 
amounting to a net sum of zero. This allays concerns that the wagering loss represents a financial problem.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Similarly, the returned checks were cashed in order 
to make a loan to a fellow casino guest, not for his own use, and were put into the bankruptcy as unpaid debts at the urging of his lawyer. Today, he is currently 
living within his means, looking forward to retiring on his union pension, and he has sufficient funds in the bank to cover his few debts. While it is true that he 
continues to gamble once or twice a month, gambling, <EM>per se</EM>, is irrelevant unless it can be directly linked to a financial problem.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> As for spending $50 to $100 
per occasion, this is not an unreasonable amount in comparison to current entertainment costs. In sum, with his debts addressed through Chapter 13 bankruptcy 
and his gambling issues explained, I find that Applicant has mitigated security concerns arising from financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>Personal Conduct</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Regulation sets out several potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on the May 2002 electronic SF-86 because Question 33 regarding bankruptcy was answered 
in the negative. Inasmuch as Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2000 and was paying the trustee in the Spring of 2002, a negative answer by Applicant in 2002 
would have been untrue. Consequently, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification 
of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness or aware fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) could 
apply. To make that determination, however, it first must be decided whether the negative answer on that electronic SF-86 was given or certified by Applicant 
after he had filed bankruptcy, or at least acknowledged by him through his signing that SF-86. This is pivotal because if that is the case, he answered Question 
33 falsely. If, however, that SF-86 was filed on his behalf, without his knowledge, and based on the information contained in his 1999, personally completed 
SF-86, the incorrect answer cannot be automatically attributed to him and the disqualifying condition cannot apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant states that he did not sign the May 2002 electronic SF-86 and that the answers must have been taken from his 1999 SF-86. The Government, on the 
other hand, argues that the form states it was signed by the Applicant and, therefore, he must have had the opportunity to correct the answer to Question 33. I 
disagree with the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1999, Applicant personally completed a written SF-86, but his employer did not submit it for processing at that time. Nothing more happened until March 26, 
2002, when Applicant was given a Release, a form regularly accompanying a SF-86, to sign. Two months later, another SF-86 was apparently attempted on 
ay 1, 2002, but what remains of that form is incomplete and lacks the pages bearing both Question 33 and a signature.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> Finally, an electronic version was 
submitted on May 23, 2002, but "signed" on March 20, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Release goes hand in hand with an SF-86 application.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> There is no logical reason to execute a Release prior to the completion of an SF-86. Here, the March 
26, 2002, Release was either meant to accompany the existent 1999 SF-86 or one of the not yet existent SF-86s of May 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The May 1, 2002, SF-86 is no longer intact, therefore, a signatory date cannot be discerned. The next version of the SF-86 was electronically generated on May 
23, 2002, and states that it was "signed" on March 20, 2002. If that form was "signed" on March 20, 2002, it is hard to imagine why the May 1, 2002, SF-86 
was drafted, and on what date it might have stated it was signed. To follow the Government's argument, one would have to believe that Applicant signed a 
2002 SF-86 on March 20, 2002, that was electronically composed two months later, then backdated to a March 2002 date.  Moreover, having a Release be 
signed and dated March 26, 2002, for a SF-86 allegedly signed on March 20, 2002, but which was neither existent nor completed until late May 23, 2002,<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
makes little sense - especially when the Release and an SF-86 are inevitably part of the same package.<A HREF="04-02624.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's acceptance of an electronically ascribed date and signature is somewhat narrow. An electronic filing does not auto-stamp itself; that 
information is provided by the one filling out the template. The existence of the intervening May 1, 2002, SF-86 and the lack of chronology of the documents at 
issue demonstrate Applicant's employer was not flawless in its handling of security clearance applications. Furthermore, having Applicant separately sign a 
Release one week after supposedly signing a SF-86 indicates that applications were not being processed efficiently. It is apparent that something irregular was 
happening with these various documents and that it was happening when they were in the possession of the company. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's theory, that the answers from his outdated 1999 SF-86 were administratively transposed to subsequent SF-86s he never saw, is far more plausible 
and demands far fewer mental gymnastics than the Government's assertion. Based on the facts, I find that Applicant did not personally sign the May 23, 2002, 
SF-86. Consequently, no disqualifying condition applies and I find in Applicant's favor with regard to SOR paragraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the "whole person" concept. Applicant is a mature man who found himself in 
financial straits and declared bankruptcy. He chose to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy and has demonstrated his ability to shoulder at least some of the financial 
burden, himself. As a pastime, he enjoys occasional gambling, usually at a moderate rate of $50 to $100 a visit. Noted in his bankruptcy paperwork, but readily 
explained, was a big win that was either lost, or which covered his losses. Regardless, it was a zero net gain and the evidence does not indicate that this was 
anything but an aberrant event. He has taken financial responsibility for the checks that were returned, and there is no evidence that they were anything but 
loans. As for the SF-86 at issue, it takes a strong leap of faith to conclude that an electronically ascribed "signature" necessarily means the application was

<P><A NAME="N_31_">31. </A> The SOR only points to the $24,586 loss (without noting the entry for an equal sum in winnings), the checks which were written to casinos, and the fact he

<P><A NAME="N_32_">32. </A> In its FORM at page 7, the Government refers to the incomplete SF-86, attached as Item 5, as "the original version of his security clearance application." 
The original application cited by Applicant, as the Government notes later on the same page, however, is the unproduced 1999 version of the SF-86, which was 
personally completed and signed by the Applicant at that time. 
<P><A NAME="N_33_">33. </A> The release form, itself, notes that the information released by virtue of the authorization is "for official use by the Federal Government <EM>only for purposes
