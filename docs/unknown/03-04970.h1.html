<P>Applicant is a personnel security specialist for a defense contractor.  He had a security clearance while on active military duty.  As part of his employment with 
the defense contractor, he completed a security clearance application for a security up-grade.  His credit report showed significant delinquent debt.  Applicant 
petitioned for discharge in bankruptcy after receiving the SOR and all his debts were discharged in bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy discharge did not relieve security 
concerns for financial consideration.  He did not list his delinquent debts, all tax liens, all repossessions, or judgments against him on the security clearance 
application.  Applicant knew he had past due debts, judgments, repossession, and tax lien so he deliberately omitted or concealed the relevant information with 
the intent to deceive.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 12, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 19, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations),  and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 24, 2004.  He admitted the allegations under Guidelines F and E and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge.  The request for a hearing was received by DOHA on June 28, 2004.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on 
November 17, 2004, and the case was assigned to me on November 19, 2004.  A notice of hearing was initially issued on November 24, 2004, for a hearing 
scheduled for January 6, 2005.  A notice of hearing termination was issued on December 20, 2004, because Applicant's former employer notified Department 
Counsel that Applicant was  no longer employed by them and did not require a security clearance.  Subsequently, Applicant's new employer notified 
Department Counsel that Applicant did require a security clearance and Applicant wanted to proceed with the hearing.  A new notice of hearing was issued on 
January 3, 2005, for a hearing scheduled for January 6, 2005.  The hearing was held on January 6, 2005.  Since this was the date of the original hearing, 
Applicant waived the 15 day notice provision.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Twelve government exhibits, three Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of the Applicant were received during 
the hearing.  The transcript was received on January 12, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 36 year old personnel security specialist for a defense contractor.  Applicant's employer considers him to be honest, reliable, and trustworthy.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  
Applicant had a security clearance while on active military duty.  As part of his employment with the defense contractor, Applicant submitted a security 
clearance application on June 7, 2002, to upgrade his level of security access.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  A credit report for Applicant showed significant delinquent debt.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Based on this 
report, the SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts under Guideline F totaling approximately $28,000, and four allegations under Guideline E for false or incomplete 
answers to questions on the security clearance application.  The delinquent debts included 2 tax liens, 3 judgments, and 2 repossessions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's debts were incurred both before and after he and his wife voluntarily left active military duty without immediate employment.  The debts were for 
credit cards and ordinary expenses, such as, telephone bills, trash collection service, and home gas utility service.  Applicant and his wife lost one full income in 
1997 when his wife left active duty and attended school part-time and worked part time.  Applicant also worked part-time jobs to increase their income.  Even 
though there was additional income from part-time work, there was no indication ordinary expenses or delinquent debts were being paid.  One car was 
voluntarily repossessed in 2000, because they could not make the payments.  Applicant left active duty in 2000, was unable to find steady full time employment, 
and held five jobs as well as part-time employment in two years.  During this time, he and his wife were experiencing marital problems and were unable to keep 
up with their debts.  A second car was voluntarily turned in for repossession in 2001.  They were finally divorced in 2002 after they had accumulated substantial 
delinquent debt.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not file state tax returns in 1998 and 1999.  Applicant was on active duty in the military and had both military and non-military income.  Since he 
was not a resident for tax purposes of the state, he was not liable for state income tax on his military income but was on his non-military income.  Since 
Applicant did not file a return with the state, the state did not know Applicant was in the military and placed a tax lien against Applicant for the entire amount 
of his income.  Applicant subsequently filed the tax returns for 1998 and 1999<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and he is due a refund for the two years.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not file a state tax return 
in the state he moved to after leaving active duty and that state also placed a tax lien on his property.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) in 2002 and admitted all of the delinquent debt.  He told the agent he 
would file bankruptcy for discharge from the delinquent debts.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  However, Applicant did not file for bankruptcy until 2004 because he did not have the financial 
resources to pay an attorney to file the bankruptcy petition for him.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He was discharged in bankruptcy on September 15, 2004.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  This discharge in bankruptcy 
satisfied all of Applicant's debts in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant answered "no" to question 38 on his security clearance application asking if in the last 7 years  he was over 180 days delinquent on any debts.  
Applicant answered "no" to question 39 asking if he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  At the time, Applicant was more than 180 days 
delinquent on 18 debts incurred within the last 7 years and thus currently over 90 days past due on the debts.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant answered "yes" to question 35 on his security clearance application asking if in the last 7 years he had any property repossessed for any reason.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He 
listed one repossession when there were two repossessions.  Applicant turned in cars for voluntary repossession twice when he was unable to make the 
payments for the cars.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant answered "no" to question 36 on his security clearance application asking if in the last 7 years he had a lien placed against his property for failing to 
pay taxes or other debts.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  In fact, Applicant had two tax liens from two separate states for failure to file and pay state income taxes.  One of the tax situations 
was not resolved until 2004 when Applicant filed a tax return with the state and was owed a refund.  The other state tax situation was resolved in bankruptcy.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant answered "no" to question 37 on his security clearance application asking if in the last 7 years he had any unpaid judgments against him.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  In fact, 
Applicant had 3 unpaid judgments against him from creditors.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not handle the family finances when he was married and was not fully aware of all of the delinquent debts of the family.  Most of the delinquent 
debts were incurred since the mid-1990s and were for ordinary or credit card expenses.  Applicant claimed he became aware of the extent of the indebtedness 
when questioned by the DSS special agent.  Applicant was aware of some of the delinquent debts, but not all of them, and the repossessions and the three 
judgments before completing the security clearance application on June 7, 2002.  Applicant knew he had financial problems but he did not try to learn the true 
state of his finances or obtain his own credit report.  After learning of the extent of his indebtedness, Applicant made little to no effort to contact creditors and 
paid only one of the creditors a few payments.  Applicant did not seek financial counseling.  He filed for bankruptcy to resolve his financial situation.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR:</P> 
<P>Under Guideline F (Financial Conditions ), a security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financial 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in 
one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Applicant's delinquent debts brings the matter within Financial 
Consideration Disqualifying Conditions Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.2 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>).  Applicant admitted to long term delinquent debts, repossessions of property, and judgments against him for failure to pay debts.  
He has a history since 1996 of not paying his debts and meeting his financial obligations.  The debts were for ordinary expenses and credit cards.  Applicant 
made little effort to keep up with his ordinary living expenses and to understand the extent of his delinquent debt.  After learning of the extent of his 
indebtedness, he made even less effort to contact creditors and try to resolve his indebtedness.  From 1996 to 2000, Applicant was on active military duty and 
working a part-time job.  His wife was also on active duty for part of this time and worked part time after leaving active duty.  There were financial resources to 
pay the bills.  Applicant's failure to even address them with the creditors shows an unwillingness to satisfy his debts.  Bankruptcy is a legal and permissible 
means of resolving debts.  Applicant's 2004 discharge in bankruptcy relieved him of the debts but does not preclude consideration of the security significance 
of the actions leading to the delinquent debts.<A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  Applicant's failure to address delinquent debts outstanding for as long as nine years until pressed to use 
bankruptcy because of security concerns shows Applicant's unwillingness to satisfy debts.  I conclude the disqualifying conditions have been established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant raises the potential application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the conditions that resulted in the 
behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, . . . divorce or separation</EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the individual initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  Applicant claims his delinquent debts arose because he and his wife left active duty, 
lost two full time incomes and then were divorced.  However, Applicant had incurred most of the delinquent debt, to include the two car repossessions, before 
leaving active duty.  The circumstances of his indebtedness were not beyond his control.  Applicant's lack of effort to learn of his credit problems and pay 
creditors for many years until forced by security concerns to turn to the legal and permissible remedy of bankruptcy shows a lack of good-faith effort.  I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns for financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), a security concern exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-04970.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicants failure to provide the correct responses to four questions on the security clearance application brings the matter 
under Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, 
personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,. . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .</EM>).  At the time he 
completed the security clearance application, Applicant knew he had past delinquent debts, judgments, tax liens, and repossessions.  He made no attempt to 
learn the true state of his finances so he could accurately complete the form.  He deliberately omitted, concealed or falsified relevant information concerning his 
delinquent debts, judgments, repossessions, and tax liens.  I conclude the personal conduct disqualifying conditions have been established. </P> 
<P>Applicant made no effort to correct or provide complete and accurate information on his finances to the DSS special agents.  At the hearing, he did not provide 
clear answers to questions  concerning his financial situation.  He could only state he had been discharged in bankruptcy.  He has not established any mitigating 
conditions under Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct 
information voluntarily</EM>); and Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with 
the facts</EM>).</P> 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P>
