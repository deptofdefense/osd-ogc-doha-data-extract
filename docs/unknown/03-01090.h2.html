<P>Forty-one-year old Applicant was arrested in 1980, when he was 18 years old, and charged with (1) possession of marijuana, (2) possession of cocaine, (3) 
possession of paraphernalia, (4) 13 counts of theft, and (5) four counts of breaking and entering.  Upon his pleas of guilty, he was convicted and sentenced for 
each charge individually.  The various sentences included periods of confinement of six months, 12 months, 18 months, and four years, much of which was 
subsequently suspended.  Applicant's total period of incarceration was clearly less than one year.  While the application of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 previously would 
have disqualified him from eligibility for a security clearance, the recently amended <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 no longer serves as an automatic disqualification in this 
case.  Clearance is granted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 16, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, written statement, dated October 28, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was 
assigned to, and received by, me on November 20, 2003.  A notice of hearing was initially issued on November 20, 2003, scheduling the hearing for December 
17, 2003, but it was subsequently cancelled.  Another notice of hearing was issued on February 23, 2004, and the hearing was held before me on March 17, 
2004.  During the course of the hearing, five Government Exhibits and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant) were received.  The transcript 
(Tr.) was received on March 29, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 16, 2004, I indicated that a person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past when there is a substantial indication of 
subsequent reform, remorse, or rehabilitation, and that under other circumstances, I could have concluded Applicant had, through evidence of extenuation and 
explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case, and the allegations of the SOR would be concluded in favor of Applicant.  But, 
</SPAN>Applicant's criminal conduct also fell within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He was convicted in a state court of several crimes and sentenced to 18 months and four years 
for two of those charges--terms which obviously exceed the one year period envisioned in the law as it stood at that time.  Furthermore, I noted that 
implementing guidance indicated such a sentence would disqualify persons with "sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time 
actually served.  Applicant was fortunate enough to have his prison terms reduced rather than actually served, but, by virtue of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, as it then 
existed, I concluded Applicant was not eligible for a security clearance.  Accordingly, on April 16, 2004, I </SPAN>issued a Decision in which I found that it was not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant subsequently filed a notice of appeal and submitted an appeal brief.  Department Counsel submitted a reply brief.  However, while the case was 
pending appeal, Congress amended 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  The Appeal Board considered the issue as to whether the amendments should be applied retroactively and 
ruled, in part, as follows:</P> 
 
<P>As a matter of fairness to the parties in this case and in recognition of the limits of the Board's authority under the Directive, the Board hereby remands the case 
to the Administrative Judge to allow the parties an opportunity--consistent with basic principles of due process--to present their views on the effect of Section 
1062 on Applicant's case.  On remand, the Administrative Judge must allow Department Counsel the opportunity to obtain guidance and direction from 
appropriate Department of Defense officials as to the legal effect of Section 1062 on pending cases and how the Department of Defense proposes to implement 
that statute.</P> 
 
<P>On November 22, 2004, I issued an Order to both parties affording them an opportunity to present their respective written views regarding possible retroactive 
application of the revised statute with such views to be received by me no later than the close of business on December 6, 2004.  Neither party responded 
directly to the Order.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Findings of Fact set forth in my initial Decision, dated April 16, 2004, are hereby incorporated herein as though they were expressly re-written below.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to each of the 
adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below<STRONG>.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  The memorandum provided policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precluded the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances.  The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or 
arine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information 
and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</P> 
 
<P>(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</P> 
 
<P>(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));</P> 
 
<P>(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</P> 
 
<P>(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</P> 
 
<P>The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."</P> 
 
<P>Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicated that provision 1, described above, "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and 
Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served."</P> 
 
<P>On October 9, 2004, Section 1062 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 was approved and adopted, amending 
portions of Subsection (c)(1) of section 986 of Title 10, United States Code, thereby altering it to read as follows:</P> 
 
<P>(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, <EM>and was incarcerated as a 
result of that sentence for not less than one year.</EM> (Emphasis of change supplied)</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="03-01090.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline J.  By his own admission, Applicant was involved in criminal activity in 1980, as described above, that 
resulted in his arrest.  Upon his plea of guilty, for one of the charges of possession of a controlled dangerous substance, he was sentenced to 18 months 
confinement and 36 months probation, with all but five months of confinement suspended; and for the other charge of possession of a controlled dangerous 
substance, he was sentenced to four years confinement, with all but five months of confinement suspended.  Applicant's criminal conduct clearly falls within 
Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was 
formally charged</EM>), CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>conviction in a Federal or State court, 
including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year</EM>).  I acknowledge CC DC E2.A10.1.2.3. has not yet been 
formally amended to conform with the recent change in the law, and no implementing guidance has yet been provided.  Nevertheless, in complying with the 
mandate that these security clearance review decisions be fundamentally fair commonsense decisions, I have concluded that the new law was intended to be 
applied retroactively.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The criminal activity of 1981, 1983, and 1984, is uncharged criminal conduct as it was not alleged in the SOR, and is discussed only for the purposes of 
describing the whole-person in the context of this security clearance review proceeding.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It has been approximately 24 years since the series of criminal conduct incidents began and slightly less time since Applicant was released from prison.  Since 
then, except for the activities of 1981, 1983, and 1984, Applicant has not been involved in any additional criminal conduct and has apparently turned his life 
around.  Those facts would seem to activate Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">B</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">y virtue of his spotless record since 1984, as well as his successful completion of substance abuse treatment, and his abstinence from further marijuana abuse 
since November 1980, there is substantial evidence of successful rehabilitation, thus activating CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>there is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation</EM>).  However, as the conduct in question occurred over a period of days in different cities, I cannot find that the criminal conduct was isolated as set 
forth in CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past when there is a substantial indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or 
rehabilitation.  Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's criminal conduct no longer falls within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While he was convicted in a state court of several crimes and 
sentenced to 18 months and four years for two of those charges--terms which obviously exceeded the one year period envisioned in the law at that time, those 
sentences were suspended and reduced, in part, to confinement for five months. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's actual period of incarceration was clearly less than one year.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Consequently, under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">the newly amended 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, Applicant is no longer automatically disqualified from eligibility for a security clearance.  
Considering all of the above, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the 
government's case.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR, are concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has not established its case under Guideline E.  Examination of Applicant's actions when he was 18 years old reveals a pattern of conduct 
involving questionable judgment and criminal conduct.  He was arrested and convicted of a number of crimes in 1980, but there is no evidence to support the 
government's contention that any of the crimes for which he was charged or convicted, stemming out of his criminal activity of 1980, were felonies.  In the 
absence of evidence, I refuse to speculate whether a crime for which a sentence of over one year was imposed by a state court was a felony.  Furthermore, 
neither the state court nor the FBI record identify the particular charges as felonies.  In this instance, it is understandable that the teenage defendant might not 
have known the crimes for which he was charged and convicted were felonies, and I accept his explanations regarding the same.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Likewise, while the 1983 charge of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">possession of dangerous drugs (psilocybin) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">was a felony, Applicant again denied knowing that fact.  Furthermore, the 
government was satisfied with his explanation and withdrew so much of the allegation that referred to the 1983 incident.  No Personal Conduct Disqualifying 
Conditions </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">apply in this case.  Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case 
with respect to the issue of personal conduct.  Accordingly, allegation 2.a., as modified, is concluded in favor of Applicant.  Allegation 2.b. was withdrawn by 
the government.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
