<P>Applicant's wilful failure to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 1995, and 1999 through 2002, in a timely fashion has caused excessive 
financial tax indebtedness and other financial problems that he has not resolved or mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On February 9, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 16, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on April 26, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on June 23, 2004, scheduling the hearing for July 26, 2004.  On July 23, 2004, two days prior 
to the scheduled hearing, the Applicant requested a continuance.  Applicant's request for a continuance was denied.  At the hearing the Government presented 
thirty exhibits.  The Applicant presented no exhibits, but he testified on his own behalf.  The record was left open after the hearing to allow the Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional documentation. The Applicant submitted one Post Hearing Exhibit, consisting of eleven enclosures of thirty-five pages.  The 
official transcript (Tr.) was received on August 17, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 64 years old.  He is unmarried, and has a Bachelors Degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is  employed by a defense contractor as an Electrical 
Engineer and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he violated a federal statute, 42 
United States Code, Section 4203 and a state Revenue and Tax Code Section 19701.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his conduct involves questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has been employed in the defense industry off and on from 1976 until the present.  Over the past twenty years, the Applicant has on numerous 
occasions failed to file his federal and state income tax returns in a timely fashion.  He also failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 
1995, and 1999 through 2002.  This has resulted in accrued delinquent back taxes that he has not been able to pay off.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1990 to 1992, the Applicant went through a divorce with his wife.  In 1993, he was laid off from his job.  In 1995, he was rehired.  The Applicant testified 
that he is a poor man and that he pays very high child support.  (See Tr. p. 41 and Government Exhibit 26).  He has not had the money to hire a tax preparer to 
file all of his delinquent returns.  He also donates heavily to churches and other religious organizations.  He drives a fourteen year old car.  He stated that he has 
filed several of his delinquent tax returns, for tax years 1995 through 2000, but he has still not filed his federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2001 
through 2004.  Before his divorce, his wife was diligent in seeing to it that the Applicant did things that he didn't do well on his own, such as making sure the 
income tax returns were filed.  However, the Applicant admits that they still had problems filing their taxes before the divorce.  After the divorce, the Applicant 
has struggled with completing these tasks alone.  The Applicant admits that he has had difficulties with tax forms.  (Tr. p. 68).  He states that he has always paid 
his taxes, his problem is with filing his income tax returns on time.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since about 1998, the IRS and the Franchise Tax Board have been garnishing the Applicant's wages to pay for his delinquent back taxes.  (<EM>See</EM> Government 
Exhibit 24).  The Applicant is uncertain as to what he currently owes the IRS or the Franchise Tax Board.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Numerous federal tax liens have been filed against the Applicant for delinquent back taxes.  In 1991, a federal tax lien was filed against him for tax year 1986, 
in the amount of $43,015.59.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 9).  In 1992, a federal tax lien was filed him for tax year 1987, in the amount of $40,424.59.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Government Exhibit 11).  In 1993, a federal tax lien was filed against him for tax year 1988, in the amount of $13,968.46.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 7 and 12).  
In 1994, the IRS filed a federal tax lien was field against him for tax years 1991 and 1992, is in the amount of $10,14650.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 13 and 14).  
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1998, the Franchise Tax Board also filed a state tax lien him in the amount of $12,348.75 for delinquent back taxes owed for tax year 1996.  (<EM>See</EM> 
Government Exhibit 20, 21, 22, and 23).       </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is also indebted to a number of other creditors including a physician, in the amount of $229.00, a medical association in the amount of $242.00, 
and a bank in the amount of $734.00. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Post Hearing Exhibit indicates that he recently filed his state income taxes for tax years 1999 and 2000.  Assuming that these returns have been 
filed, his returns for 2001 and 2002 have still not been filed.  The most recent documentation in the record from the state taxing authority, an earnings 
withholdings order dated July 2004, indicates that the Applicant owes approximately $17,670.41 to the state.  (<EM>See </EM>Applicant's Post Hearing Exhibit and 
Government Exhibit 25).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The most recent documentation from the IRS dated September 2003, indicates that no federal income tax returns were filed by the Applicant for tax years 1995, 
1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.  It also indicates that the Applicant has unpaid taxes for 1991 and 1992, which were years that he did not file a tax return.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  Personal Conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violations of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in financial irresponsibility  criminal conduct and personal misconduct which demonstrates poor judgment or 
unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F), engaged in criminal 
conduct (Guideline J) and poor personal conduct (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the 
Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a twenty years history of financial difficulties and serious tax indebtedness.  Some of his financial problems were brought on by his divorce 
and his job lay off.  Most of his problems, however, were caused by his own procrastination and financial mismanagement.  He did not file his income tax 
returns on any regular basis, allowing back taxes to accumulate over the years.  Numerous tax liens have been filed against him by the IRS and the state taxing 
authorities.  His wages are currently being garnished to pay his back taxes.  He has filed some of his income tax returns but not all of them.  It appears from the 
record that he still has actually not filed his federal income tax returns for 1995, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002, nor has he filed his state income tax returns for tax 
years 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.  The state taxing authority and the IRS do not have record of these filings.  The Applicant also owes several creditors that 
have been delinquent for several years and has made no attempt to pay the debts.  He has made some bad financial decisions.  By ignoring his tax indebtedness 
and other creditors for several years, the Applicant has shown poor judgment and unreliability.  He states that he is now trying to get himself back on track with 
his tax responsibilities, but he has only just begun the process. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, disqualifying conditions <EM>1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations, and 3.  An inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply.  None 
of the mitigating factors apply.  Under Guideline J, disqualifying conditions </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>1.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person 
was formally charged, and 2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses </EM>apply.  None of the mitigating factors apply. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, disqualifying 
conditions <EM>4.</EM>  <EM>Personal Conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail, 
and 5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violations of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency </EM>apply.  
None of the mitigating factors apply.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has excessive financial indebtedness that he has failed to resolve.  His  conduct shows very poor judgment.  Presently, the Applicant is not 
sufficiently responsible or trustworthy to hold a security clearance.  Accordingly, Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are found against him. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Government's 
Statement of Reasons.</SPAN></P>
