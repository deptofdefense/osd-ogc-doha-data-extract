  The Administrative Judge's material findings of fact about Applicant's history of financial difficulties are sustainable.  Applicant has not shown that the Judge's conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Board need not decide whether Judge's erroneous interpretation of a Board  decision on falsification is harmful error in this case because the Judge's conclusions under Guideline F are sufficient to support his unfavorable security  clearance decision.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 15, 2003, which stated the 
reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge James A. Young issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated 
August 5, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge's decision with respect to the financial consideration allegations 
is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding the Applicant's falsification of his security 
clearance questionnaire was deliberate.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether 
there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify 
how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 
00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or 
(2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary 
or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory 
explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it 
reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the 
record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) 
at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether 
they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not 
required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are 
supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the 
same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, 
Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, 
but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect 
a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party 
challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 
4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, 
Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG><A HREF="02-07751.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's decision with respect to the financial considerations allegations is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  
Applicant contends the Judge's decision should be reversed because: (1) Applicant's  federal and state tax indebtedness resulted from a circumstance 
beyond his control--problems with his wife's day care business, (2) his tax debts are not recent, not of security significance, and he is current on his 
other financial responsibilities, (3) prior to the receipt of the SOR, Applicant  paid off, or made payments on, or otherwise attempted to resolve most of 
his unpaid federal tax debts, and (4) there is currently no outstanding demand for payment for his state tax debts.  In support of his contentions, 
Applicant lists multiple purported errors in the Judge's findings and conclusions, including an assertion that the Judge erred by not finding that the 
Government failed to meet its burden of proving disqualifying conduct by substantial evidence.  Applicant also argues that his conduct should have been 
extenuated or mitigated under Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 1,<A HREF="02-07751.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 2,<A HREF="02-07751.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 3,<A HREF="02-07751.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 4,<A HREF="02-07751.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and 6.<A HREF="02-07751.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  The Board interprets Applicant's appeal brief 
as raising the issue of whether the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge's material findings and conclusions either: (1) do not reflect a reasonable or 
plausible interpretation of the record evidence, or (2) are not a legally sufficient application of Directive provisions.  Considering the record evidence as 
a whole, the Judge's material findings of fact are sustainable.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  Although Applicant 
strongly disagrees with the Judge's conclusions, he has not established that those conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  <EM>See</EM> 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Applicant had a pattern of repeated federal and state tax indebtedness over multiple years.  At the time the case was submitted for 
decision, he still had significant outstanding state tax debts.  Applicant had only finalized his arrangements with respect to his federal tax debts several 
days before receipt of the SOR--well after the initiation of the security clearance process.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably 
conclude that Applicant's financial problems were recent, not isolated, and still ongoing.  Likewise the Judge could also reasonably conclude that 
Applicant's promises to resolve his remaining state tax indebtedness and his recent efforts to resolve his federal tax indebtedness were not a substitute 
for a consistent record of timely remedial action.  Therefore, the Judge was not required as a matter of law to conclude Applicant's efforts to address 
his financial difficulties warranted application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6.</P> 
 
<P>The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge's decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  As 
the trier of fact, the Judge had to weigh the evidence as a whole, decide whether the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice 
versa</EM>, and conclude whether Applicant had presented sufficient evidence to satisfy his burden of persuasion under Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.15.<A HREF="02-07751.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  The Judge reasonably addressed the possible application of the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and 
explained why Applicant had not sufficiently mitigated the security concerns raised by his history of substantial, federal and state tax indebtedness.  
Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner 
that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  There is sufficient record evidence to support the Judge's conclusions.</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding the Applicant's falsification of his security clearance questionnaire was deliberate</SPAN>.  The Applicant 
contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application by failing to disclose his federal and state tax debts.  Rather, he contends 
the omission of the information in question was the result of "excusable neglect and oversight."</P> 
 
<P>In considering Applicant's challenge to the Administrative Judge's finding of falsification, the Board notes the Judge's decision contains a legally 
erroneous statement about Applicant's burden of proof.  Specifically, the Judge stated that the Board decision in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (June 9, 
2004) held that proof of an omission is sufficient to shift the burden of proof to an applicant to prove the omission was not a falsification.  The reasons 
why the Judge's statement reflects an incorrect reading of the Board's decision in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 are set forth in ISCR Case No. 03-09483 (November 17, 2004), and need not be repeated here.</P> 
 
<P>The Board does not need to decide whether the Administrative Judge's legal error is harmful or not under the particular facts and circumstances of this 
case.  The Judge's findings and conclusions under Guideline F are sufficient to support his unfavorable security clearance decision.  Accordingly, 
whatever conclusion the Board might reach about Applicant's claim of error concerning the Judge's finding of falsification would not change the result 
of this appeal.</P>
