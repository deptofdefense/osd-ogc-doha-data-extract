<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June 17, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 8, 2006, after the 
hearing,  Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey Anderson denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the 
Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines G and J is arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance should be reversed because Applicant's last criminal offense occurred in 2000 and he quit 
drinking in that year.  He further argues that he has since completed an outpatient alcohol program, refrained from abusing alcohol, returned to and completed 
his schooling, and has otherwise demonstrated changed circumstances and rehabilitation.  Applicant also asserts that although he admitted in his answer to 
consuming alcohol in excess and to the point of intoxication from 1999 to March 15, 2004, it was error for the Judge to make such a finding considering his 
testimony at the hearing.  Given the record of this case, the Board does not find these arguments persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  
Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. 
Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of 
fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  An 
applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to 
demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge found Applicant had a lengthy and serious history excessive alcohol consumption that included six alcohol related 
criminal offenses between 1989 and 2000.  She also found Applicant had been charged with twelve non-alcohol related offenses, some of which had ultimately 
been dismissed.  Finally, the Judge found that although Applicant had completed a two-year alcohol treatment program between 2000 and 2002, he continues to 
consume alcohol and has not been able to remain alcohol free for any extended period of time.  The Judge's material findings of security concern are 
sustainable.  Her conclusions are also sustainable.  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the 
disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions.  She reasonably explained why the evidence which the 
Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  The Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Given the 
record that was before her, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines G and J is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>
