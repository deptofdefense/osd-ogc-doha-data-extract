<P>Applicant was arrested several times between 1988 and 1991 for drug-related offenses related to his addiction to methamphetamine. His last arrest, for violation 
of his probation after testing positive for drugs, resulted in a two-year prison sentence. Available mitigation through time and change of circumstances is 
undermined by his deliberate falsification of his most recent security clearance application. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On June 18, 2004, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns stemming from criminal conduct. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on 
information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On July 9, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer),admitting the allegations in SOR  &para;&para;1.a,1.d, and 1.f. He also requested a determination without a 
hearing. On August 9, 2004, Applicant received a file of relevant materials (FORM) generated on July 26, 2004 by DOHA Department Counsel in support of 
the government's preliminary decision. Applicant did not respond to the FORM and the case was assigned to me on September 17, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old analyst employed by a defense contractor since June 2000. This appears to be his first application for a security clearance. He has 
been married since August 1992.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> In 1987, at age 19 or 20, Applicant was introduced to illegal drugs at a party. Over the next four or five years, he used 
methamphetamine about three times a week and progressed to the point where he was addicted to the drug.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was arrested in April 1988 and charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale, possession of a controlled substance, receiving stolen 
property, and possession of a loaded firearm in a motor vehicle. The firearm was the stolen property in question. Applicant was convicted of the latter three 
charges and the possession for sale charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 36 months probation thereafter.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>SOR &para;1.b alleges Applicant was arrested in October 1988 and charged with possession of a controlled substance. SOR &para;1.c alleges he was arrested in December 
1988 and charged with possession of a controlled substance and receiving stolen property. Applicant denies both allegations claiming he was in jail serving the 
aforementioned 90-day jail sentence after his arrest alleged in SOR &para;1.a. The SOR allegations in &para;1.b and &para;1.c are based on FORM, Item 6, an FBI report that 
lists these and other arrests. Applicant's claim he was in jail when he was alleged to have been arrested in December 1988 is solely by his uncorroborated 
Answer. Based on the available information, the October and December arrests would have occurred nearly 180 days from his arrest in April 1988,  more than 
enough time could have elapsed for Applicant to be convicted, sentenced and served his time. However, it is also possible the FBI report reflects different 
stages in Applicant's processing through the criminal justice system for the same offense. Further, there is no information about what surely would have been a 
violation of Applicant's probation from his April 1988 arrest had he been arrested in late 1988. In short, the government's evidence in support of SOR &para;&para;1.b 
and 1.c is inconclusive. I find for Applicant as to SOR &para;&para;1.b and 1.c.</P> 
 
<P>In March 1990, while apparently still on probation from his April 1988 arrest, Applicant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance. He was 
convicted and sentenced to 364 days in jail. After his release from jail, he was again arrested in May 1991 and charged with possession of a controlled 
substance, transporting a controlled substance for sale, and being under the influence of a controlled substance. In June 1991, Applicant was sent to state prison 
for two years because of his drug use while on probation. He actually served only nine months of this sentence.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>After his release from jail, Applicant pursued recovery from his addiction to methamphetamine. He attended a combination of Alcoholics Anonymous and 
Narcotics Anonymous for about three years and has not used illegal drugs since 1991.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Questionnaire (SF 86) in August 2000 after he was hired by his current employer. When answering questions about 
his criminal record, he deliberately omitted his most recent arrests because he did not want people at work to know about them.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> His supervisor and a co-worker speak highly of him and the quality of his work, but there is no indication either person knows anything about Applicant's past.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed under Guideline J (criminal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J (criminal conduct), a security concern exists where it is shown an Applicant is willing to disregard the law. Such conduct indicates an 
inability or unwillingness to abide by rules and procedures established to protect classified information.<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN> Department Counsel has presented sufficient 
evidence in the FORM to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline and I conclude Guideline J DC1<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 2<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply here.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
Applicant was arrested at least twice for drug-related offenses between 1988 and 1991. He spent a total of 24 months in jail over this period.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By contrast, Applicant has not been involved in any criminal activity for 13 years and appears to be a sober, contributing member of society. It is clear his 
activities were tied to his addiction to methamphetamine and that he has overcome his drug problem. Guideline J MC 1<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN> and MC 4<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> apply here. </P> 
 
<P>Guideline J MC 6<A HREF="03-20519.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">is also potentially applicable here. Applicant has been married for 12 years, is a father, and has been steadily employed since he left prison 
in 1992. Nonetheless, his deliberate concealment of his most recent arrests from his SF 86 is a violation of federal law (18 U.S.C. &sect;1001). Questions remain, 
therefore, about his rehabilitation and about his trustworthiness reliability within a security suitability context. Deliberate falsification of relevant and material 
information is criminal conduct and undermines the government's confidence Applicant will protect the nation's interests even when doing so may be adverse 
to his own interests. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Title 18 U.S.C. &sect;986 bars Applicant, absent meritorious waiver from the Secretary of Defense as provided for in 18 U.S.C. &sect;986(d), from holding a clearance 
because he was convicted of a crime and sentenced to more than one year in jail. </SPAN>However, a reasonable assessment of available information about Applicant's 
criminal conduct, independent of the aforementioned statutory prohibition, raises reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability or willingness to abide by rules 
and regulations in place for safeguarding classified information. Absent substantial information to resolve those doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I 
conclude the record evidence shows Applicant has not overcome the information supporting the government's decision to deny Applicant access to classified 
information.</P>
