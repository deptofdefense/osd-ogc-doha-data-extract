<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On November 24, 2004, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="03-16066.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-16066.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 
January 28, 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  On June 20, 2005, the case was assigned to me.  On August 22, 2005, I 
convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  At the hearing, 
the Government submitted eleven exhibits (Ex.), which were identified as Ex. 1 through 11, and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant submitted 
six exhibits, which were identified as Ex. A through F, and they were admitted to the record without objection.  On August 29, 2005, DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E , Personal Conduct and eight allegations under Guideline G, Alcohol 
Consumption.  Applicant admits all eleven allegations.  His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 46 years old and recently married.  (Tr. 9.)  He has been employed by a defense contractor as a program analyst for 4 &frac12; years.  He requires a 
security clearance to carry out the duties of his present job.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began to drink alcohol to excess and sometimes to the point of intoxication in approximately 1990, at the age of 31.  He was arrested on July 14, 
1990 and charged with two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol and one count of speeding. He was sentenced to participate in an accelerated 
rehabilitation disposition program for one year and ordered to pay fines and costs of $553.50 and to serve 80 hours of community service.  His driver's license 
was suspended for six months.  Thereafter, Applicant stopped drinking alcohol for approximately one year and attended  Alcoholics Anonymous meetings 
approximately once or twice a week. (Tr. 25-26.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the early 1990s Applicant moved to a beach resort.  He lived there intermittently.  In 1995 he took a job in a restaurant at the beach resort, where he worked 
as a manager, greeter, waiter, and bartender.  (Tr. 23, 27; Ex. 1, 2.)  On May 30, 1999, at approximately 2:20 am he was arrested and charged with driving while 
intoxicated.  His blood alcohol content was .30.  ( Ex. 7.)  Applicant subsequently pled guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended, and 12 months 
probation.  He was ordered to obtain a substance abuse assessment and to participate in treatment recommended as a result of the assessment.  He was also 
ordered to pay fines and costs of $236 and to complete 24 hours of community service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Approximately 14 hours later, at 4:05 pm on May 30, 1999, Applicant was arrested again and charged with driving while intoxicated (Count 1) and driving 
while license revoked (Count 2).  His blood alcohol content was .28.  (Ex. 8.)  He pled guilty to both counts.  On Count 1, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail, 
suspended, and supervised probation for two years.  He was ordered to pay fines and costs of $723.50.  On Count 2 he was sentenced to 14 days in jail, 
suspended, two years probation, and was ordered to pay $186 in fines and costs.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In June 1999, Applicant received alcohol-related detoxification treatment at an unidentified facility.  On July 15, 1999, at another facility, he received the 
substance abuse assessment ordered by the court.  The assessment revealed substance abuse with alcohol and marijuana.  Applicant was diagnosed as alcohol 
dependent by a certified substance abuse counselor who was also certified as a clinical supervisor.  (Ex. 10.)  Pursuant to the diagnosis, it was recommended 
that Applicant participate in six months of alcohol-related treatment.  (Ex. 6.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 15, 1999, Applicant's sister picked him up at the beach and drove him to another state, where was admitted to a hospital for emergency services 
related to alcohol detoxification.  He remained in the hospital until September 21, 1999.  (Exs. 3; 9.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed an intensive three-month alcohol safety education program on May 22,  2000.  He also successfully completed a 40-hour out-patient 
substance abuse treatment program. He attended the program from April 5, 2000 until April 19, 2001.  (Ex. 5.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant identifies himself as an alcoholic (Tr. 27) and attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings frequently.  He has an AA support group and an AA 
sponsor.  (Tr. 35.)  His most recent drink of alcohol, one beer, occurred  approximately one year ago.  (Tr. 37.)  He says he has no plans to drink alcohol in the 
future.  (Tr. 38.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant last drank to intoxication in 1999.  His longest period of abstinence from alcohol was three years.  (Tr. 39.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began using marijuana in the early 1990s.  He used it approximately once a week during that time.  His last use of marijuana occurred approximately 
in May 1999. (Ex. 3; Tr.30-31.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed and certified a security clearance application (SF- 86) on May 30, 2001 (Ex. 1 and 2.)  Question 24 on the SF-86 asks if an applicant has 
ever been charged with or convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs.  In his response to Question 24, Applicant replied "yes" and listed one offense, 
which he identified as driving while intoxicated on May 30, 1999.  He stated his license was suspended for the offense. (Ex. 1.)  Applicant did not list his 1990 
arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol, nor did he list his second arrest on May 30, 1999 for driving while intoxicated.  On April 9, 2002, in a signed, 
sworn statement to a special agent of the Defense Security Service, Applicant admitted his failure to list two of his three alcohol-related arrests on his SF-86.  
(Ex. 3.)  At his hearing,  Applicant acknowledged the omissions and attributed them to his denial about his use of alcohol. (Tr. 41-42.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 27 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for 
example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, 
methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription drugs?"  In his response Applicant was instructed to list the duration and 
frequency of any illegal drug use.  Applicant responded "no" to Question 27.  In his signed, sworn statement, Applicant  said he did not intend to falsify his 
answer to question 27.  (Ex. 3, at 1.)  At his hearing, Applicant stated: "I will say that I agree with all the Government's case and I truly deceived them in my 
first attempt to get a clearance."  (Tr. 9.)  Applicant also acknowledged his false answer to Question 27 was intentional, in order to protect himself from 
admitting illegal conduct.  (Tr. 44.)  He revealed his drug use when it was raised at his security interview by the Defense Security Service special agent. (Tr. 
44.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 30 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "In the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related 
treatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?"  Applicant answered "yes" and listed treatment he received from April 2000 to April 2001.  
He did not list two alcohol detoxification treatments he received in June 1999 and from September 15 to 21, 1999.  In his signed sworn statement, Applicant 
admitted multiple alcohol-related treatments but denied he intended to mislead by failing to list all of them. (Ex. 3, at 3.)  At his hearing, Applicant stated the 
treatment he listed on his SF-86 in response to Question 30 had been successful.  He said he did not consider the detoxification treatments in June and 
September 1999 to be successful.  He said his actions in not reporting the unsuccessful treatments were "deceiving and yet truthful in the sense that the real 
treatment" had been the one he listed on his SF-86.  (Tr. 45.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted copies of his performance appraisals for 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005. (Ex. B, C, D, and E.)  His manager noted on his 2005 performance 
appraisal that Applicant's "devotion to ensuring our tracking system for receipt of hardware and software in support of . . . system deliveries continues to be 
excellent."  (Ex. B, at  4.)   Applicant also submitted a copy of his resume (Ex. F.) and an e-mail, dated February 7, 2002, from a person at a government agency 
where he had worked as a contractor complimenting his work ethic and professional attitude.  (Ex. A.)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions  and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In 
evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No.

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant raised concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, by falsifying material facts in his responses to Questions 24, 27, 
and 30 on his SF-86.  DOHA alleged that Applicant admitted and listed only one alcohol-related offense in his response to Question 24 when he knew he had 
been charged with two additional alcohol-related offenses which he did not list. (&para; 1.a.)  DOHA also alleged Applicant falsified his response to Question 27 
when he answered "no" to illegal drug use and failed to list his occasional use of marijuana until at least 1999. (&para; 1.b.)  DOHA also alleged Applicant falsified 
his response to Question 30 by admitting and listing only one episode of alcohol-related treatment when he knew he had received alcohol-related treatment on 
two other occasions which he did not list.  (&para; 1.c.)  Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive 
&para; E2.A5.l.l. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR , the Government has established its case.  Applicant's failure to answer Questions 24, 27, and 30 
completely, truthfully, and correctly raises a security concern under &para; E2.A8.1.2.2. of Guideline E.  At his hearing, Applicant attributed his failure to list two 
alcohol-related arrests in his response to Question 24 to his feelings of denial about his use of alcohol. He further stated he did not answer Question 27 
truthfully because he did not want to admit illegal conduct. He averred he did not answer Question 30 truthfully because he did not consider two of his alcohol-related treatments to be successful and thus did not list them in response to Question 30.  Applicant's concealment of information he considered embarrassing 
or which made him feel uncomfortable could make him vulnerable to coercion and blackmail. &para; E2.A5.1.2.4.  His conduct raises additional concerns under &para; 
E2.A5.1.2.5 because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's reticence to reveal the truth about his past conduct suggests that, under 
some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government.  The ability to be truthful goes to the essence of an individual's security 
worthiness. It is well established that embarrassment is not a mitigating condition under the Directive.  ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.10, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply to the facts of this case: the information  Applicant withheld is pertinent to a determination of his judgment, 
trustworthiness, and reliability.  Only one other mitigating condition under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern raised by 
Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsifications were isolated, not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently provided the correct 
information voluntarily. &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  While Applicant supplied the correct information when questioned by a special agent of the Defense Investigative 
Service approximately eleven months after he completed his SF-86, the falsifications were not isolated incidents and they are recent.  Accordingly, allegations 
in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline G that Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to intoxication from at least 1990 to 1999 (&para; 2.a.); that 
he was arrested July 14, 1990, and charged with two counts of driving under the influence of alcohol and one count of speeding, which resulted in the 
suspension of his driver's license for six months, his placement in an accelerated rehabilitation disposition program for one year, and an order for him to pay  
fines, costs, and serve 80 hours of community service (&para; 2.b.); that he was arrested on May 30, 1999 at 2:20 am and charged with driving while intoxicated; that 
he pled guilty to the charge, resulting in a sentence of 60 days in jail, suspended, 12 months probation, an order to obtain a substance abuse assessment, to 
participate in any recommended treatment, and to pay fines, court costs, and complete 24 hours of community service (&para;2.c.); that he was arrested on May 30, 
1999 at approximately 4:05 pm and charged with one count of driving while intoxicated (DWI) and one count of driving while license revoked, to which he 
pled guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended, supervised probation for two years, and ordered to pay fines and costs on the DWI count, and was 
further sentenced to 14 days in jail, suspended, two years probation, and ordered to pay fines and costs on the driving while license revoked count (&para; 2.d.); that 
he received alcohol related detoxification treatment in June 1999, at an unknown facility (&para; 2..e.); that he received a substance abuse assessment in July 1999 
and was diagnosed with alcohol dependence, resulting in the recommendation that he attend six months of alcohol-related treatment (&para; 2.f.); that he was 
hospitalized and received alcohol-related detoxification treatment from September 15 to September 21, 1999 (&para; 2.g.); and that he received alcohol-related 
treatment from April 2000 to April 2001 from a community substance abuse services facility (&para; 2.h.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted all the allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline G.  A security concern under &para;&para; E2.A7.1.2.1 and E2.A7.1.2.5. is raised by 
Applicant's admissions that he has consumed alcohol to excess and by three alcohol related incidents away from his workplace in 1990 and 1999.  Excessive 
alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, and failure to control impulses, thereby increasing the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the result of his two alcohol-related arrests on May 30, 1999, Applicant was ordered to obtain a substance abuse assessment.  His substance abuse 
assessment was rendered on a form which indicates he was diagnosed in July 1999 as alcohol dependent by a person identified as a therapist at a mental health 
center.<A HREF="03-16066.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The documents submitted by the Government establish the diagnosing therapist as a state-certified substance abuse counselor and a clinical supervisor 
but do not establish that he was "a credentialed medical professional (<EM>e.g.</EM>. physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist)" and therefore qualified to render a 
diagnosis of alcohol dependence as required by &para; E2.A7.1.2.3. of Guideline G.  Additionally, the therapist's credentials fail to establish that he was a licensed 
clinical social worker who was a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program, as required for rendering an evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence under &para; E2.A7.1.2.4. of the guideline.  Thus, the Government's evidence fails to establish that security concerns in this case are raised under &para;&para; 
E2.A7.1.2.3 and E2.A7.1.2.4.of Guideline G.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant identified himself as an alcoholic and admitted to undergoing two alcohol-related detoxification treatments in July and September 1999.  He received 
alcohol-related treatment from April 5, 2000 to April 19, 2001, and his counselor reported he had successfully completed the treatment.  He attends AA 
meetings at least once a week and often more frequently.  He has an AA support group and an AA sponsor. His most recent drink of alcohol, one beer, occurred 
approximately one year ago. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He has not drunk to intoxication since 1999.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns raised by Applicant's Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the alcohol related incidents do not indicate a pattern (&para; 
E2.A7.1.3.1), the problem with excessive alcohol consumption occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem (&para; E2.A7.1.3.2.), 
and if Applicant shows positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (&para; E2.A7.1.3.3.).  Applicant's disqualifying conduct could also be mitigated if, 
following a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, he successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare 
requirements, participated frequently in meetings of A A or a similar organization, abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and received a 
favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.  (&para; E2.A7.1.3.4.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On three occasions, one in 1990 and two in 1999, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated.  The two arrests in 1999 occurred on the same day, 
suggesting perhaps a crisis rather than a pattern in Applicant's life.  Applicant's alcohol-related conduct occurred six years ago and has not been repeated.  
Applicant recognizes he has a problem with drinking alcohol, and he has successfully completed substance abuse treatment and attends AA meetings 
frequently.  His present conduct demonstrates that if a pattern of negative behavior existed in the past, it does not exist now.  Thus, I conclude mitigating factors 
E2.A7.1.3.1. and E2. A7.1.3.2 apply to Applicant's case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has stated he has a strong desire to live a productive and alcohol-free life.  To his credit, Applicant has taken positive steps to change his behavior 
and has chosen sobriety as his goal, demonstrating that mitigating factor E2.A7.1.3.3 is applicable.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has successfully completed outpatient rehabilitation and participates frequently in AA meetings.  He has abstained from alcohol for a period of 
approximately one year.  He is committed to sobriety.  While nothing in the record indicates Applicant has received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed 
medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program, his conduct since 1999 suggests he 
has taken charge of his problem and intends to remain sober.  Because the record suggests that a credentialed medical professional did not render Applicant's 
diagnosis of alcohol dependence and apparently has not supplied a follow-up prognosis, I conclude I cannot apply mitigating factor E2.A7.1.3.4. to the facts of 
this case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec.27, 1999), DOHA's Appeal Board states that an administrative judge, in deciding an Applicant's security worthiness, 
"must consider the record as a whole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>."  I 
have considered the Guideline G allegations in the SOR and the record as a whole.  I have evaluated Applicant's conduct under the whole person concept of the 
Directive.  I conclude that under the whole person concept, Applicant has successfully mitigated  the security concerns alleged under Guideline G of the 
Directive.  Allegations 2.a. through 2.h. of the SOR are concluded for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, because he failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline E of the Directive, Applicant has not successfully overcome the 
Government's case opposing his request for a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
