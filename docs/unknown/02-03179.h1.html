<P>Applicant, an employee of a defense contractor incurred extensive debts arising in large part from a divorce after 21 years of marriage. Some debts have been 
paid but others were not including a $47,000.00 deficiency debt for repossession of her home. Applicant wrote the creditor only a few days before her final 
answer to the allegations raised by the security clearance denial to request a payment schedule. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On December 17, 2002, the Defense Office of  Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Information Within Industry, 
</EM>as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated January 23, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have her case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on May 14, 2003. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation , extenuation, or 
mitigation. She did so on June 18, 2003. The case was assigned to, and received by, this Administrative Judge on June 30, 2003. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted three of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations under Guideline F. Those admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. She has denied the remaining five. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the 
following additional findings of fact are made.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant's debts arose from the breakup in 2000 of a 21 year marriage leaving her with family to support, no educational training for a good income producing 
job, and debts that have not been paid. These included an extensive debt of $47,000.00 from the repossession of the family home and over $4,000.00 of credit 
card debt owed to two companies.(SOR 1 a, b and c) She has paid five smaller debts totaling $1,500.00. (SOR 1 d, e, f, g and h) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant corresponded with the creditor for the debt on the home in August and November 2002 but only inquired about a payment schedule in a letter of June 
15, 2003. </P> 
 
<P>Her former husband has a record of unsteady employment. Although he is legally obligated for half of the debt for the home, it seems problematic that he is 
willing or able to pay his share. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Since the separation and divorce Applicant has completed a computer science engineering course and is now employed by a defense contractor with an 
opportunity for further advancement. She has received several awards and commendations from her employer for her work. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN>Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10,865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12,968 &sect; 3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12,968 &sect; 3.1(b)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The applicable Guideline cited in the SOR concern the following Disqualifying Conditions (DC): </P> 
 
<P>Financial Considerations Guideline F:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations or an inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy his debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include the fact that the behavior was largely beyond the person's control, that he has received counseling, and 
that he has initiated good faith effort to repay creditors and resolve debts. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government has established reasons to deny her a security clearance because of 
financial considerations. Having established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, 
mitigates, or extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 
99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The financial considerations alleged as a Disqualifying Condition (DC) 3 under Guideline F are based on a series of debts arising from Applicant's separation 
and divorce that she was unable to pay. Mitigating Condition (MC) 3 is applicable in that the conditions were largely beyond her control and as a result of her 
divorce. (E2.A6.1.3.3)</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant has manifested motivation to straighten out her problems including her debts and taken some steps to resolve the smaller debts cited in the SOR. Her 
financial problems were largely caused by the breakup of her marriage and her need to obtain qualifications for better employment. She has now become a 
qualified computer sciences engineer but still has extensive unresolved debts primarily arising from the repossession of her home. </P> 
 
<P>She wrote to the three remaining creditors only three days prior to filing her answer to the FORM to inquire about a payment schedule and thus had no 
information from them to submit in her answer.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The statements of Applicant in her answer to the SOR and response to the FORM are persuasive as to the cause of her financial difficulties and her efforts to 
resolve them. However, the fact that such a large debt is still unresolved with no specific plan to accomplish a repayment except the possibility of a better 
paying job with her employer is not sufficient to overcome the considerations raised by the government as grounds for denial of a security clearance. Thus, it 
would be premature to grant a security clearance at this time to the Applicant. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal Findings as required by the Executive Order No. 10,865 &sect; 3, &para; 7 (<EM>See </EM>Directive, &para; E3.1.25), are as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1.  Guideline F :   AGAINST APPLICANT</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>After full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
