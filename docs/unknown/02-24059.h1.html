<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts he incurred in 2001 and 2002 while underemployed.  The debts total over $20,000.00 and still remain significant 
after some efforts  to repay them. While Applicant is to be encouraged in identifying and contacting his creditors in the past year, his repayment efforts remain 
too much a work in progress to make any safe predictable judgments at this time about his debt resolution prospects.  Applicant fails to mitigate security 
concerns associated with his delinquent debts.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On July 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 15, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 16, 2004, and received it on February 3, 2004.  Applicant  responded to the FORM within the 30 days provided him 
with supplemental documentation regarding his finances.   The case was assigned to me April 29, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated a number of delinquent debts: three in all that exceed $20,000.00.  For his answer to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted each of the allegations with explanations and attachments detailing payments and payment arrangements with two of the listed creditors.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 33-year-old software developer for a defense contractors  who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During prior periods of unemployment, Applicant accrued personal debt that he could not keep up with his limited resources.  Following his layoff from a 
defense contractor in September 2001 he worked various part-time contracts for the ensuing six months, which did not produce enough income to pay all of his 
debts.  Among the debts he permitted to become delinquent during this period of very limited employment were the three debts owed to creditors 1.a through 
1.c.  Altogether, these debts exceed $20,000.00.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After receiving the SOR, Applicant contacted his old creditors and was successful in paying the entire balance owed to one creditor (creditor 1.b).  With one of 
the two remaining creditors, he was able to complete a payment arrangement (creditor 1.a).  He documents making one $50.00 payment in July 2003 on this 
debt, but no more.  Applicant provides no time line as to how he expects to repay this $8,000.00 plus debt.  He has been unsuccessful, too, in completing any 
kind of settlement arrangement with his third creditor (creditor 1.c), to whom he owes over $7,800.00. By his response to the FORM, he indicates he has not 
been able to make any further progress in repaying his debts since he lost his current job due to the lack of an interim clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1.  The behavior was not recent.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debt in 2001 and 2002 following his layoff. The three debts of concern to the Government exceed $20,000.00, and 
have been only partially paid down since the issuance of the SOR in January 2003.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite his more recent efforts to identify and work on his old debts, Applicant remains obligated to two of the major creditors listed in the SOR, save for one 
identified payment to creditor 1.a in July 2003. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> On this record, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial 
considerations apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's accrued debts are accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>lack of steady good paying work following his layoff in 2000), for 
the most part his finances have permitted modest attempts to pay on his old creditors with the resources available to Applicant after he joined his most recent 
defense contractor in April 2002.  Besides the listed creditors he describes, he does not identify what past due creditors he addressed after returning to full time 
employment in 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are neither extenuated nor mitigated enough to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His six months 
of underemployment in 2000-2001, while problematic, does not appear to have been so prolonged as to preclude his addressing his delinquent debts when he 
returned to work with his most recent defense contractor.  Extenuation is not demonstrated sufficiently to enable him to invoke MC 3 (conditions largely 
beyond the person's control) of the Guideline.  While he has paid one of the three delinquent debts and made a payment on a third one, his overall repayment 
efforts remain a work in progress and insufficient at this time to invoke any of the mitigating conditions of the Guidelines, primarily MC 6 (initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) based on his repayment efforts.   The Appeal Board has counseled against according much weight to belated efforts to 
address delinquent debts well after the security clearance process has been initiated.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-33581 (July 20, 2004).  Also, where there is 
insufficient evidence of repayment efforts after the conditions that contributed to an applicant's delinquent debts have passed, the Appeal Board has cautioned 
against crediting the applicant with either non-recent financial difficulties (MC 1 of the Guidelines) or excuse from addressing his delinquent debts (even those 
accrued because of extenuating circumstances).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (September 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To Applicant's credit, he has since taken steps to identify his creditors and accept responsibility for some of his debts.  At the same time, he provides no viable 
repayment plan with his current resources.  And his efforts to date are not of sufficient strength to enable him to mitigate security concerns associated with his 
longstanding delinquent debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his debts in the past, and 
recent efforts in identifying and addressing his debts, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c. , of the allegations governed 
by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraph 1.b of the allegations covered by the 
Guideline.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E: 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
