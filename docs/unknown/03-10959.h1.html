<P>Applicant was charged with rape (four counts) in 1988, and with rape and statutory burglary in 1990. The 1988 charges were nolle prossed, and he was found 
not guilty of the 1990 charges. Applicant failed to disclose these criminal charges and a January 2001 arrest for disorderly conduct in a security clearance 
application he submitted in March 2001. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern that has resulted from the criminal charges brought against him 
and the false he provided. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 14, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline D (sexual conduct) and Guideline E (personal conduct). Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR dated 
October 27, 2003. He admitted being charged with the criminal offenses that underlie the sexual conduct SOR allegations and provided explanations for the 
reasons why the charges were filed. He also admitted his family did not know about the charges and that he did not want them to know about them.  Although 
he admitted providing incorrect answers in the security clearance application he submitted, he denied the answers were deliberate attempts to deceive. 
Applicant requested a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on April 29, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on May 20, 2004, scheduling the hearing for June 7, 2004. The hearing was 
conducted as scheduled.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7, and admitted into the record without an objection. 
Applicant testified at the hearing but did not submit any documentary evidence. The transcript was received on June 17, 2004.        </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make 
the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 40-year-old man who has been employed as an operating engineer by a government contractor since March 2001. He served in the United States 
Navy from February 1986 to December 1996, and received an Honorable Discharge while serving in the rank of Petty Officer 3, (paygrade E-4). He was twice 
promoted to the rank of Petty Officer 2 (paygrade E-5), but each time suffered a reduction in rank at a Captain's Mast (the naval term for punishment imposed 
pursuant to Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice). Both rank reductions resulted from assaults Applicant committed against fellow Sailors. The last 
Captain's Mast occurred in 1996, and was the motivation for Applicant leaving the Navy. He worked steadily at a variety of jobs between the time he left the 
Navy and his current job, including seven months with his present employer in 1997 before he was laid off.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was married in August 1991, and divorced approximately two years ago (he does not recall exactly when the divorce was finalized). He has five 
children between the ages of 9 and 19, including a son who is a product of the relationship that resulted in rape charges being filed against him in 1988. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Applicant was charged with four counts of rape in March 1988. The charges were based upon a consensual sexual relationship he had with a 15-year-old girl 
while he was 23 years old that resulted in her becoming pregnant. Applicant testified he met the girl in an adult nightclub and was unaware that she was 
underage when he was having sexual relations with her. On July 6, 1988, the charges were nolle prossed. Applicant maintains an active father-son relationship 
with the child he fathered during this relationship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged in July 1990 with rape and statutory burglary. Applicant explained in his SOR answer he was dating two women who lived next door to 
each other at a university. After engaging in sexual intercourse with one of the women, he told her he had to leave to go visit the second woman who was 
awaiting his return. The first woman called police and claimed Applicant had broken into her apartment and raped her. Applicant was found not guilty of both 
charges in a jury trial concluded on March 7, 1991.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on January 18, 2000, charged with driving on a revoked license and other traffic offenses, fined $50.00, and assessed $138.00 in court 
costs. He was charged with disorderly conduct on January 21, 2001, after his wife called police and alleged Applicant was following her on a state road. The 
charge was dismissed by the district attorney on September 12, 2001. He was again charged with disorderly conduct on September 5, 2001, for an incident 
involving a police officer and the principal at his children's school wherein he apparently lost his temper and swore at them in the presence of the children. That 
charge was dismissed by the judge when he appeared in court.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">        </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant signed a security clearance application (SF 86) on March 20, 2001, in which he answered "No" to questions 21: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Police Record - Felony 
Offenses - Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense? . . . . </EM>and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM> 26: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Police Record - Other Offenses - In the last 7 years, have 
you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.00 
unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.) . . . .</EM> His answer to question 21 was incorrect in that he was required to list the 1990 rape and statutory 
burglary charges, both of which were felonies.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> His answer to question 26 was incorrect in that he was required to list the January 2001 disorderly conduct 
charge.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a statement to a contract investigator for Defense Security Service on November 16, 2001, in which he stated the following about the 1990 
criminal charges:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> This is the most painful event that has ever occurred in my life. I can't begin to explain the amount of hurt and pain that this has caused me. My family and 
friends don't know that this has happened. I was willing to never mention this to anyone because it is embarrasing [sic] and disgraceful. I don't know how you 
explain something to someone that you didn't do. People tend to make judgment regardless of the facts.  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline D, 
pertaining to sexual conduct and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Sexual Conduct</SPAN>.  Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual 
to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant engaged in a consensual sexual relationship in 1988 with a 15-year-old girl while he was 23 years old that resulted in her becoming pregnant. His 
testimony that he believed the girl to be of consenting age based upon the location where he met her is credible, however, it does not provide a defense to the 
criminal charge.<A HREF="03-10959.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> The record does not contain any explanation for the disposition of the charge, although there is evidence that it was done in contemplation 
that the girl was to pursue a civil suit against Applicant seeking to collect child support. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, 
whether or not the individual has been prosecuted</EM>; and DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment 
</EM>apply to this conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The only record evidence concerning the criminal charges brought against Applicant in 1990 is (1) he was charged with rape and statutory burglary; (2) he was 
found not guilty of the charges at a jury trial; and (3) his explanation that the charges were brought by a vindictive paramour after he told her he was going to 
visit another female shortly after they had engaged in sexual intercourse. While there is insufficient evidence to establish that DC 1 applies to this conduct, the 
result clearly establishes the applicability of DC 4. Further, such crass conduct, and the fact that Applicant's family is unaware of the charges and his expressed 
desire to keep them unaware of them, forms an adequate basis for applying DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all Mitigating Conditions (MC) under Guideline D, and find that only MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of 
subsequent conduct of a similar nature </EM>applies. Applicant was 23 and 26 years old when the two rape charges were brought against him, so MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior 
occurred during or prior to adolescence . . . </EM>is inapplicable. The two Captain's Masts during the 1990s and the traffic and disorderly conduct arrests that 
occurred between January 2000</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>and September 2001 prohibit a finding that MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
emotional instability</EM> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Lastly, the fact that Applicant's family is unaware of the sexual charges that were filed in 1990, his desire to keep them unaware of those charges, and his 
failure to disclose the charges in the SF 86 he submitted in March 2001 demonstrates his desire to keep that part of his life confidential at all costs. The 
testimony he provided about the hostility displayed towards him by people in the Navy following his arrest, even after he was found not guilty, and how he 
believes people will view him in a negative fashion if they find out about the charges explains his motivation for wanting to keep everyone unaware of the 
charges. Those facts prohibit a finding that MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress </EM>applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant's failure to disclose the 1990 rape and statutory burglary charge and the January 2001 
disorderly conduct charge in the SF 86, and the explanations he has provided in an attempt to justify the non-disclosures severely undermine the ability to place 
trust and confidence in him at the present time, and raise significant security concerns.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In his SOR answer, Applicant indicated he didn't know if the rape and statutory burglary charges were felonies or misdemeanors, which is impossible to accept 
considering the very nature of the charges, that he was represented by an attorney in the proceedings, and that they were resolved at a jury trial where he 
unquestionably had to be aware that he was facing a severe sentence if convicted. He also indicated in his SOR answer and in his hearing testimony that he 
didn't think he had to list the charges because he was found not guilty of them. However, question 21 makes clear it is seeking information on arrests and 
charges regardless of the disposition, with the sole exception of certain drug offenses for which an order of expungement has been entered. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant failed to provide an explanation for not disclosing the January 2001 arrest in his SOR answer. During his hearing testimony, he indicated that either 
he assumed the security officer who prepared the SF 86 knew about the arrest and didn't include it and that he then signed the form without noticing the 
omission, or she actually knew about the arrest and failed to include it and he then signed the form without noticing the omission. Significantly, the charge was 
actually pending when he executed the SF 86, not being dismissed until September 2001. His attempt to shift responsibility to the security officer and then 
indicate he did not notice the omission is not credible.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> applies in this</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN>case. And again, the fact that Applicant's family is unaware of the sexual 
charges that were filed in 1990, and his desire to keep them unaware of those charges warrants finding that DC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of 
information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the 
person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>to blackmail </EM>applies</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. </EM>I have considered all Mitigating Conditions 
under Guideline E and none apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns present in this case. 
Guideline D and Guideline E are decided against Applicant.  </SPAN></P>
