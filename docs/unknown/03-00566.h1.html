<P>Applicant's possession and use of a foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen demonstrated a foreign preference and was not mitigated where Applicant 
had neither surrendered the passport or obtained formal approval for its use. She intends to retain the passport and her foreign citizenship because of the 
employment attendant thereto. Given Applicant's demonstrated preference for her foreign citizenship and her residence there, her foreign relatives by both 
blood and marriage leave her potentially vulnerable to foreign influence. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 21 July 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-00566.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Applicant's 
undated response answered the SOR and requested an administrative decision on the record. On 24 November 2003, Applicant responded to the File of 
Relevant Material (FORM)--issued 20 October 2003. The record closed on 14 January 2004, the date Department Counsel indicated no objection to the 
response. The case was assigned to me on 22 January 2004.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the FORM, Department Counsel moved to delete subparagraph 1.a. (alleging Applicant's dual citizenship) and renumber it as subparagraph 2.b.--under 
Guideline C. I grant the motion.        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for subparagraph 1.c. which she clarified by stating that the listed relatives live in Germany; accordingly I 
incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. She has not previously held a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the U.S. in 1970. From her father--a German national who immigrated to the U.S. in 1969--she derived German citizenship. She 
appears to have exercised no aspect of her dual citizenship until she relocated to Germany.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was raised in the U.S., but later relocated to Germany. The record is unclear when or why she first moved to Germany, but her clearance application 
reflects that she has lived at the same address in Germany since July 1995. However, she has been employed in Germany since at least March 1995, working in 
a garden center until May 2001 when she went to work for her current employer. The application also suggests that she may have resided in Germany since at 
least Fall 1990.<A HREF="03-00566.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to her clearance application, Applicant married a German national in September 1998, although they separated in April 2001.<A HREF="03-00566.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> However, she 
obtained a German passport in October 1998, valid until October 2008. She acknowledged her dual citizenship on her clearance application and she has stated 
that she asserted her German citizenship as a matter of convenience, to skirt the strict German requirements for foreign nationals seeking work permits in 
Germany. She is  unwilling to surrender her German passport or renounce her German citizenship because of the difficulties in remaining in Germany 
otherwise. She has not obtained U.S. Government approval for possession or use of her German passport.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The German national that Applicant married was from a family that has known Applicant's family since the grandparent's generation was in elementary school. 
In addition to her husband, Applicant's in-laws are German citizens residing in Germany and she has two aunts, an uncle, and a cousin who are German citizens 
residing in Germany.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record contains no character references or information on Applicant's work performance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern:<EM> </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum<A HREF="03-00566.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> to clarify 
the application of Guideline C, Foreign Preference, to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport. In pertinent part, the ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum 
</SPAN><STRONG>"requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the 
appropriate agency of the United States Government."</STRONG>(Emphasis added).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an applicant's 
fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the 
disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant was born a U.S. citizen, she derived German citizenship from her father.  Her passive foreign citizenship possesses little security 
significance if based solely on derivation from her father. For Applicant's conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, Foreign Preference, she 
must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on the interests of 
the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
those entrusted with this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen. Under this 
assessment, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline C and Applicant has not mitigated the security concern.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant claims to prefer her U.S. citizenship, her conduct suggests otherwise. Although her reasons for relocating to Germany are not clear, it is clear 
she was employed on the economy before being hired to work for her current employer. Certainly, by 1998 she had asserted her claim to German citizenship to 
obtain a German passport. She is unwilling to surrender her passport or to renounce her German citizenship. Her reasons of convenience boil down to her 
legitimate interest in being able to remain employed in Germany.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum resolves the foreign preference issue. The Money Memo states that Applicant's past possession and use of her foreign passport can 
be mitigated only if she surrenders the foreign passport or obtains U.S. Government approval for its use. Applicant has undertaken neither action and does not 
intend to do so. Applicant's suggestion by that the Money Memo is not legally binding on me is contrary both to the plain language of the memo and prior 
Appeal Board rulings on this issue.<A HREF="03-00566.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Because Applicant meets neither of the mitigating factors under the Money Memo, additional analysis of the remaining 
mitigating conditions (MC) for foreign preference is unnecessary.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant has a legal right to maintain her dual citizenship with its attendant benefits and responsibilities--and indeed her maintenance of dual 
citizenship may be quite prudent given the realities of modern society--she has not demonstrated that she can be counted on to always act in preference to the 
United States. I resolve Guideline C against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, Appellant may be subject to foreign influence because she has relatives to whom she is clearly bound by ties of affection living in Germany as well. 
</SPAN>Given Applicant's demonstrated preference for her foreign citizenship and her residence in Germany, her foreign relatives by both blood and marriage leave her 
potentially vulnerable to foreign influence. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I resolve Guideline B against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>The so-called "Money Memo" because it was signed by Arthur L. Money. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>In similar fashion, the Applicant's argument that NATO SOFA provisions provide a basis for me to grant Applicant's clearance is simply wrong. First, there 
is nothing in the NATO SOFA that permits me to ignore binding security adjudication guidelines. Second, it may be true that all the employees of Applicant's 
company fall outside the NATO SOFA definitions of which civilian component employees may be accorded "member of the force" benefits--largely because 
Applicant's company does not perform the kind of highly technical work required to otherwise qualify for such treatment. Nevertheless, this fact is irrelevant to 
an assessment of Applicant's eligibility for a clearance. Finally, Applicant could never have qualified as a member of the civilian component (even if the 
company had such status) for the simple reason that at the time she was hired, she was already a German national and had been "ordinarily resident" in 
Germany for some time, two specific bars to her being accorded member of the force status.
