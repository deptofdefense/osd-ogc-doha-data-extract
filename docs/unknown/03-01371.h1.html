<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor who incurred approximately $25,000.00 in delinquent debts to six credit card companies. At the 
time of the filing of her answer to the SOR she showed evidence of payment or settlement of three of the debts totaling almost $10,000.00 and subsequently 
submitted documentation as to the remaining debts to show that she had settled, or paid the other accounts. Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 22, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry ,</EM>as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated November 18, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided on the written record 
in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on March 23, 2004. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material 
(FORM), consisting of six documents, was provided to Applicant by letter dated March 24, 2004. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and 
submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did so on April 8, 2004. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted three of the specific allegations of delinquent debt and denied three others in the SOR in her answer. After a complete and thorough review 
of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She incurred approximately $25,000.00 in delinquent debts to six credit card companies. At the 
time of the filing of her answer to the SOR she showed evidence from 2001 and 2003 of payment or settlement of three of the debts totaling almost $10,000.00. 
(1d,e, and f) Subsequent to receipt of the FORM, Applicant submitted documentation as to the remaining three debts to show that in March 2003, she had 
settled one account for 80% of the debt (1a), in early April 2004, had paid a second account in full (1b) and was paying $200.00 a month on a third account that 
was deemed current by the creditor (1c). (Attachment 1 to Supplemental Answer)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Initially, the government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's extensive delinquent debts prompted the allegation in the SOR of violation of Guideline F in that an individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a 
history of not meeting financial obligations (E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence of inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) Mitigating Conditions 
(MC) include the fact that the person has initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. (E2.A6.1.3.6.)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has shown through documentary evidence from her creditors that the debts have either been paid, settled, or deemed current by her creditors. I 
therefore conclude that the allegations have been mitigated. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>After considering all the evidence as a whole, and focusing on the whole person of the Applicant, I conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant a security clearance to the Applicant. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline F:  For APPLICANT</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.a.:   For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:   For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.c.:   For Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.d.:   For Applicant </P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.e.:   For Applicant </P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.f.:   For Applicant</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>After full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.</P>
