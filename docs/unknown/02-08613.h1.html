<P>Applicant's past  drug use, personal conduct, and criminal conduct raise security concerns as he knowingly and willfully omitted adverse information from his 
security forms in 1996 and 1997 about his illegal drug use that continued from 1994 until at least October 2003 even though he understood marijuana use was 
against the government's security policies.  He knowingly used illegal drugs after being granted a security clearance and has no stated intent to stop using 
marijuana.  Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on September 15, 2003.  The SOR detailed 
reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-08613.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over drug use (Guideline H), personal conduct (Guideline E), and criminal conduct (Guideline J). 
Applicant received the SOR on October 1, 2003, and responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on October 13, 2003, where he admitted all of 
the allegations and requested a decision without a hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on December 4, 2003, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and advised Applicant that the had 30 
days from receipt of the letter to respond.  Applicant received the FORM on December 10, 2003, but failed to provide any response within the thirty day 
deadline.  On February 20, 2004, the case was assigned to me. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, 48 years old, has worked for defense contractor #1 since 1995.  From 1992 to 1995 he was self-employed.  From 1982 to 1992 he worked for 
defense contractor #2. (Exhibits 4, 7, 8) Applicant initially completed a security form (SF 86) in May 1996 (Exhibit 7) and again in January 1997 (Exhibit 8).  
Applicant was granted a Defense Department Top Secret security clearance in April 1997.  (Exhibit 4)</P> 
<P>Applicant attended a university from 1986 to present but received no degree.  (Exhibits 4, 8)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use, Personal Conduct</STRONG>, <STRONG>Criminal Conduct, </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In January 1997 Applicant was given a Personnel Security Policy Advisory that improper use of drugs by National Security Agency (NSA) affiliates was strictly 
prohibited; in fact, he signed a "Drug Statement" that advised him that "unlawful use of any narcotic substance, marijuana, or dangerous drugs, is a basis for 
ineligibility for Special Security Access."  He was further advised that "any future unlawful use of any narcotic substance, marijuana, or dangerous drugs may 
result in removal of Special Security Access."  (Exhibit 8) </P> 
<P>In a November 1997 letter Applicant appealed an October 1997 NSA decision to deny him a security clearance wherein he admitted falsifying security forms; 
he admitted previous drug use as a young man, and in 1994 when he tried marijuana again.  He stated his intent to continue his marijuana use on weekends.  
(Exhibit 6)  In September 1998 NSA<A HREF="02-08613.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> advised Appellant's company that he was denied NSA SCI access in October 1997 and that he had completed the appeal 
rights afforded him.  (Exhibit 9)</P> 
<P>Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in February 2002.  He stated that he had falsified his security questionnaire in May 1996 
because he "did not think it would be possible to get a security clearance" if he told the truth about his use of marijuana.  From 1971 to 1976 he used hashish 
about 100 times; he used LSD 100 times, and marijuana on a daily basis two or three times a day.  After having stopped his illegal drug use in 1976 and after18 
year where he had remained drug free, he began in 1994 to use marijuana again after some friends teased him.  He continued to use marijuana even when he lost 
his security clearance in1997.  His friends usually gave him the marijuana.  Since 2000 he has been using marijuana twice weekly and admitted his use 
continued to February 2002 when he was interviewed by DSS.  He admitted that one effect of his past drug use was short term memory loss.  Applicant never 
sought counseling because of his marijuana use.  While he stated he "could quit," his intent was to continue using marijuana unless his circumstances changed.  
(Exhibit 5)  </P> 
<P>Applicant completed another SF 86 in June 2003 where he admitted cannabis use from June 1996 to present and admitted use while he had a security clearance.  
(Exhibit 4)  He admitted to his continuing drug use in October 2003, but stated he had never gone to work under the influence of drugs.  (Answer)</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[First]  Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or 
cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[Second] Inhalants and other similar substances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. Any drug abuse<A HREF="02-08613.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> (see above definition); </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[First]  Refusal to undergo or cooperate with required security processing, including medical and psychological testing; or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">[Second] Refusal to complete required security forms, releases, or provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials 
or other official representatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline  J</STRONG> <STRONG>- Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.  Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant then needs to present evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order to 
overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
clearance.  Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may 
be made only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Use</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established security concerns over Applicant's intermittent marijuana use  from 1971 to 1976 and again from 1994 to at least October 2003.  
He continued to use marijuana continuously even after he had applied for a security clearance.  His marijuana use continued even after he was advised such 
drug use was inconsistent with being granted access to classified information and after he was denied access by NSA.  Further, he continued to use marijuana 
even after he had been granted a top secret clearance in April 1997.  Subsequently, Applicant has made no commitment to stop his marijuana use and to avoid 
future drug use.  He has continued to use marijuana despite these government policies and laws against drug use. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given the passage of time since his early drug use, Applicant mitigated this  past drug from 1971 to 1976.  On the other hand, for Applicant began to use drugs 
again in 1996 knowing that it was against the government's policies and continues with no expressed intent to quit.  This conduct raises ample questions about 
his judgment overall.  Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Section 986(c)(2) and the Deputy Secretary of Defense implementing memorandum of June 2001, continuous use 
of an unlawful controlled substance requires a denial of a security clearance. Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, while I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c., I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e., 1.f., 1.g. and 1.h. incorporated 
under SOR Paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government clearly established security concerns over Applicant's personal conduct.  Applicant had a duty to disclose his past drug use on security forms 
in 1996 and in 1997, and he failed to disclose this adverse information.  Applicant's behavior reflects questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not properly safeguard classified information. Thus, he has shown poor 
judgment in his personal conduct by his knowing and willful failure to disclose required information on his drug use on two government forms as he had a duty 
to disclose fully  all his drug use.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> To rebut and overcome the Government's case, Applicant would have to demonstrate that he has mitigated<A HREF="02-08613.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> this conduct.  He provided no evidence of 
mitigation, such as a good work record. Nor did he provide any favorable reference letters.   To his credit he later disclosed his drug use to a DSS agent in 2002 
and in his June 2003 SF 86.  However, this later disclosure cannot erase security concerns over his earlier omissions where he failed to give truthful answers to 
questions that were both relevant and material to his security eligibility.  Security concerns persist over his conduct in the security clearance process which also 
led NSA to deny him access in 1998.  Hence, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on 
subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c. under SOR Paragraph 2</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established security concerns over Applicant's criminal conduct under Title 18 United States Code Section 1001<A HREF="02-08613.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> as he falsified answers to 
questions on two federal security form by failing to disclose the details of the recency and frequency of his marijuana use.  Although he was never prosecuted 
under this statute or convicted, his conduct, as discussed above under personal conduct, falls within that statute as his false answers to the drug question were 
given "knowingly and willfully."  While he disclosed his drug use in 2002 and again in 2003, he also had a duty to fully disclose his drug use on the earlier 
government forms.  His knowing failure to make these required disclosures raises continuing concerns about his security worthiness  under Title 18 United 
States Code Section 1001.  Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 
3.a. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 3. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
