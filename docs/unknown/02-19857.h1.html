<P>Although Applicant was sentenced to19 months imprisonment in 1992, he served only 60 days in jail. Consequently, 18 U.S.C. &sect;986, as amended, does not

Clearance granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 13 May 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of criminal conduct.<A HREF="02-19857.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant answered the SOR on 1 June 2004 requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 10 August 2004 
and I convened a hearing on 7 September 2005. DOHA received the transcript on 16 September 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 14 December 2004, this case became subject to a moratorium on all cases involving application of 18 U.S.C. 986 pending receipt of implementing guidance 
for statutory changes made in October 2004. The moratorium was lifted on 3 August 2005, and I later scheduled the case for hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 2004, 18 U.S.C. &sect;986 was amended to provide, in pertinent part, that the statute would apply only in cases in which an applicant was sentenced to 
prison for more than a year and  served more than a year in prison. Previously, the statute applied in cases in which an applicant was sentenced to prison for 
more than a year, regardless of time served.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, the evidence demonstrated that while Applicant had been sentenced to more than a year in prison, he had served only 60 days in jail. Department 
Counsel observed (Tr. 74) that the factual predicate for application of the amended 18 U.S.C. &sect;986 had not been met, and I concur. Consequently, I enter a 
finding for Applicant on 1.b. as a matter of law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR; accordingly, Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 33-year-old analyst for a defense contractor since July 1998--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously had a clearance, but 
did have an interim clearance with this employer until sometime after the SOR was issued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant had six encounters with police between April 1990 and October 2000. Five of those encounters occurred between April 1990 and August 1992, when 
Applicant was 18-20 years old. The sixth was an October 2000 DWI.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's offenses ran the gamut from underage possession of alcohol and misrepresenting his age to breaking and entering, theft, and the DWI. The 
disposition of charges ranged from outright dismissal to fines and community service to jail time. In general, the disposition of charges was consistent with 
Applicant's description of the incidents.<A HREF="02-19857.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributed his early-1990s incidents to his immaturity and hanging out with the wrong kind of friends, especially a new friend who persuaded him 
help with the breaking and entering and theft from a audio store (1.e.). He admits his October 2000 DWI was just plain poor judgment. He had gone to a party 
at a friend's house intending to spend the night and not drive home. However, when the friend lost power and ran out of food, Applicant changed his plans and 
attempted to drive home. He was stopped and arrested with a .14 B.A.C.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The little bit of time Applicant spent in jail as a result of the 1991 breaking and entering and theft charges was sobering time for him. He realized how much he 
had let down his family and other friends. He stopped associating with the friends he had gotten in trouble with in the early 1990s. He focused on getting his 
college degree, sometimes working three jobs to meet those expenses. He obtained sole custody of his two-year old daughter in December 1998. He had no 
criminal incidents between August 1992 and October 2000, when he had the DWI. After the DWI, but before his court appearance, he attended an alcohol 
education course. He was evaluated as a social drinker, but he also realized the risks he had undertaken by drinking and driving. He no longer drinks and drives.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's supervisor noted his excellent work ethic and his security consciousness during the time he had an interim clearance. His father described the 
changes in Applicant's behavior after his legal problems in the early 1990s. Applicant serves in two outside fiduciary positions: He is the cookie manager for 
his daughter's Girl Scout troop and he serves as treasurer for a football league he plays in.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="02-19857.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

age 21 (1.a., 1.b.). In March 1991, he received a $35-net fine for minor misrepresenting age (1.c.). In August 1991, he was given probation before judgment and fined $20.00 for minor 
misrepresenting age (1.d.). In September 1991, he received 19 months imprisonment, $1,000.00 in fines, $100 restitution, and three-years probation for breaking and entering and theft under 
$300.00. Sixteen of the 19 months were suspended and Applicant served 60 days in jail with time off for good behavior (1.e.). In August 1992, a charge of alcohol possession under age 21 was 
dismissed when the judge accepted Applicant's testimony that the beer in the vehicle he was riding in was not his and he had not been drinking (1.f.). Applicant's October 2000 DWI resulted in
