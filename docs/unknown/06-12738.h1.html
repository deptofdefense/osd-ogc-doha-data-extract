<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Fifty-six-year-old Applicant had five alleged debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR). </SPAN> Her debt problems resulted from her husband's unemployment, and underemployment.  She disputed 
three SOR debts, asserting they were solely her husband's responsibility. Two SOR debts were paid.  Two of the three disputed SOR debts were beyond the 3-year South Carolina statute of

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) does not cite or refer to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, but it 
does cite DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy 
Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the 
Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case, the pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the same.  
The Regulation, paragraph C8.2.1 provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor personnel. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 18, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On August 31, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to her, pursuant to the Directive and the Regulation.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR 
detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, received at DOHA on September 30, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 2006, the case 
was assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 30, 2006.  At her hearing I approved Applicant's request that I hold the record open so she could submit additional documentary evidence 
(R. 44-46, 60).  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on December 13, 2006, and I received it on December 14, 2006.  Department Counsel had no objection and I admitted the additional 
evidence (Exhibits F-I) she provided  on December 8, 2006, and January 3, 8, and 12, 2007. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she and/or her husband were responsible for the five debts listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Her admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 56-years-old.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  For the last twelve years, she has been employed by a United States government contractor and is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  In addition to 
her  work for a government contractor, she has a part-time job caring for a handicapped adult (R. 24).  She previously worked for a dentist for 12 years, and for a hospital for 14 years (R. 47).  She 
has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has completed several courses at a technical school.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  </SPAN>Applicant was married on October 28, 1972, and has three children (born in 1980, 1985 and 1987) (R. 22; 
Exhibit 7 at 8).  Her three children are all attending college (R. 22).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's husband was making $60,000 to $70,000 per year and she was making $14,000 per year working for a defense contractor before he lost his high-paying job in February 2000.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He 
subsequently went from job to job working at various car dealerships.  He attempted to start his own business.  A year or so later, he found a job, which paid about $20,000 per year (R. 23).  They 
could not pay their mortgage, and their home went into foreclosure (R. 23).  They have been separated for over four years (R. 23).  Their daughter had medical problems and an eating disorder (R. 
23).  Prior to her divorce, Applicant's husband physically assaulted her (R. 23).  When she was living with her husband, he took care of the financial responsibilities, and paid the family's debts (R. 
32, 48).  After their relationship deteriorated, she was unable to communicate with him about financial matters (R. 48). </P> 
 
<P>On May 3, 2006, Applicant's divorce was final (Exhibit 7 at 13).  In regard to marital debts, the divorce decree did not list any, but it did specify, "each party shall return to the other all credit cards 
on accounts for which the other is the sole holder, and shall make no further charges thereon.  The parties represent and affirm that they have made no additional charges to the accounts of the other.  
In the event such charges have been made, the party making them shall pay the other the amount of said charges" (Exhibit 7 at 17).  The divorce decree does not allocate any of the couple's debts, 
and even if it did, the creditor must receive notice of the divorce litigation, which provides an opportunity for the creditor to contest the release or allocation of financial responsibilities.   <EM>See</EM> S.C. 
Code. Ann. &sect; 20-7-477.     </P> 
 
<P>About three years ago, Applicant and her husband considered filing for bankruptcy.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  They paid a fee to an attorney.  Her husband had approximately $270,000 in debt.  She was unable to learn 
whether her husband still intended to file for bankruptcy because of their divorce (R. 35).  Although he did not list the particular debts, he generally admitted responsibility for many debts (R. 36; 
Exhibit C at 19-20).   </P> 
 
<P>The debt in SOR &para; 1.a ($6,487) was for a charge card that was charged off in February 2004.  A 2004 credit bureau report (CBR) indicates the account was opened in November 2003; the credit 
limit was $6,225; the amount owed is $6,487; the last activity on the account was in February 2004; and Applicant is an authorized user (Exhibit 3 at 3).  According to the creditor, Applicant's 
former husband is on the account, and she is not (R. 25-27).  The creditor decided that she could not obtain account information because the she is not on the account (R. 26-28; Exhibt A at 22; 
Exhibit B at 13). </P> 
 
<P>The SOR &para; 1.b ($838) debt is for car repair or parts, and it was charged off in May 2000.  Applicant's former husband is on the account, and she is not (R. 29-31).  A bill from the SOR &para; 1.b 
creditor, dated December 25, 2002, is addressed to Applicant's husband, not to Applicant (Exhibit A at 23).  A creditor representative told Applicant she was not responsible for this debt, and she 
sent a letter to the creditor documenting her lack of responsibility (Exhibit F at 3, 9).</P> 
 
<P>The SOR &para; 1.c ($621) debt is for a department store account that was charged off in May 2002.  She accepted responsibility for this debt (R. 31-32; Exhibit B at 20-21).  The creditor agreed to 
accept $310 as payment to settle the debt (R. 31; Exhibit A at 30-32; Exhibit B at 21-22).  She paid the creditor's settlement amount.  <EM>Id</EM>.  She did not pay the debt earlier because she was focused on 
paying her family's medical debts (R. 33). </P> 
 
<P>The debt in SOR &para; 1.d ($12,985) for a credit card was charged off in May 2002.  A 2004 credit bureau report (CBR) indicates the account was opened in May 1978; the credit limit was $12,985; the 
amount owed is $12,985; the last activity on the account was in May 2002; and Applicant is the individual account holder (Exhibit 3 at 4).  Applicant had an account with the same bank and her 
account was paid off (R. 34).  She had no access to the account in SOR &para; 1.d, and had no knowledge of signing any credit applications as a joint user (R. 34).  An undated letter from the SOR &para; 1.d 
creditor offered to issue a credit card to Applicant's spouse, and indicated one credit card was issued (Exhibit C at 10).  On December 5, 2006, she wrote the SOR &para; 1.d creditor denying 
responsibility for this account, asking for proof, if any, that she was responsible for this account (Exhibit C at 15-17; Exhibit F at 6).  She asked the SOR &para; 1.d creditor to contact credit report 
bureaus and inform them that she was not responsible for that delinquent debt. <EM> Id</EM>.  On January 12, 2007, she provided a letter from the SOR &para; 1.d creditor stating the creditor agreed that the debt 
should be removed from her credit reports and promising to so notify the three largest credit bureau reporting companies (Exhibit I).   </P> 
 
<P>The SOR &para; 1.e ($104,000) debt pertains to a home-mortgage account.  Applicant and her husband purchased their residence in 1993 (R. 37).   Her husband refinanced their loan in 2000 ( R. 37).  It 
went into foreclosure in 2001 (R. 37, 40).  At the hearing, she said she was not aware of the sale price at the foreclosure sale (R. 38, 42-43).  She subsequently learned her residence was sold on 
January 14, 2003, and the sale price was $121,670 (Exhibit F at 5).  She sent a letter to the creditor asking the creditor to contact credit report bureaus (CBR) and inform the CBRs that there was no 
delinquent debt (Exhibit F at 4).  On December 13, 2006, the creditor responded asking Applicant for more account information (Exhibit G at 4).  On December 20, 2006, she provided all the 
information she had regarding this mortgage account (Exhibit G at 2).   </P> 
 
<P>Her income per year is $20,000 (R. 38-39).  Except for the five debts listed on the SOR she is current on all of her bills (R. 41).  She was unsure about her legal responsibilities on the five SOR 
debts as opposed to her husband's responsibilities ( R. 40-41). </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) at her hearing.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Her net salary for both jobs totaled $1,585 per month, and her expenses totaled $906 per month.  She listed monthly 
household expenses as follows:  rent ($600), groceries ($0), clothing ($0), utilities ($177), car expenses ($0), and miscellaneous ($0).  She provided the following debts:  four credit cards with total 
monthly payments of $129.  After deducting all expenses and debt payments, she had a positive cash flow of $679 per month.  Her PFS did not list assets or the amounts owed on her credit cards.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">She provided evidence of payment of other, non-SOR debts,<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN> and evidence of how she obtained the extra money to pay these debts (Exhibit D at 9).  She maintains a budget, and her payments are 
timely.   </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant's fianc&eacute; was formerly her supervisor at the government contractor.  He described her as trustworthy, truthful, diligent, and in the top ten percent of the contractor's employees (R. 49-54).  
He is aware of her current financial circumstances, and confirmed that she is current on her bills (R. 51).  He said if she discovered that she owed $20,000 on her foreclosed house, and $12,000 on 
the bank card, he would support her financially stating, "I would go through anything for this woman" (R. 53).  His salary is $45,000 per year, and he has an Air Force retirement of about $15,000 
per year (R. 53).  About $2,000 per month remains after he pays his expenses and debts (R. 53). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative </SPAN>judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its 
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the 
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The debt in SOR &para; 1.c for $621was charged off in May 2002, and she did not settle and pay the creditor until November 23, 
2006.  This  debt was delinquent for at least four years.  Applicant established that the debt in SOR &para; 1.e was paid through a foreclosure sale.  It too was delinquent for a substantial period of time.  
Applicant has established that the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.b are her husband's debts, or at least she has provided sufficient evidence to dispute her responsibility for these two debts.  The  creditor 
for the largest, disputed SOR debt (&para; 1.d) agreed that it should be removed from her credit reports on December 31, 2006.   She currently has no legally enforceable, delinquent debts. The credit 
reports are insufficient evidence to establish her responsibility in light of her sincere and convincing testimony that she was not responsible for these two debts.         </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failure to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.c and 1.e, which then became delinquent and remained 
delinquent for several years. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating 
condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-12738.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> I conclude FC 
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple delinquent SOR debts.  Payment of the debt in SOR &para; 1.c on November 23, 2006, is simply too recent to merit application of FC MC 1. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to the two debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.c and 1.e at issue because the debts became delinquent several years ago, and these delinquent debts were the result of her separation from 
her husband, his unemployment, and underemployment as well as his failure to provide adequate financial support to Applicant.  Her financial situation was aggravated by her daughter's medical 
bills.  This change in family circumstances is a good example of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3, causing financial problems that may be "largely beyond the person's 
control."  I conclude that Applicant's statement about how her debts became delinquent is credible and sufficient to provide some credit under FC MC 3 in regard to her debts.  Applicant, however, 
does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she waited until November 23, 2006, to pay the debt in SOR &para; 1.c.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how she endeavored to pay or resolve 
the debt in SOR &para; 1.c for several years.  However, her recent resolution of the remaining SOR debt, keeping her payments current, and demonstration of payment of other non-SOR debts warrants 
some credit, which will be applied in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>.  Based on the sincerity of her testimony, and the other record indicia of improved financial self-discipline, I am confident that 
she is on the right track now towards maintenance of her finances.  </P> 
 
<P>She did not receive financial counseling, but receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there are clear indications (since November 23, 2006) that the problem is resolved and under control.  In

132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is currently 
56 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 
<SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her inability to repay her debts resulted from her husband's unemployment, underemployment, and her separation 
from her husband.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the complete absence of new delinquent debt 
over the last three years.  Moreover, potential increased income though her marriage shows signs of financial improvement in the future. </SPAN>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress 
is low.  Applicant is current on her recent debts, as her loans and credit cards are current. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> She has gradually eliminated her delinquent debts.  Greater awareness of financial responsibilities will 
result in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances. Moreover, stability in her employment, increases in her income, and reduction in her debt load show improved self-discipline, 
and greater consciousness of her financial responsibilities.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 04-07360 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006), the Board noted that two SOR debts were paid through judgment and garnishment, one SOR debt was paid through settlement, and one SOR 
debt was never paid.  Indeed for one SOR debt, the applicant did not even contact the creditor about payment.  Nevertheless, the applicant showed that he reduced his overall debt by 95% and the 
Board affirmed the decision to grant that applicant a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial case is similar to ISCR Case No. 04-07360.  One large SOR debt was paid through a foreclosure sale in 2003.  One SOR debt was paid on November 23, 2006.  One large SOR 
debt was successfully disputed.  Two SOR debts remain under dispute, as her husband has the responsibility to pay these debts.  One of her husband's unpaid SOR debts are barred by South 
Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations.  As such, the concern about current financial pressure that may result in illegal activity is significantly lower because as a matter of law, she no longer has 
any delinquent debts.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has </SPAN>mitigated the 
trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.</P>
