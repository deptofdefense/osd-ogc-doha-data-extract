<P>Applicant is 40 years old.  He is married.  His family members are citizens of Vietnam and </P> 
 
<P>reside there, except for his one brother who lives in the United States but is a citizen of Vietnam.  His wife is a citizen of Vietnam and lives in the United States 
as a registered alien.  Applicant became a United States citizen in 1994.  Applicant did not present any evidence to mitigate the grave concerns about foreign 
influence under Guideline B.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG>  </P> 
 
<P>On March 12, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, 
dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine 
whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a signed and sworn Answer, dated May 2, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations.  He requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu 
of a hearing.  On July 9, 2003, Applicant was given a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-05827.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>.  He was given the opportunity to file objections 
and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Nothing in the record indicates Applicant filed a response to the FORM by the August 30, 2003, 
due date.  This case was assigned to me on September 25, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted to the allegations in the SOR.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete review of the record evidence, 
I make additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 40 years old.  He is married and has two children.  His wife is a citizen of Vietnam, but is a registered alien living in the United States with 
Applicant and their children. (Exhibit 5 at 1, 4-6)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant works for a defense contractor.  He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1994.  There is no evidence showing when or how he came to the 
United States. (Exhibit 5 at 3 and 4)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has a mother and stepfather in Vietnam, and they are citizens of Vietnam.  Applicant has two sisters who are citizens of Vietnam also living there.  
His one brother is a citizen of Vietnam, and lives in the United States. (Answer; Exhibit 5 at 3 and 4)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Vietnam is a communist governed country with a poor record of respect for human rights and democratic institutions.  Free elections are not conducted, and all 
candidates belong to one party.  The United States has diplomatic relations with Vietnam. (Items 6 and 7)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Id</EM>. at 527.  The president has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgement, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing he use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Access to Classified Information </EM>Section 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicted upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be 
carefully considered according to the pertinent Guideline in making the overall common sense determination required. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, &para; E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2). Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an 
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, 
irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  See </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  
Once the Government has established a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  See Directive Para E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive Para. E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; see Exec. Or. 12968 Section 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B: Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(1) An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country.  Directive &para; E2.A2.l.2.l. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">None</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has relatives by birth and marriage in Vietnam.  He has his mother and stepfather living in Vietnam, and are citizens of Vietnam.  His two sisters live 
in Vietnam, and they are citizens of Vietnam.  His brother lives in the United States, but is a citizen of Vietnam.  He visited Vietnam for a total of ten months 
between 1995 and 1998.  There is no evidence Applicant has traveled there since 1998.  He is in telephone contact with his relatives in Vietnam every one or 
two weeks.  Disqualifying Condition (DC)1 applies.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">There are no Mitigating Conditions (MC) applicable here.  Applicant did not submit a statement or any statements from relative, friends, employers, or co-workers.  There is no evidence to demonstrate he has mitigated the DC.  With the frequency of contact with his relatives in Vietnam, it would be difficult to 
overcome the presumption that he has a close and frequent connection with his relatives in Vietnam.  For these reasons, there are no MC applicable in this case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Formal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby rendered as follows:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Paragraph 1 Guideline B: Against the Applicant</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
