<P>Applicant accrued approximately $10,700.00 in delinquent debts from 1988 through at least 2002 due in large part to a long period of unemployment after a 
workplace injury and irregular workmen's compensation payments. In 1999, all but $3,994.00 of her debts were discharged through bankruptcy. While 
Applicant's current financial management practices are less than ideal, she once again has steady income, is living within her means, and her remaining debts 
are not so onerous as to be of security significance. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 28, 2003 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts in Applicant's background 
which raise security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the 
Government, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On April 9, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on May 16, 2003. On June 2, 2003, DOHA 
issued a Notice of Hearing setting this case to be heard on June 18, 2003. All parties appeared as scheduled and the government presented six exhibits (GE 1 
through 6). Applicant relied on five exhibits (AE A through E), on her own testimony and on that of one other witness. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on 
June 25, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 60-years-old.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> She worked at a bakery for over 20 years and retired in 1988. Around the time of her retirement, she also experienced a debilitating 
injury to her wrists requiring corrective surgery. This entitled her to monthly workmen's compensation payments of about $1,300.00 in addition to her monthly 
retirement income of $343.00. Before leaving the bakery, Applicant earned about $2,180.00 gross each month. Applicant currently earns about $2,000.00 gross 
pay each month plus her retirement pay.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was unemployed due to her injury from May 1988 until September 1994, when she obtained work with a contractor that specialized in hiring persons 
with physical problems. This contractor assigned Applicant to work at a DoD facility doing custodial and low-level administrative jobs. She performed her 
duties extremely well and earned the praise of her superiors, but was removed from that site pending the outcome of her security clearance adjudication.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After leaving the bakery in 1988, Applicant had trouble paying several credit card accounts she had opened while still employed. Her difficulty stemmed from 
her overall reduction in pay and from the irregular payment of her workman's compensation benefits. Applicant would send money to her creditors when she 
could, but decided in 1998 to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In March 1999, she was discharged of $6,941.00 in delinquent debts.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR attributes to Applicant $6,510.00 in delinquent debt. However, two debts totaling $2,516.00 alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.e were discharged in 
the aforementioned bankruptcy action. Further, the record does not support Applicant's claim the debts listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d were also 
discharged in bankruptcy. Therefore, she still owes the remaining $3,994.00 in delinquent debts listed in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant supports herself, her adult daughter and a minor grandchild They moved in with Applicant when the daughter's marriage broke up and she was 
enduring medical problems.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant receives no monetary contribution from her daughter for household expenses. Applicant's daughter and grandchild 
expect to move out, but Applicant does not know when this will happen.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The delinquent debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f is a mobile phone account Applicant set-up for her daughter. Applicant's daughter should repay the 
account, but Applicant accepts that the account is ultimately her responsibility. This account remains unpaid.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In January 2003, Applicant made her first payment of $286.00 to the creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.c under a "check-by-phone" repayment plan. After 
being interviewed during her background investigation in July 2001, Applicant was surprised to learn this debt was active. She thought she had paid the debt 
several years ago, but looked into the matter after the interview.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant appears to lack a sophisticated understanding of personal finances, but lives well within her modest means nonetheless. She has rented the same 
house for 22 years and what little money she has left over each month goes to her church. She has no credit cards or ongoing loan obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline F  (Financial Considerations) is the relevant adjudicative 
guideline to be applied here.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in 
ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
Government.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations). </STRONG> A security concern arises when it is shown that a person is either unwilling or unable to manage his finances so that 
he avoids unreasonable delinquencies. A person who is overextended financially is at risk of engaging in illegal actions to obtain money.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Here, the 
Government has shown that Applicant accumulated approximately $10,700.00<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> in bad debt between 1988 and 2002. Applicant still owes about $4,000.00 
having discharged the remainder through bankruptcy in 1999. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 3<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply. By contrast, Applicant's debt problems 
were initially caused 15 years ago by a job-related injury and subsequent reduced and irregular income. Despite attempts to make headway in paying her debts, 
she continued to fall behind and eventually made the prudent decision to file for bankruptcy protection. This reduced her delinquent debt obligations 
significantly but did not eradicate the problem. Her remaining delinquencies amount to less than $4,000.00 and she has entered into a repayment plan for a debt 
she thought had been previously paid (subparagraph 1.c). Given her modest but steady income, this is a significant step in the right direction. I conclude the 
facts here support application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 1,<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN> MC 3,<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN> and MC 6.<A HREF="01-24129.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN> On balance, I conclude that Applicant's remaining debt is not of such 
security significance that she should be disqualified from holding a clearance. This is especially true in light of the fact she has not continued to generate new 
debts and her inability to pay her old debts was not entirely her own doing.</P> 
 
<P>I have carefully weighed all of the evidence in this case, and I have applied the aforementioned disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each 
applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3.</P>
