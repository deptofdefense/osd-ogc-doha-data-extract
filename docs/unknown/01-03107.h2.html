<P>On April 25, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
denied or revoked. </P> 
<P>On June 20, 2001, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge based on 
the written record; i.e., without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) to Applicant on August 7, 2001.  
The FORM includes 7 exhibits, which have been marked and admitted as Government Exhibits (GX) 1 - 7.  The Applicant was instructed to submit 
information in response to the FORM within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Through counsel, Applicant submitted  a timely response to the FORM, dated 
September 12, 2001.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on February 11, 2002.  I issued a Decision on February 15, 2002, in which I found it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant.  The Government appealed the decision and, on August 27, 
2002, the DOHA Appeal Board issued an Appeal Board Decision and Remand Order.  The case file was returned to me on September 5, 2002, with directions 
to issue a new decision after correcting the errors identified in the Decision and Remand Order, consistent with my obligations under Directive, Additional  
Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.35. And E3.1.25.</P> 
<P>As I understand the Appeal Board Decision and Remand Order, I erred by failing to articulate a rational basis for my conclusion as to Guideline E.  I have now 
considered and evaluated Applicant's conduct under Guideline E, and reached conclusions as to how Applicant's conduct should be viewed under that 
Guideline. </P> 
<P>In reaching the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions, I have specifically sought to comply with the Board's directions in correcting the errors cited in its 
Decision and Remand Order.  The Board has directed me to make an independent evaluation of the facts of this case under Guideline E and then to render a 
final decision in this case based on that independent evaluation. </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old security officer for a defense contractor that is seeking a security clearance for Applicant (level not specified in the FORM materials).  
The SOR contains four allegations (SOR 1.a - 1.d.) of misuse of information technology systems under Guideline M (not a factor in this remand) and one 
allegation (SOR 2.a.) of personal misconduct under Guideline E.  Because SOR 2.a. specifically references the four allegations under Guideline M, cited above, 
the discussion and findings of fact as to SOR 1.a - 1.d. are also relevant and material in determining how the evidence should be viewed under Guideline E </P> 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence in the case file, including Applicant's responses to the SOR and the FORM, I make the following FINDINGS OF 
FACT as to SOR 2.a. under Guideline E (Personal Conduct):</P> 
<P>Guideline E (Personal Conduct) </P> 
<P>2.a. Applicant's computer-related conduct at work included that cited in allegations 1.a - 1.d.</P> 
<P>of the SOR, as discussed below.   </P> 
<P>Applicant was reprimanded/counseled/spoken to by a work supervisor sometime in March or April 2000, for misusing his company computer by using it during 
work hours for other than official business, to wit: accessing adult chat rooms and other web sites during his work shift.  For reasons discussed below, I find the 
Government has not established that Applicant was reprimanded for accessing "pornographic" web sites (See Applicant's Response to SOR and Response to 
FORM, and memoranda attached thereto).</P> 
<P>Pornography is a generic term, with no precise legal definition.  The closest legal term is "obscenity", which, after many years of imprecise guidance, was 
finally defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in <EM>Miller v. California </EM>(383 U.S. 413 (1973)), laying out a three-part definition of obscenity, none of which have 
been established in the present case.  Nothing in the FORM establishes that the web sites visited by Applicant contained pornographic or obscene material as 
those terms are defined under Federal law, regulation, or judicial or DOHA precedent.  In this regard, I note that Applicant's conduct is not alleged under 
Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) or Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  In any case, it is not the pornographic or nonpornographic nature of the web sites accessed 
by Applicant that is the focus of the Guideline M allegations,  but that Applicant was spoken to by his superiors because of the cited excessive computer use. </P> 
<P>In December 1999, Applicant was "verbally counseled" by a second supervisor, Mr. W,  for misusing company computers during working hours.  Again, the 
record does not establish that all or some of the web sites referenced were in fact legally "pornographic."</P> 
<P>From December 1997 to at least June 13, 2000, Applicant visited "adult" and other  web sites during working hours at least twice a week.  Many of the adult 
sites involved role playing in bondage situations.</P> 
<P>Applicant continued his personal use of company computers during working hours after being spoken to/counseled as cited in 1.a and 1.b., above.  However, he 
ended such use when he was promoted, which was prior to the issuance of specific written company policy on August 29, 2000.</P> 
<P>I also find as follows:</P> 
<P>In Applicant's Monthly Performance Review Form signed by his supervisor on January 13, 2000 (Applicant's Response to SOR, Attachment 2), Applicant 
received generally "Excellent" ratings (eight out of ten), and a highly positive evaluation of his "Strong Points," and the following language under "Supervisor 
suggestion(s) for performance enhancement":</P> 
<P>It has been made known to me that [Applicant] may be spending too much time on the internet and not paying enough attention to the monitors on the console.  
We all, at times, log onto the net, but it is essential that the [alarm console officer, such as Applicant] pay close attention to  console activities.</P> 
<P>The supervisor referenced in SOR 1.a "counseled discretion" as to Applicant's visits to adult chat rooms "two or three times a week during work hours" in the 
Spring of 2000 (Response to SOR at p. 4).  Company policy memoranda (dated August 19, 1998, November 9, 1998, March 31, 1999, and August 9, 2000), are 
addressed to more than 20 employees (including Applicant) and do not mention "pornographic sites."  Neither do other memoranda on the same topic, from 
other company officials (Attachment 1 - 5 to GX 3, Applicant's Response to the SOR).  Applicant stressed that he accessed the web primarily during "slack 
periods" of the "swing" and "graveyard" shifts, or while on break during those periods and "did not access the Internet during the day shift" (Applicant's 
Response to SOR). </P> 
<P>The most definitive and documented policy statement having to do with restrictions on computer use is dated  August 29, 2000 (last page of Attachment 4 to 
Applicant's Response to SOR).  From the strong language, directed at all plant protection staff, including Applicant, the new policy prohibits all nonofficial 
business, regardless of whether it is games, downloading of music, or anything else, impliedly including adult or sexually-oriented web sites. </P> 
<P>I conclude from the above that while Applicant may have acted inappropriately in accessing adult web sites beginning in December 1997, he did not violate 
specific company rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations unless such conduct continued after August 29, 2000.  But, the supervisor referenced in the ROI 
admitted as GX 4 states that as far as he knew, Applicant had "discontinued his alleged misuse" and the "matter [was] closed."  In his Response to the SOR, 
Applicant sets the date of his last misuse of the company computer as "just prior to [his] promotion to supervisor on July 16, 2000" and more than six weeks 
before issuance of the August 29, 2000 memorandum establishing the policy prohibiting all nonofficial use.  The totality of the  record evidence indicates that 
Appellant stopped the practice prior to August 29,1997.</P> 
<P>In his response to the SOR, Applicant submitted Attachment 1, in which the company recognizes and explicitly approves "some incidental and insignificant 
personal use, . . . subject to management's discretion."  The only uses specifically cited as violating company policy do not pertain to Applicant's use.  
Attachment 3 is an August 19, 1998 memorandum to the plant staff (including, but not limited to Applicant), which sets aside a particular "Control Room PC" 
for "official use only," suggesting that other computers may be accessed for personal use, subject to management discretion, as is provided for in Attachment 1.  
Other memoranda refer to the use of specific PCs for official use only (Attachment 4 (November 9, 1998, and November 18, 1998), and computers other than 
that assigned to the individual in question (Attachment 4 (March 31, 1999).</P> 
<P>In January 2000, Applicant informed his supervisor that he had visited adult web sites while on duty (Response to FORM, at Paragraph 1, Attachment B at pp. 
2-3).  The supervisor counseled discretion but did not tell Applicant to stop accessing the web sites in question (<EM>Id</EM>., at Paragraph 1.a.).  Likewise, Applicant's 
line supervisor, in discussing a pending work evaluation, told Applicant that  he should not spend excessive time on the Internet (<EM>Id</EM>. at Para. 1.b.).  Both of 
these admonitions occurred some seven months before the August 29, 2000 memorandum (last page of Attachment 4 to Applicant's Response to SOR), in 
which the first written (and specific) company policy on computer use to access the Internet was issued.  Applicant's last use of company computers to access 
adult sites was in early July 2000, prior to his being promoted to supervisor on July 16, 2000.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, </P> 
<P>at Enclosure 2, sets forth policy factors that must be given "binding consideration" in making security clearance determinations.  The factors must be followed 
in every case, according to the pertinent criterion or criteria.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any specific case, 
nor can they supersede the exercise of an Administrative Judge's common sense and knowledge of relevant law and regulations. Because each security 
clearance case presents its own facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience or apply equally in every 
case.  Considering the evidence as a whole, and based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, I find the following specific adjudicative guideline to be most 
pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P>GUIDELINE E (Personal Conduct)  </P> 
<P><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
<P>Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.1. - Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances.  </P> 
<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
<P>E2.A51.2.1. - The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment,  trustworthiness, or reliability, </P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  In reaching the fair and 
impartial overall common sense determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to 
speculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, 
the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  </P> 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and 
material twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an applicant for a security 
clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  
These concerns include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard 
classified information.</P> 
<P>An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or 
information are denied or otherwise controverted by the Applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those controverted facts alleged in the 
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and establishes conduct that creates 
security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national 
security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. </P> 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by 
DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">    <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS </SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P>The bases for the SOR allegations, including specifically 2.a. are substantially statements made by Applicant.  In his June 13, 2000 sworn statement to a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) agent (GX 6), Applicant admitted the nature of his computer use. states:</P> 
<P>The Appeal Board has held that "misuse of a computer can be disqualifying under Guideline E even if there was no clear and precise policy against a particular 
type of computer misuse (ISCR Case No. 98-0265 (March17, 1999) at page 7, cited by Department Counsel in FORM).  Unlike the previous case, the present 
matter does not involve issues alleged under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior).  However, the term "pornographic" is clearly important to the Government's 
allegation under Guideline E, since it is mentioned directly or indirectly in all four SOR allegations on which the single Guideline E allegation is based.  </P> 
<P>For this reason, it has been necessary to determine whether Applicant's use of his company's computers can properly be construed as accessing pornographic 
web sites and material.  Considering all of the record information, I conclude the evidence of record does not show that some/most/all of the web sites were 
pornographic/obscene, nor did the Government attempt to do so.  Citing company documents attached to the Response to the SOR, Applicant contends 
Company A policy specifically allowed personal use of the company computers without restriction as to type of use. </P> 
<P>Applicant uses the term "pornographic" in his sworn statement to a Defense Security Service agent (GX 6).  As a general rule, an admission relieves the 
Government of having to independently prove the allegation.  In the present case, however, Applicant's admission that he accessed the Internet as cited in the 
SOR does not necessarily mean that he is correct that what he was viewing was "pornographic" by relevant legal standards. </P> 
<P>Overall, the record evidence demonstrates that Applicant's use of the company computers for personal activities: (1) was not unique to him; (2) was in fact 
known to his supervisors, who spoke with him about it but did not order him to stop; (3) did not prevent him from being promoted to supervisor in the Summer 
of 2000; (4) was stopped on his own volition because he recognized it was incompatible with his new responsibilities; and (5) was stopped prior to the issuance 
of specific company policy prohibiting any personal use.</P> 
<P>The core issue on remand is how the above information and facts, as discussed above, should be viewed under Guideline E. Even though this case does not 
involve any allegations made under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), such behavior is clearly relevant to any reasoned decision.  The facts of record in the 
present case do not come anywhere near the <EM>egregious</EM> end of the spectrum of adult or sexual-related activities, such as child pornography or violence against 
women.  The real issue is whether Applicants admitted misuse of the company computer raises a doubt about his ability and/or willingness to protect the 
nation's secrets.  I conclude that however tasteless and even questionable Applicant's conduct may have been to others, it does not rise to the level of making 
him a risk to national security. </P> 
<P>Viewing what he did under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 2 and DC 3 are inapplicable since there is no evidence of any falsifications or omissions and DC 6 
is inapplicable because there is no evidence of his association with persons involved in criminal activities.  </P> 
<P>DC 4 might have been applicable in that Applicant's conduct might have increased his vulnerability except that is now too far in the past and too widely known 
to constitute a risk.  DC 5 is not applicable since there is no pattern of dishonesty or rule violations alleged or suggested by the record, since the company rules 
and policies that could or would have covered Applicant's conduct were not issued until after the conduct stopped   </P> 
<P>DC 1 may be applicable in that there was "reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other 
acquaintances."  The information obtained from others at his company certainly qualifies as "unfavorable" but, as discussed above, it does not rise to the level 
of making him a risk to fail to protect classified information.  Clearly, Applicant's use of the company computers did not violate specific written policies, nor 
did it result in any punitive action by the company.  </P> 
<P>The people who know him best in the context of this matter are those at his company.  From what is in the record, as discussed above, his superiors counseled 
him but still thought highly enough of him to promote him, even after learning of his computer use.  Again, while Applicant was "cautioned" about his 
excessive use of the computer (FORM at page 5), he was not censured, reprimanded, fined, or otherwise disciplined.  In this context, I give considerable weight 
to his company's favorable action toward Applicant.  </P> 
<P>The real question is whether Applicant's conduct, as alleged in SOR 1.a. - 1.d., and incorporated by reference into SOR 2.a., constitutes the "questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that] could indicate [he] may not 
properly safeguard classified information" (Directive, Guideline E). </P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>I conclude that a case has not been made under Guideline E (SOR 2.a.) because cause the underlying facts in this case do not establish the questionable 
judgment, unreliability and/or untrustworthiness that would make him a risk to the proper safeguarding of classified information.  </P> 
<P>Of all the Mitigating Conditions, only MC 1 is applicable, in the sense that the negative information was legally unsubstantiated, or at least not shown by the 
Government to be substantiated.  If DC 4 is applicable, then MC 5 is also applicable and more persuasive, since his conduct is now more widely known and 
consequently less likely to result in any pressure being placed on him. </P> 
<P>Overall, considering his positive record at the company, his position and evaluations, I conclude the risk of recurrence is minimal.  In complying with the 
directions of the Appeal Board, I have considered the totality of the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and have assessed 
Applicant's credibility based on the written record.  I conclude that the evidence favorable to Applicant significantly outweighs the unfavorable evidence (ISCR 
Case No. 98-0265 (March 19, 1999) at page 3).  </P>

<P>On April 25, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make

<P>Applicant was reprimanded/counseled/spoken to by a work supervisor sometime in March or April 2000, for misusing his company computer by using it during 
work hours for other than official business, to wit: accessing adult chat rooms and other web sites during his work shift.  For reasons discussed below, I find the 
Government has not established that Applicant was reprimanded for accessing "pornographic" web sites (See Applicant's Response to SOR and Response to 
FORM, and memoranda attached thereto).</P> 
<P>Pornography is a generic term, with no precise legal definition.  The closest legal term is "obscenity", which, after many years of imprecise guidance, was 
finally defined by the U.S. Supreme Court in <EM>Miller v. California </EM>(383 U.S. 413 (1973)), laying out a three-part definition of obscenity, none of which have 
been established in the present case.  Nothing in the FORM establishes that the web sites visited by Applicant contained pornographic or obscene material as 
those terms are defined under Federal law, regulation, or judicial or DOHA precedent.  In this regard, I note that Applicant's conduct is not alleged under 
Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) or Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  In any case, it is not the pornographic or nonpornographic nature of the web sites accessed 
by Applicant that is the focus of the Guideline M allegations,  but that Applicant was spoken to by his superiors because of the cited excessive computer use. </P> 
<P>In December 1999, Applicant was "verbally counseled" by a second supervisor, Mr. W,  for misusing company computers during working hours.  Again, the 
record does not establish that all or some of the web sites referenced were in fact legally "pornographic."</P> 
<P>From December 1997 to at least June 13, 2000, Applicant visited "adult" and other  web sites during working hours at least twice a week.  Many of the adult 
sites involved role playing in bondage situations.</P> 
<P>Applicant continued his personal use of company computers during working hours after being spoken to/counseled as cited in 1.a and 1.b., above.  However, he 
ended such use when he was promoted, which was prior to the issuance of specific written company policy on August 29, 2000.</P> 
<P>I also find as follows:</P> 
<P>In Applicant's Monthly Performance Review Form signed by his supervisor on January 13, 2000 (Applicant's Response to SOR, Attachment 2), Applicant 
received generally "Excellent" ratings (eight out of ten), and a highly positive evaluation of his "Strong Points," and the following language under "Supervisor 
suggestion(s) for performance enhancement":</P> 
<P>It has been made known to me that [Applicant] may be spending too much time on the internet and not paying enough attention to the monitors on the console.  
We all, at times, log onto the net, but it is essential that the [alarm console officer, such as Applicant] pay close attention to  console activities.</P> 
<P>The supervisor referenced in SOR 1.a "counseled discretion" as to Applicant's visits to adult chat rooms "two or three times a week during work hours" in the 
Spring of 2000 (Response to SOR at p. 4).  Company policy memoranda (dated August 19, 1998, November 9, 1998, March 31, 1999, and August 9, 2000), are 
addressed to more than 20 employees (including Applicant) and do not mention "pornographic sites."  Neither do other memoranda on the same topic, from 
other company officials (Attachment 1 - 5 to GX 3, Applicant's Response to the SOR).  Applicant stressed that he accessed the web primarily during "slack 
periods" of the "swing" and "graveyard" shifts, or while on break during those periods and "did not access the Internet during the day shift" (Applicant's 
Response to SOR). </P> 
<P>The most definitive and documented policy statement having to do with restrictions on computer use is dated  August 29, 2000 (last page of Attachment 4 to 
Applicant's Response to SOR).  From the strong language, directed at all plant protection staff, including Applicant, the new policy prohibits all nonofficial 
business, regardless of whether it is games, downloading of music, or anything else, impliedly including adult or sexually-oriented web sites. </P> 
<P>I conclude from the above that while Applicant may have acted inappropriately in accessing adult web sites beginning in December 1997, he did not violate 
specific company rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations unless such conduct continued after August 29, 2000.  But, the supervisor referenced in the ROI 
admitted as GX 4 states that as far as he knew, Applicant had "discontinued his alleged misuse" and the "matter [was] closed."  In his Response to the SOR, 
Applicant sets the date of his last misuse of the company computer as "just prior to [his] promotion to supervisor on July 16, 2000" and more than six weeks 
before issuance of the August 29, 2000 memorandum establishing the policy prohibiting all nonofficial use.  The totality of the  record evidence indicates that 
Appellant stopped the practice prior to August 29,1997.</P> 
<P>In his response to the SOR, Applicant submitted Attachment 1, in which the company recognizes and explicitly approves "some incidental and insignificant 
personal use, . . . subject to management's discretion."  The only uses specifically cited as violating company policy do not pertain to Applicant's use.  
Attachment 3 is an August 19, 1998 memorandum to the plant staff (including, but not limited to Applicant), which sets aside a particular "Control Room PC" 
for "official use only," suggesting that other computers may be accessed for personal use, subject to management discretion, as is provided for in Attachment 1.  
Other memoranda refer to the use of specific PCs for official use only (Attachment 4 (November 9, 1998, and November 18, 1998), and computers other than 
that assigned to the individual in question (Attachment 4 (March 31, 1999).</P> 
<P>In January 2000, Applicant informed his supervisor that he had visited adult web sites while on duty (Response to FORM, at Paragraph 1, Attachment B at pp. 
2-3).  The supervisor counseled discretion but did not tell Applicant to stop accessing the web sites in question (<EM>Id</EM>., at Paragraph 1.a.).  Likewise, Applicant's 
line supervisor, in discussing a pending work evaluation, told Applicant that  he should not spend excessive time on the Internet (<EM>Id</EM>. at Para. 1.b.).  Both of 
these admonitions occurred some seven months before the August 29, 2000 memorandum (last page of Attachment 4 to Applicant's Response to SOR), in 
which the first written (and specific) company policy on computer use to access the Internet was issued.  Applicant's last use of company computers to access 
adult sites was in early July 2000, prior to his being promoted to supervisor on July 16, 2000.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, </P> 
<P>at Enclosure 2, sets forth policy factors that must be given "binding consideration" in making security clearance determinations.  The factors must be followed 
in every case, according to the pertinent criterion or criteria.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any specific case, 
nor can they supersede the exercise of an Administrative Judge's common sense and knowledge of relevant law and regulations. Because each security 
clearance case presents its own facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience or apply equally in every 
case.  Considering the evidence as a whole, and based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, I find the following specific adjudicative guideline to be most 
pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P>GUIDELINE E (Personal Conduct)  </P> 
<P><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
<P>Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
<P>E2.A5.1.2.1. - Reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances.  </P> 
<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
<P>E2.A51.2.1. - The information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment,  trustworthiness, or reliability, </P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  In reaching the fair and 
impartial overall common sense determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to 
speculate, but can only draw those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact, 
the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  </P> 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted on to safeguard classified information and 
material twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an applicant for a security 
clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may be involved in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability.  
These concerns include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard 
classified information.</P> 
<P>An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or 
information are denied or otherwise controverted by the Applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those controverted facts alleged in the 
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and establishes conduct that creates 
security concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to demonstrate that, despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national 
security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. </P> 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by 
DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold">    <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS </SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P>The bases for the SOR allegations, including specifically 2.a. are substantially statements made by Applicant.  In his June 13, 2000 sworn statement to a 
Defense Security Service (DSS) agent (GX 6), Applicant admitted the nature of his computer use. states:</P> 
<P>The Appeal Board has held that "misuse of a computer can be disqualifying under Guideline E even if there was no clear and precise policy against a particular 
type of computer misuse (ISCR Case No. 98-0265 (March17, 1999) at page 7, cited by Department Counsel in FORM).  Unlike the previous case, the present 
matter does not involve issues alleged under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior).  However, the term "pornographic" is clearly important to the Government's 
allegation under Guideline E, since it is mentioned directly or indirectly in all four SOR allegations on which the single Guideline E allegation is based.  </P> 
<P>For this reason, it has been necessary to determine whether Applicant's use of his company's computers can properly be construed as accessing pornographic 
web sites and material.  Considering all of the record information, I conclude the evidence of record does not show that some/most/all of the web sites were 
pornographic/obscene, nor did the Government attempt to do so.  Citing company documents attached to the Response to the SOR, Applicant contends 
Company A policy specifically allowed personal use of the company computers without restriction as to type of use. </P> 
<P>Applicant uses the term "pornographic" in his sworn statement to a Defense Security Service agent (GX 6).  As a general rule, an admission relieves the 
Government of having to independently prove the allegation.  In the present case, however, Applicant's admission that he accessed the Internet as cited in the 
SOR does not necessarily mean that he is correct that what he was viewing was "pornographic" by relevant legal standards. </P> 
<P>Overall, the record evidence demonstrates that Applicant's use of the company computers for personal activities: (1) was not unique to him; (2) was in fact 
known to his supervisors, who spoke with him about it but did not order him to stop; (3) did not prevent him from being promoted to supervisor in the Summer 
of 2000; (4) was stopped on his own volition because he recognized it was incompatible with his new responsibilities; and (5) was stopped prior to the issuance 
of specific company policy prohibiting any personal use.</P> 
<P>The core issue on remand is how the above information and facts, as discussed above, should be viewed under Guideline E. Even though this case does not 
involve any allegations made under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), such behavior is clearly relevant to any reasoned decision.  The facts of record in the 
present case do not come anywhere near the <EM>egregious</EM> end of the spectrum of adult or sexual-related activities, such as child pornography or violence against 
women.  The real issue is whether Applicants admitted misuse of the company computer raises a doubt about his ability and/or willingness to protect the 
nation's secrets.  I conclude that however tasteless and even questionable Applicant's conduct may have been to others, it does not rise to the level of making 
him a risk to national security. </P> 
<P>Viewing what he did under Guideline E, I conclude that DC 2 and DC 3 are inapplicable since there is no evidence of any falsifications or omissions and DC 6 
is inapplicable because there is no evidence of his association with persons involved in criminal activities.  </P> 
<P>DC 4 might have been applicable in that Applicant's conduct might have increased his vulnerability except that is now too far in the past and too widely known 
to constitute a risk.  DC 5 is not applicable since there is no pattern of dishonesty or rule violations alleged or suggested by the record, since the company rules 
and policies that could or would have covered Applicant's conduct were not issued until after the conduct stopped   </P> 
<P>DC 1 may be applicable in that there was "reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other 
acquaintances."  The information obtained from others at his company certainly qualifies as "unfavorable" but, as discussed above, it does not rise to the level 
of making him a risk to fail to protect classified information.  Clearly, Applicant's use of the company computers did not violate specific written policies, nor 
did it result in any punitive action by the company.  </P> 
<P>The people who know him best in the context of this matter are those at his company.  From what is in the record, as discussed above, his superiors counseled 
him but still thought highly enough of him to promote him, even after learning of his computer use.  Again, while Applicant was "cautioned" about his 
excessive use of the computer (FORM at page 5), he was not censured, reprimanded, fined, or otherwise disciplined.  In this context, I give considerable weight 
to his company's favorable action toward Applicant.  </P> 
<P>The real question is whether Applicant's conduct, as alleged in SOR 1.a. - 1.d., and incorporated by reference into SOR 2.a., constitutes the "questionable 
judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that] could indicate [he] may not 
properly safeguard classified information" (Directive, Guideline E). </P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>I conclude that a case has not been made under Guideline E (SOR 2.a.) because cause the underlying facts in this case do not establish the questionable 
judgment, unreliability and/or untrustworthiness that would make him a risk to the proper safeguarding of classified information.  </P> 
<P>Of all the Mitigating Conditions, only MC 1 is applicable, in the sense that the negative information was legally unsubstantiated, or at least not shown by the 
Government to be substantiated.  If DC 4 is applicable, then MC 5 is also applicable and more persuasive, since his conduct is now more widely known and 
consequently less likely to result in any pressure being placed on him. </P> 
<P>Overall, considering his positive record at the company, his position and evaluations, I conclude the risk of recurrence is minimal.  In complying with the 
directions of the Appeal Board, I have considered the totality of the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and factors, and have assessed 
Applicant's credibility based on the written record.  I conclude that the evidence favorable to Applicant significantly outweighs the unfavorable evidence (ISCR 
Case No. 98-0265 (March 19, 1999) at page 3).  </P>
