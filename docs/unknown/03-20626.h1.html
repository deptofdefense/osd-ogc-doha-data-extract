<P>On 14 December 2004, this case became subject to a moratorium on all cases involving application of 18 U.S.C. 986 pending receipt of implementing guidance 
for statutory changes made in October 2004.</P> 
<P>The background of the statutory changes to 18 U.S.C. 986 and affecting such cases may be summarized as follows:</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>. The memorandum provided policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precluded the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances. The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, 
Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to 
classified information and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act 21 U.S.C. 802);</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicated that provision 1, described above, "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and 
Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2004, Section 1062 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 was approved and adopted, amending 
portions of Subsection (c)(1) of section 986 of Title 10, United States Code, thereby altering it to read as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, <EM>and was incarcerated as a 
result of that sentence for not less than one year.</EM> (Emphasis of change supplied)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 14 December 2004, a moratorium was established on all cases involving 10 USC 986, including cases that would have been covered by the statute prior to 
its revision the month earlier. The moratorium was lifted on 3 August 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The memorandum lifting the moratorium contained no additional guidance for implementing the October 2004 statutory changes in cases subject to the 
moratorium. Nevertheless, as it appeared that the new statutory language might have some bearing on the outcome of this case, on 23 August 2005, I solicited 
the parties' views--by way of written closing argument--of the applicability of the new statutory language to the facts of this case. I gave the parties until 2 
September 2005 to provide their additional closing argument.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 1 September 2005, I received Department Counsel's closing argument, a copy of which he provided to Applicant. As of the date of this decision, I have 
received no additional closing argument from Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 2 February 2004 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation 
of Applicant's clearance because of criminal conduct.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant answered the SOR and requested hearing on 27 February 2004. The case was assigned to me 
on 15 July 2004. I convened a hearing on 9 August 2004. DOHA received the transcript on 20 August 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR. Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 28-year-old computer programmer for a defense contractor since June 2002--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously had a 
clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 24 August 1997, Applicant--then 21 and attending an out-of-state college--was arrested and charged with, among other things, aggravated assault when he 
and three friends got into a fist fight outside a bar in a college town in his home state. Applicant and his friends had drunk quite a bit, as had the putative 
victims. Applicant was the only one arrested, as his friends escaped the police and Applicant refused to identify them. He was later convicted of aggravated 
assault, sentenced to 18-30 months imprisonment, and served approximately 13 months (July 1998 to August 1999), divided equally between the regular prison 
population and a state-run boot camp program.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's crime and punishment  were  life-altering events, both good and bad. At the time of his crime, he had completed his third year at the out-of-state 
school where he was enrolled in a five-year program that was to culminate in receiving both his undergraduate and master's degrees in education. He was also 
an inter-collegiate wrestler on the varsity wrestling team. Although he was able to postpone his trial and complete his fourth year of the program, his conviction 
and sentence kept him from completing the program and obtaining his degrees. Applicant had hoped to emulate his father, a life-long educator and coach.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">However, Applicant responded to his new circumstances extremely well. He was the honor graduate of his boot camp program and was successfully discharged 
from parole in July 2001. When he left prison in August 1999, he started classes at the local community college. He worked at a variety of jobs to support 
himself. He later transferred to the state university and received his degree in computer science in December 2001. After Applicant got a job in his new career 
field in June 2002, he and his childhood sweetheart bought a house in July 2002. They married in December 2002. They had their first child in June 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's character witnesses included his wife, mother-in-law, father, co-workers and supervisors from his current job, and supervisors from his earlier jobs. 
Each was aware of Applicant's criminal record. Each witness who knew Applicant both before and after the August 1997 crime considered the crime an 
aberration. Each considered him an honest and trustworthy individual. His co-workers and supervisors praised the quality of his work and his work ethic.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no record of violent conduct since the 1997 arrest. He did have a DUI offense in 2003 that he disclosed to Department Counsel during pre-hearing preparations.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is  Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 amended Title 10 U.S. Code to add a new section, &sect; 986 [the 
Smith Amendment], precluding the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense (DoD) under four specific circumstances. 
On 7 June 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued implementing regulations under DoD 5200.2-R; the Director, DOHA issued Operating Instruction 64 
(O.I. 64) on 10 July 2001. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2004, Section 1062 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 was approved 
and adopted, amending portions of &sect;986 of Title 10, United States Code, to provided, in pertinent part , that Applicants be both sentenced to prison for more 
than one year and be "incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The amendments further provided that waivers "may be authorized 
only in accordance with standards and procedures prescribed by, or under the authority of, an Executive order or other guidance issued by the President."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline J case by demonstrating that Applicant was convicted of aggravated assault in 1998, was sentenced to 18-30 months 
imprisonment, and served 13 months divided between prison and a state boot camp.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Nevertheless, I would ordinarily find the conduct mitigated. The crime 
occurred in August 1997.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant had no criminal conduct before this incident and no violent conduct since.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant's character references and his work 
record demonstrate the extent to which he has transformed his life since his arrest.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Unfortunately, Applicant's criminal conduct cannot be mitigated under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, even as amended. The statute requires that I not grant Applicant's 
clearance because he was sentenced to 18-30 months imprisonment and served a total of 13 months in prison and boot camp.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Accordingly, I conclude 
Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Having denied Applicant's clearance solely because of the requirements of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, OI 64 requires me to make a recommendation--without 
explanation--whether this case should be considered for meritorious waiver.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> OI 64 implements the requirements of the Deputy Secretary of Defense 
emorandum of 7 June 2001.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> However, the Appeal Board has recently ruled that administrative judges lack the legal authority to make the required 
recommendation under the amendments to the waiver language in the statute.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The Appeal Board  equates a recommendation for waiver by the Administrative 
Judge with a decision by the Secretary concerned to grant a waiver and it presumes that no appropriate guidance exists for processing waiver requests. 
Nevertheless, the amended waiver language<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> does not void--expressly or by implication--the requirements of OI 64, which are ministerial only. Nor does it 
void the procedural requirements of the 7 June 2001 Memorandum.<A HREF="03-20626.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> The administrative judge is not the waiver authority under either version of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 
986, and the waiver authority is not bound in any fashion to follow the recommendation. Further, the required recommendation is made without explanation, 
and thus without reference to any factors, whether mandated by implementing guidance or instructions to the original statute or later mandated in compliance 
with the new statutory language. Consequently, any waiver recommendation made in compliance with OI 64 complies with the plain language of the amended 
waiver provision. Alternatively, any error in making the required recommendation is, at worst, harmless error. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude that I may note what my 
recommendation would have been had I the authority to do so. Recognizing my recommendation is not binding on the waiver authority, I would have 
recommended further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

whatever bearing it might have in assessing the Guideline J offense that was alleged or any potential recommendation under OI 64. The record reflects that the 
DUI occurred when Applicant, his wife, and several friends went out to a going-away dinner for friends of his from work. Applicant states he had four beers 
over the time they were out and did not think he was too impaired to drive. However, he was stopped and failed a B.A.C. test, registering .11%. He completed 
the requirements of his sentence, including an alcohol awareness course. He has not been assessed as alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. He currently
