<P>Applicant's May 2004 conviction for Indecent Exposure raises security concerns under criminal conduct and sexual behavior. Although he has successfully completed two years of  probation, four 
years remain. Considering his admitted history of similar conduct approximately 150 times prior to his arrest, it is too soon to conclude that he has been successfully rehabilitated.  Applicant did not 
meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under criminal conduct and sexual behavior. Applicant's eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On September 13, 2004, Applicant submitted an application for a position of public trust - an ADP I/II/III position. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant the 
application under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> On July 10, 2006,  
DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline J, 
Criminal Conduct, and Guideline D, Sexual Behavior.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>July 28, 2006<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A notice of hearing was issued on 
September 18, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>October 5, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted on that date. The government submitted three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov 
Ex) 1-3, and admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted two exhibits which were marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-B without objection. 
</SPAN>DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 13, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his SOR response, Applicant admits to all of the allegations in the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, 
and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 38 years old and is employed as a phone center specialist with a Department of Defense contractor since September 2004.  He is a team leader.  He is seeking a position of public trust.  
He has two years of college.  He is married but his wife filed for divorce in May 2006.  He has two daughters, ages 15 and 7.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 3, 2004, Applicant was driving back from a dental appointment. He drove by two young women, who were 17 years old, and asked them if they needed a ride. They said "No."  He drove 
around the block and drove by them again and asked them once again if they needed a ride.  At some point during this encounter, Applicant was masturbating. The young women got Applicant's 
license plate number and reported the incident to the police.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 5, 2004, Applicant was called in by the sheriff's department for questioning. He initially denied his conduct but eventually admitted to the offense. He was arrested and charged with two 
counts of Obscenity - Promotion to Minor, a felony and one count of Indecent Exposure to Minors and Adults, a misdemeanor.  He pled guilty to Indecent Exposure and the two other charges were 
dismissed.  He was sentenced to six years supervised probation, fined $5,750, ordered to mandatory group therapy for sex based offenders, and ordered to take mandatory polygraph tests. He was 
also ordered to register as a sex offender. He is not allowed to have contact with minor children to include his two daughters.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">So far, Applicant has followed the terms of his probation.  His probation will not end until  2010.  He attends group therapy every Monday evening. It is a sex offender based therapy group. He is 
learning to understand what causes his behavior. He does not attend individual therapy.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> He admits to encountering some stumbling blocks in the therapy process.  In May 2006, he attempted 
suicide by swallowing eight sleeping pills.  Since his suicide attempt, he is working the program the therapists have set up for him.  He is becoming more involved and interactive in the group.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits to engaging in similar exhibitionist behavior approximately 150 times prior to his May 2004 arrest. He was arrested on one other occasion when he was eighteen. He has not 
engaged in similar conduct since his May 2004 arrest.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  He denies any inappropriate touching or exposing himself to his daughters.  He indicates that when his oldest daughter was five she walked 
in on him while he was masturbating.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From January 25, 2005, to April 5, 2005, Applicant served in the United States Army.  He received a discharged in lieu of court-martial with an under other than honorable conditions discharge.  It 
was alleged that he entered the women's shower area while naked and touched a female soldier on her breast and buttocks.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is highly regarded at his place of employment. A co-worker, who is a supervisor at the call center where Applicant works, testified at hearing.  She describes him as being honest and 
reliable. His handling of sensitive information, such as social security numbers and medical records, is very professional. She is aware of the allegations in the SOR.  She still believes he is an asset 
to the company.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  His manager submitted a letter on Applicant's behalf.  He works with him daily.  He describes Applicant as being "dependable, honest , trustworthy and reliable in the 
performance of his duties." He has no reason to suspect his integrity or loyalty to his job, company or country.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife wrote a letter on his behalf. She has known her husband for over 17 years. She indicates her husband has a tremendous work ethic and takes pride in his job.  She says he is 
supportive of his co-workers and is a true asset and model for customer service.<A HREF="06-09383.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> </P>

security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines, are set forth and

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. I make the following conclusions.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct </STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Based on all the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally 
charged</EM>)<EM> </EM>applies to Applicant's case.  Applicant admits to indecently exposing himself to two young women on May 5, 2006.  He was initially charged with two felony counts and a misdemeanor 
offense. He pled guilty to the misdemeanor offense. There is no issue that his conduct was criminal.</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC).  I cannot apply CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>).  The criminal behavior is recent. The offense 
occurred in May 2004.  I cannot apply CC MC E2.A6.1.3.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) since Applicant admits to committing similar offenses approximately 150 times prior to his arrest. </P> 
 
<P>There is nothing in the record evidence to support the application of CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (<EM>The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present 
in that person's life</EM>); CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 (<EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>); and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.5 (<EM>Acquittal</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been meeting the terms of his probation for over two years.  He has four more years of probation before he successfully completes the terms of his probation.  Since he has only 
completed one third of his probationary term, I cannot conclude that CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) applies. Since he is still serving probation and has a 
past history of similar behavior, questions remain as to whether he will be able to successfully resolve the problem which caused these behaviors. Applicant is making progress but it is too soon to 
conclude that he has been successfully rehabilitated. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has failed to mitigate the concern under Guideline J.</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Sexual Behavior</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under the sexual behavior concern several disqualifying conditions apply. Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Condition (SB DC) E2.A4.1.2.1 (<EM>Sexual Behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the 
individual has been prosecuted</EM>) applies.  Applicant's actions on May 3, 2004, can be considered criminal sexual behavior since he indecently exposed himself to two young women.     </P> 
 
<P>SB DC E2.A4.1.2.3 (<EM>Sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>) applies.  Applicant's conduct is of such a sensitive nature that one can easily 
conclude that Applicant could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress.<EM> </EM>While Applicant disclosed the arrest to his family and several friends, the conduct committed is not something a 
reasonable person would want disclosed.  </P> 
 
<P>SB DC E2.A4.1.2.4 (<EM>Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment</EM>) applies.  Applicant's actions were public.  He masturbated in his car on a city street 
in broad daylight.  The two young 17 year old women noticed his actions since they reported it to the police.  Applicant was 36 years old at the time of the offense.  He was old enough to know 
better.  His actions showed a lack of discretion and judgment.</P> 
 
<P>The sexual behavior concern can be mitigated.  I find that none of the mitigating conditions apply.  Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition (SB MC) E2.A4.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior occurred during or 
prior to adolescence and there is not evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature</EM>) does not apply.  Applicant was an adult at the time of his last offense.  He admits to committing acts of 
exhibitionism at least 150 times prior to his last offense.  One can conclude not all of these offenses occurred when he was an adolescent.</P> 
 
<P>SB MC E2.A4.1.3.2 (<EM>The behavior was not recent and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature</EM>) does not apply.  Although there is no evidence of similar conduct occurring 
after Applicant's arrest, the behavior was recent.  SB MC E2.A4.1.3.3 (<EM>There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability</EM>) is not applicable considering 
Applicant's admitted history of committing similar acts.  The conduct which led to his discharge from the Army also raises questions about his judgment.  Although I find Applicant to have been 
forthcoming during the hearing, the sensitive nature of his past conduct still leaves him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation or duress.  As such SB MC E2.A4.1.3.4 (<EM>The behavior no longer serves 
as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>) does not apply.  </P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a 
person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive duties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in 
considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own 
merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>I have considered all the evidence and the "whole person" in evaluating Applicant's trustworthiness. An applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has 
negative trustworthiness implications. Although Applicant is meeting the terms of his probation, he still has four more years to serve. It is too soon to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the 
criminal conduct and sexual behavior concerns. He was a mature adult at the time of his last offense.  He has history of committing similar sexual offenses, and is still on probation for this offense. I 
am persuaded by the totality of the evidence that he failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding Guidelines J and D, and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility is denied.</P>
