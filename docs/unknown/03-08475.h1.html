<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has held a security clearance for about 20 years.  In October 1998, Applicant was arrested and 
charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, but the charges were later dismissed.  On a security clearance application in November 1999, Applicant 
falsely concealed the charge.  In July 2001, Applicant had an alcohol-related driving offense, resulting in a criminal conviction.  Thereafter, he completed an 
alcohol-rehabilitation program and has had no alcohol-related incidents since that time.  Applicant has mitigated the concerns arising from his alcohol 
consumption, but failed to mitigate concerns arising from his personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant under Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive").  On May 6, 2004, DOHA 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, 
and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on June 2, 2004.  Applicant elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. </P> 
<P>I was assigned the case on October 14, 2004.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on November 17, 2004.  The department counsel 
moved, without objection, to amend the allegation of &para; 2.a of the SOR by striking the words, "executed by you on," and I granted the motion.  Tr. at 16.  The 
government introduced eight exhibits.  Applicant's counsel presented 15 exhibits, the testimony of a witness, and Applicant's testimony.  I left the record open 
for five days for Applicant's counsel to submit an authenticated copy of a document.  Applicant's representative forwarded the document on November 17, 
2004, and Department Counsel acknowledged receipt and the lack of objection on November 23, 2004.  I received and admitted the document on November 24, 
2005.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 9, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant denied the allegation in &para; 2.a of the SOR that he intentionally falsified materials facts on a security clearance application.  With regard to the traffic 
citations contained in the allegations in &para;&para; 2.c, 2.d, 2.g, and 2.h of the SOR, Applicant replied that he did not deny receiving the citations, but did not remember 
them.  He admitted the factual allegations in &para; 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 2.b, 2.e and 2.f of the SOR, with explanations.  Those admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 44 years old.  Ex.1 at 1.  He first began using alcohol in high school at age 16 or 17, drinking beer on occasion.  Ex.6 at 3; Ex. 7 at 1; Ex. K at 1.  
Between the ages of 18 and 24, while in college and shortly thereafter, he drank about three or four times a month in varying amounts up to about six beers.  Ex. 
7 at 1; Ex. K at 1.  </P> 
<P>Applicant holds master's degrees in both electrical engineering and computer science and engineering.  Ex. 7 at 1; Tr. at 48.  Applicant began working for a 
defense contractor as a project engineer in 1985.  Ex. 1 at 3.  He obtained a security clearance in 1985 and has held it for about 20 years.  Tr. at 34, 65.</P> 
<P>In 1997, Applicant began working for his present employer, a defense contractor, as a principal engineer.  Ex. 1 at 3.  His supervisors, co-workers, and 
government counterparts praise his professional qualifications, talents, judgment, character, and ability to handle classified information.  Exs. A-I, inclusive, 
Exs. L and M; Tr. at 28-29, 32.</P> 
<P>One evening in October 1998, Applicant went out with friends.  Ex. 7 at 2.  He had just broken up with his girlfriend and his friends encouraged him to drink 
shots of alcohol.  <EM>Id.  </EM>Applicant drank to the point of blacking out.  <EM>Id.</EM>  While a friend was driving Applicant home, the automobile broke down on a bridge.  
Ex. 6 at 2.  The driver went for help, leaving Applicant with the vehicle.  <EM>Id.</EM>  The police arrived and arrested Applicant.  <EM>Id.</EM>  His blood-alcohol concentration 
was .24 %.  Ex. 7 at 4.  The police cited Applicant for driving under the influence.  Ex. 6 at 2.  A judge later dismissed the charges because Applicant's friend 
was driving the vehicle.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P>In November 1999, Applicant completed an SF 86, Security Clearance Application, to up-date or continue his security clearance.  Question 24 on the form 
asked, "Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs?"  Ex. 1 at 7.  Applicant answered "No" to the question.  
Question 26 on the SF 86 asked, "In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 
24, or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.)" Applicant answered "No" to this question.</P> 
<P>Between 1998 and 2000, Applicant received numerous citations for violating traffic laws.  These violations include:</P> 
<P>- August 1998 - Speeding (96 mph in a 60 mph zone); crossing/straddling the center line; driving on shoulder.  Ex. 3 at 11; Tr. at 38.</P> 
<P>- July 1999 - Speeding (70 mph in a 60 mph zone).  Ex. 3 at 11.</P> 
<P>- July 1999 - Seat belt violation; registration violation-no tabs; missing, obscured or altered license plate.  Ex. 3 at 11; Tr. at 38.</P> 
<P>- February 2000 - Disobey road sign, accident while moving.</P> 
<P>- March 2000 - Driving while license suspended; speeding (35 mph in 25 mph zone); no vehicle license plates.  Ex. 2 at 1-2; Ex. 3 at 11. </P> 
<P>- March 2000 - Driving with expired license tags.  Ex. 2 at 3.</P> 
<P>In July 2001, a police officer pulled over Applicant for speeding and drifting over the lane divider.  Ex. 3 at 4.  The police officer noticed the odor of alcohol on 
Applicant's breath and asked if he had been drinking.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant said "Yes," and agreed to take a field sobriety test.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant failed the field sobriety 
test.  A portable breath test indicated a blood-alcohol concentration of .191 %.  <EM>Id.</EM>  When the patrolman found an open container in his vehicle, Applicant 
volunteered that he was, "drunk from a bar."  <EM>Id.</EM>  The police officer took Applicant to the station.  Applicant consulted his attorney and thereafter refused to 
consent to a breath test.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 5.  The state charged Applicant with driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drugs.  Ex. 3 at 1.</P> 
<P>In August 2001, while the criminal charges were pending, Applicant enrolled in an alcohol assessment program.  Ex. 7 at 1.  Applicant believed the program 
was run by certified counselors.  Ex. 6 at 3.  The counselor's diagnosis  for Applicant was Alcohol Abuse according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for 
ental Disorders (DSM) VI, 305.0.  Ex. 7 at 2.  Applicant attended weekly therapy and counseling sessions and abstained from using alcohol for the six-month 
program.  Ex. 7 at 4; Tr. at 42.  </P> 
<P>In February 2002, Applicant pled guilty to an amended charge of negligent driving in the first degree.  The court accepted the plea, found him guilty of the 
offense, and sentenced him to 90 days in jail (with 90 days suspended), and a $1,000.00 fine (with $440.00 suspended).  Ex. 4 at 3.  The suspension period was 
24 months, on the condition of no further criminal violations, no alcohol-related infractions, not driving a vehicle without a license and insurance, and 
completion of the DUI victim's panel within 60 days.  <EM>Id.  </EM>Applicant paid the fine and costs in the total amount of $685.00, and completed the DUI victim's 
panel.  <EM>Id.</EM> </P> 
<P>In February 2002, Applicant's employer notified the Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) of Applicant's conviction for negligent driving.  Ex. 
5.  Thereafter, a security investigator questioned Applicant about his alcohol consumption.  In Exhibit 6, a written statement dated October 18, 2002, Applicant 
described his normal consumption of alcohol as follows:</P> 
<P>I don't normally drink to the point where I become intoxicated, however, maybe five to ten times a year, I will become intoxicated.  When intoxicated I will 
have about four or five beers.  The last time I was intoxicated was about two months ago.</P> 
<P>. . .</P> 
<P>My use of alcohol has remained about the same throughout the years.  I use alcohol socially, normally, at home, and sometimes at parties or in restaurants.</P> 
<P>. . .</P> 
<P>I would guess I will continue to use alcohol in the future as I have in the past.</P> 
<P>In response to the initiation of this action, Applicant's counsel referred him for evaluation by a psychologist.  Ex. K.  After reviewing the available evidence, the 
results of psychological testing, and the interviews of Applicant, the psychologist opined Applicant's history of alcohol abuse was "within normal limits."  Ex. 
4 at 3.  The psychologist concluded Applicant possesses no more than the "normal" risk for alcohol abuse and is at very low risk for alcohol dependence.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P>At the hearing, Applicant testified about his alcohol consumption.  Department counsel asked how often he drinks enough to become intoxicated.  Applicant 
volunteered that he did it a few times a year but not since the offense in July 2001 leading to his conviction.  Tr. at 51.  Department counsel confronted 
Applicant with his written statement from October 2002, quoted above, in which he admitted becoming intoxicated five to ten times per years, and admitted 
that he had been intoxicated since the offense in July 2001.  Applicant responded that it depended upon the definition of intoxicated.  Tr. at 57.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets out certain conditions under Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, that are potentially disqualifying.  Paragraph E2.A7.1.2.1 provides that, 
"[a]lcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence . . . or other criminal incidents related to alcohol abuse," may be disqualifying.  
Applicant admitted he was convicted of negligent driving and that his conduct was alcohol-related.  Ex. K at 1.  Additionally, in October 1998 Applicant drank 
alcohol in public until he blacked out; a later test found his blood-alcohol concentration was .24%.  I find that this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A7.1.2.4 of the Directive, it is potentially disqualifying if a "licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment 
plan" gives an applicant an evaluation of "alcohol abuse."  Applicant was diagnosed with "alcohol abuse" in August 2001, following the incident which 
ultimately led to his conviction.  Ex. 7 at 2.  I find this potentially disqualifying condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also sets out various conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from alcohol consumption.  Under &para; E2.A7.1.3.1 of the Directive, it 
may be mitigating where, "[t]he alcohol-related incidents do not indicate a pattern."  The evidence shows two instances where Applicant was out socially and 
drank to excess, resulting in his arrest.  In Applicant's statement dated October 18, 2002, he admitted drinking alcohol to the point of intoxication between five 
and ten times a year.  Considering all the evidence, I am not persuaded this potentially mitigating condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A7.1.3.2 provides that it may be mitigating where, "[t]he problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem."  
The two alcohol-related incidents resulting in Applicant's arrest occurred in 1998 and 2001, respectively, therefore they  were a number of years ago.  Applicant 
denied having any alcohol-related incidents since then, and there is no available evidence to the contrary.  I conclude this potentially mitigating condition 
applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be mitigating where an applicant demonstrates, "[p]ositive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety."  Directive, &para; E2.A7.1.3.3.  Applicant 
completed an alcohol rehabilitation program after the incident in July 2001.  Ex. 7 at 4.  Applicant testified at the hearing that now he does not drink more than 
one or two drinks when he is out socially, and that he rarely drinks at home.  Tr. at 53-54.  However, his testimony is contradicted by his written statement dated 
October 18, 2002, in which he indicated he drinks several beers at home during the week, and drinks alcohol to the point of intoxication between five and ten 
times a year.  Ex. 6 at 3-4.  In the statement, Applicant also indicated his use of alcohol has remained the same over the years and that he intends to continue 
using alcohol in the same way in the future.  Ex. 6 at 4.  Considering all the evidence Applicant has not persuaded me that he has made positive changes in 
support of sobriety.  I find this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A7.1.3.4 of the Directive, it may be mitigating where:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with 
aftercare requirements, participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at 
least 12 months, and received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a 
recognized alcohol treatment program. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was given a diagnosis of "alcohol abuse," and completed an outpatient alcohol rehabilitation program.  Also, his counsel submitted a favorable 
prognosis from a credentialed medical professional.  However, the evidence does not reflect that he participates frequently in meetings of Alcoholics 
Anonymous or a similar organization, or that he abstained from alcohol for 12 months or more.  I find this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  The alcohol-related incidents occurred several years 
ago, and there is no indication of a recent problem.  Applicant also successfully completed an alcohol-rehabilitation program.  I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated any potential security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets out various factors relevant to an applicant's personal conduct that may be potentially disqualifying.  Paragraph E2.A5.1.2.1 of the Directive 
provides that "reliable, unfavorable information" showing questionable personal conduct may be disqualifying.  Similarly, under &para; E2.A5.1.2.5 of the Directive, 
a pattern of "rule violations" may be disqualifying.  The available evidence shows that between 1998 and 2001, Applicant engaged in numerous violations of 
the state traffic code.  Many were similar or repeated violations, indicating a flagrant disregard for the law.  Applicant admitted many of these, and the 
government's evidence establishes the remaining allegations.  While any one offense, standing alone, is relatively minor, the pattern of these offenses suggests 
an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  I find these potentially disqualifying conditions apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 of the Directive, "[t]he deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire" may be disqualifying.  The SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to report his arrest in October 1998 on an alcohol-related charge.  
Applicant asserts he did not intend to misrepresent material facts in answer to Question 24.  He maintains he "never went to an arraignment for being formally 
charged or posted bail or anything." Tr. at 36.  Therefore, he contends he "believed that I hadn't really been charged with a crime." <EM>Id.</EM>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I note, however, Applicant admitted he had received a citation for the offense.  He had received other citations for other offenses before completing the SF 86 in 
November 1999, so he had reason to know it constituted a criminal charge.  Moreover, in his statement to the investigator about the October 1998 incident, 
Applicant reported that he was "taken to the police station, was booked and they sent me home in a taxi.  I went to court in Seattle where the charges were 
dismissed as my friend was driving."  The statement indicating he was "booked" and that the charges were "dismissed" fairly indicates Applicant knew he had 
been charged with an offense.  Finally, Question  26 on the SF 86 asked whether Applicant had been arrested, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not 
listed in the questions above, including Question 24.  If Applicant really believed he had only been arrested-not charged-for the October 1998 incident, he 
should have reported it in response to this question.  However, Applicant answered, "No," to Question 26.  I conclude Applicant deliberately omitted and 
concealed relevant and material facts by falsely answering "No" on Question 24 of his personnel security clearance questionnaire.  This potentially 
disqualifying condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, the security concerns arising from questionable personal conduct may be mitigated under certain circumstances.  Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.3.  
Under &para; E2.A5.1.3.1, it may be mitigating where "[t]he information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or 
reliability."  Applicant's admissions and the government evidence demonstrate the information is substantiated.  Also, Applicant's alcohol abuse and his pattern 
of rule violations are pertinent to a determination of his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.  I find this mitigating factor does not apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A5.1.3.2 of the Directive arises where "the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual subsequently provided correct 
information voluntarily."  Applicant's false statement on his SF 86 occurred in November 1999, therefore it was not recent.  Applicant subsequently provided 
accurate information about the incident in his statement to the investigator dated October 18, 2002; however Applicant has not shown whether he did so 
voluntarily, or whether the investigator first confronted Applicant with the fact of his criminal charge.  Most significantly, I am not convinced Applicant's false 
statement was an isolated incident.  At the hearing, after being reminded of his duty to tell the truth, Applicant testified that he had not been intoxicated since 
the July 2001 incident, and that he drank only a small amount of alcohol.  These statements were inconsistent with his sworn statement to the investigator.  I 
found his proffered explanation unconvincing.  For this reason, I cannot find Applicant's falsification on his SF 86 was an isolated incident.  I conclude this 
potentially mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, it may be mitigating where, "[t]he individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the 
facts."  As noted above, on October 18, 2002, Applicant provided an accurate statement concerning his arrest and charges arising from the incident in October 
1998.  However, Applicant has not met his burden of proving that he initiated the efforts at correction, or that his efforts were prompt.  I find this potentially 
mitigating condition does not apply.  I also considered carefully the other potentially mitigating conditions and conclude they do not apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns arising from his personal conduct.</SPAN></P>
