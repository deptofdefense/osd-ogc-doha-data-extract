<P>Applicant was born in Israel and is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  His mother, sister and brother are citizens of and reside in Israel.  His wife and three children are

<P>On February 4, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleged security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B, Foreign Influence; Guideline C, Foreign Preference; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement signed </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">March 3, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to another

Applicant's counsel asked for a delay until February 8, 2006, which was granted.  The hearing occurred on February 8, 2006.  The government had one witness 
and submitted seven exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1-7. The exhibits were admitted into the record without objection.  The 
government requested that administrative notice be taken on nine documents. The documents were marked as roman numerals I - IX. Applicant  testified on his 
own behalf and submitted three exhibits which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-C. The record was held open until February 22, 2006.  No additional

to read in Hebrew.  He occasionally printed certain articles or cartoons onto the unclassified printer within the work area. In January 2004, the Facility Security 
Officer (FSO) told him to stop printing foreign printed material on the printer in the closed area. She told him it was a bad security practice.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  Applicant was 
not aware that there was anything wrong with printing foreign printed material on the unclassified computer in the closed area.  He did not try to hide his 
activity. When the FSO first told him not to print foreign printed material on the printer in the closed area he asked his supervisor for advice.  His supervisor 
told him to print the material on the printer that is outside of the closed area.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The printer that was located outside of the closed area was not Applicant's default printer since he only used it on occasion to print articles that were written in

April 2004, it was brought to the FSO's attention that Applicant had printed foreign printed material on the unclassified computer in the closed area.  She spoke

area.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A>  The FSO also submitted a suspicious incident report to the Defense Security Service.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P>

several articles printed in Hebrew on the unclassified computer in the closed area and brought them to the attention of Applicant's supervisor.  In January 2005, 
his supervisor told him that under no circumstances should he print documents written in Hebrew in the closed area anymore.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> His supervisor warned him that 
if he had any future incidents that he would be taken off the classified program and it would look unfavorably on his record and career.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  He stopped printing

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Applicant provided translations of the documents printed in Hebrew which the FSO had confiscated.  Each of the documents were printed from

what was being printed.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> The National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) has no rule pertaining to printing foreign material in a closed

Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B - Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she 
may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential 
for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other foreign countries or financial interests in 
other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.(Directive &para; 
E2.A2.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C - Foreign Preference:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she 
may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E - Personal Conduct:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control Communications, and Intelligence (ASD/C3I) issued a memorandum to clarify, 
Guideline C, Foreign Preference, relative to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  "The possession and use of a foreign passport in 
preference to a United States passport raises doubt as to whether the person's allegiance to the United States is paramount and it could also facilitate foreign 
travel unverifiable by the United States.  Therefore, consistent application of the guideline requires that any  clearance must be denied or revoked unless the 
applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States Government."<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information 
about the person.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A>  <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="04-06114.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> An

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence; Guideline C, Foreign Preference; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the foreign influence concern, a potentially disqualifying condition is raised. The Government has established that Applicant has immediate relatives 
who are citizens of and reside in a foreign country.  His mother, brother and sister reside are citizens of and reside in Israel. As such, Foreign Influence 
Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1: (<EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a 
citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>) applies.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1: (<EM>A determination that immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, 
brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associates) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that 
could force the individual to choose between the loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>) is applicable to this case. Applicant's wife and three 
children, although dual citizens of the United States and Israel, reside with him in the United States. I find they are not agents of a foreign power and are not in 
a position to be exploited by a foreign power. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record evidence and the testimony at the hearing established that Applicant's mother, brother and sister are not agents of a foreign power.  Applicant also 
has the burden to meet the second prong of FI MC 1 which is whether his relatives living in Israel would be in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to his relatives and the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In analyzing whether a foreign relative is in a position of vulnerability it is necessary to assess the nature of the foreign countries involved.  Israel is a

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be completely ruled out as long as Applicant's mother and siblings are citizens of and reside in a foreign 
country, his substantial ties to and preference for the United States lead me to conclude he can be trusted to place his obligation to the United States government 
ahead of any sense of obligation to his family members residing in Israel.  His wife and children reside with him in the United States.  All of his financial assets 
are in the United States.  Since moving to the United States in 1987, he has traveled to Israel only three times.  He has kept his security office informed of his 
travel each time.  He has a demonstrated track record of protecting our nation's secrets.  He has worked on classified projects for the United States since 1989.  
His mother and two siblings were citizens of and resided in Israel during his previous security clearance background investigations.  There have been no 
significant changes regarding his mother and two siblings' status in this current periodic reinvestigation. I find Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence 
concern.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>C - Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under the Foreign Preference concern.  Applicant is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel.  The Government has 
also shown Applicant renewed his Israeli passport after becoming a United States citizen and that he used his Israeli passport in August 2001.  As such, Foreign 
Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) E2.A3.1.2.1: ( <EM>The exercise of dual citizenship</EM>) applies as well as FP DC E2.A3.1.2.2: (<EM>Possession and/or use of a 
foreign passport</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since Applicant served mandatory military service from 1976 to 1979 in the Israeli Army FP DC E2.A3.1.2.3 (<EM>Military service or willingness to bear arms for 
a foreign country</EM>) applies.  However, his foreign military service occurred prior to Applicant becoming a US citizen. Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition 
(FP MC) E2.A3.1.3.2 (<EM>Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service occurred before obtaining United States citizenship</EM>) applies to 
this allegation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FP MC E2.A3.1.3.1: (<EM>Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country</EM>) applies since Applicant acquired his foreign 
citizenship by birth. FP MC E2.A3.1.3.4: (<EM>Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship</EM>) applies since he is willing to renounce his Israeli 
citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although there is some concern that Applicant applied for and used an Israeli passport after becoming a United States citizen, he was not fully aware of the 
security concerns related to possessing and traveling on a foreign passport.  He consulted his security office each time he traveled to Israel.  He decided to 
renew and travel on his Israeli passport in 2001 because he heard that Israel required it.  His passport has since expired.  He destroyed the passport. I find his 
testimony credible.  In April 2004, he became aware of the security concern regarding possession and use of a foreign passport.  The ASD/C3I memorandum 
requires individuals to surrender their foreign passport or obtain official approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States government.  
Since Applicant destroyed his passport, he no longer has a passport to surrender.  The ASD/C3I memorandum does not apply to his situation.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does not intend to renew his Israeli passport and intends to only travel on his United States passport in the future.  In 2004, he traveled on his US 
passport during his trip to Israel. Applicant has mitigated the foreign preference security concern.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Government has not established a concern under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  Although the FSO was concerned about Applicant printing 
foreign material in a closed work area, there is no NISPOM provision or company security policy dealing with the printing of foreign material in closed areas. 
The documents were printed on an unclassified computer.  Applicant did not try to hide his actions.  He was not aware he was doing anything wrong.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant did not understand the significance of the issue until he was told by his supervisor in January 2005 that he would be removed from the classified 
program he was working on if he continued to print foreign printed matter in the closed area. Since being counseled by his supervisor that his actions could 
have serious consequences to his career, he has stopped reading and printing foreign material at work. I find for the Applicant under Guideline E.        <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
