<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 15, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-01184.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) and Guideline E ( personal conduct). Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR, 
dated July 28, 2004, admitted the allegations contained in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, denied the allegations contained in subparagraphs 1.c and 2.a, 
and requested a hearing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on September 6, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on September 15, 2005, scheduling the hearing for November 2, 2005. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified and submitted eleven documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-11, and 
admitted into the record without objection. The transcript was received on November 17, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 66 years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since July 2000, presently as a dispatcher. She was initially hired as a security officer, 
and had previously worked in that field for other employers since at least 1992. She possessed a secret security clearance from 1983 until 1991. No complaints 
were made during that time alleging she mishandled or risked the compromise of classified information, and no previous action was ever taken to revoke her 
security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was married in March 1961, and that marriage ended in divorce in June 1971. She remarried in February 1972, that marriage ended in divorce in 
August 1978, and she has been single since that time. Applicant has three adult children ranging in age from 32 to 44. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In approximately 1993, Applicant let her son use her store credit card for the sole purpose of buying a car seat for his infant child. The son abused the card and 
made substantial purchases with the card that were not authorized by Applicant. She attempted to dispute the charges with the store, and made payments on the 
bill for a period of time until she decided she could no longer afford to make any payments. The account was listed as 30 days delinquent as of April 1997 (GE 
4), and no further payment has ever been made. The account was written off with a balance of $4,412.00 past due as of October 2003 (GE 4). The account no 
longer appears on Applicant's credit report (GE 6), most likely because of the passage of time.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was laid off from a job that had been paying her $13.86 per hour in September 1991. She could thereafter only find employment that paid her $5.25 
per hour. She was unsuccessful in her efforts to stay current on her bills with the greatly reduced salary, and was forced to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
protection in June 1995. She listed unsecured claims totaling $16,149.00 and secured claims totaling $31,350.00 in her bankruptcy petition. She obtained a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge on October 25, 1995.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant received approximately $60,000.00 from her retirement account when she was laid off that was rolled-over into an individual retirement account 
(IRA). She thereafter withdrew money from the IRA to supplement her reduced income and to spend gambling at casinos without having taxes withheld. As a 
result, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a tax lien against her on March 22, 1996, in the amount of $5,700.00. She established a repayment plan with the 
IRS, and the lien was satisfied as of August 2001 (GE 6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been playing slot machines at gambling casinos since she was 16 years old. Although she denies having a gambling problem, her family 
physician referred her to a counselor to discuss her gambling habit in about 1990, and she attended gamblers' anonymous meetings for a short period of time in 
about 1994 at the urging of her sister. She does not remember how it came about that her doctor referred her to a counselor. She believes her sister's religious 
beliefs are what caused her sister to recommend she attend gamblers' anonymous meetings.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant lost approximately $20,000.00 of the money from her IRA in casinos during the12 months preceding the filing of her bankruptcy petition (GE 5). In 
1999, and again in 2000, Applicant sought advances against her salary from her employer because by playing slot machines she had lost the money she needed 
to pay bills. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant testified she only gambles at casinos a couple of times a year. However, in a statement she provided to a special agent from the Defense Security 
Service (DSS) in October 2002, she stated: "I currently gamble about $200.00 a month, if I have it" (GE 2). She testified the last time she went to a casino was 
a couple of months before the hearing and that she: ". . . spent about $500.00 and brought $3,200.00 home? [sic]" (Tr. p. 59). She visited a casino sometime 
between February and May 2005, and lost $300.00 (Tr. p. 59). The most she has lost at a casino in the last five years at one time is a thousand dollars (Tr. p. 
59). The most she has won at one time in the last five years is nine thousand dollars (Tr. p. 59).       </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's net pay every two weeks is approximately $700.00.<A HREF="03-01184.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> She also receives $1,228.00 per month from social security, and $110.00 per month from a 
pension (AE 1). She had $2,193.30 in a checking account as of October 31, 2005, and $1,295.94 split between two savings accounts as of November 1, 2005 
(AE 3). She also had $478.02 on deposit in a credit union account as of October 31, 2005 (AE 5). Applicant submitted verification she has been paying her rent, 
utilities, and car payment on time (AE 10). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's credit report, dated October 29, 2005 (AE 11), disclosed only the following accounts: 1) a revolving credit card with a high balance of $218.00 that 
was incurred in May and June 2005, paid in full as of July 2005, with the status listed as: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Open/Never late</EM>; 2) a revolving credit card closed as on August 1999, 
with the status listed as: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Paid, Closed/Never late</EM>; 3) a revolving credit card with a high balance of $514.00 that was paid in full as of June 2005, with the status 
listed as: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Open/Never late</EM>; and 4) an installment loan opened in July 2003 in the original amount of $11,055.00, with monthly payments in the amount of 
$215.00, a remaining balance as of  September 2005 in the amount of $6,627.00, and the status listed as: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Open/Never late</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant listed her bankruptcy and a 1978 felony arrest in a security clearance application (SF 86) she submitted in February 2001. However, she did not list 
the tax lien that was filed against her in March 1996. Applicant credibly testified that while she knew she had owed back taxes and had paid them, she didn't 
know that was considered a lien.    </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that potentially could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case are 
DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>; DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debt</EM>; and DC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Financial problems that are linked to gambling 
. . . . </EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was laid off and forced to work for substantially less pay in September 1991. She eventually found it necessary to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
protection in June 1995, and received a discharge in bankruptcy in October 1995. She allowed her son to use her credit card in about 1993, and as a result she 
incurred a debt in the amount of $4,412.00 which was charged off in October 1997. DC 1 and DC 3 both apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has not incurred any financial delinquencies since she obtained the bankruptcy discharge. The one delinquent account her son incurred on her behalf 
was charged off more than eight years ago. Applicant unsuccessfully attempted to dispute this account with the creditor. The creditor thereafter charged off the 
account in 1997, and  has not taken any subsequent action to collect on the account. Applicant's current credit report and the other exhibits she offered reveal 
she is living a financially responsible lifestyle that is well within her income level, and that she has remained current on all her debts for a number of years. 
itigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>; MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. 
loss of employment . . .)</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM> apply.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It is unlikely the SOR in this case would have been issued if it were not for the concern caused by Applicant's long history of gambling. Her physician referred 
her to a counselor about 15 years ago to discuss her gambling habit. Her sister recommended she attend gambler's anonymous meetings about 10 year ago. 
However, gambling in casinos is not illegal and in itself does not disqualify a person from holding a security clearance. The concern, at least as alleged under 
Guideline F, is financial problems that are incurred as a result of gambling.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On two occasions, once in 1999 and again in 2000, Applicant was forced to seek an advance in pay from her employer because she had gambled away money 
she needed to pay bills. However, there has been no recurrence of such irresponsible behavior since 2000. Instead, as Applicant wrote in the statement she 
provided to the DSS special agent she gambles "about $200 a month, if I have it" (GE 2). She testified she visits casinos and gambles several times a year, and 
the most she has lost in the past five years at one time is a thousand dollars. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The itemization of Applicant's monthly expenses and income (AE 1) indicates she lives well within her income and likely has significant discretionary income 
each month. Her credit history clearly indicates that whatever money she may lose in slot machines has no affect on her ability to stay current with her living 
expenses. Under the facts present in this case, Applicant's lifelong enjoyment in visiting casinos and playing slot machines does not create a security concern. 
DC 5 does not apply.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's explanation for not disclosing her 1996 tax lien in the 2001 SF 86 she submitted  is credible. In making that determination, I have carefully 
considered her appearance and demeanor while testifying, the substance of her testimony, the adverse information she did disclose in the SF 86, and her obvious 
lack of sophistication in such matters. She did not deliberately provide false information or fail to disclose accurate information when she submitted the SF 86. 
No disqualifying condition applies under Guideline E. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, including the testimony and evidence provided by Applicant, the whole 
person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns in this case. She has overcome the case against her and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline F and Guideline E 
are decided for Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
