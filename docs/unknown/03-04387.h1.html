<P>From 1976 until 1984, Applicant smoked marijuana and experimented with multiple other drugs as a high school and college student. After college, from 1984 
until 1997, he continued to smoke marijuana. During part of this time, he held a security clearance. He intentionally withheld the information related to his drug 
use when he completed his security clearance applications in 1990 and 2002. He did reveal his 1998 arrest for driving under the influence, but did not reveal 
that he was also charged with possession of marijuana. Applicant has mitigated the government's security concerns under Guidelines G and J, but has failed to 
overcome the security concerns as to Guidelines E and H. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On November 30, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Specifically, the SOR sets forth security concerns arising under Guideline E, Personal Conduct; Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption; Guideline H, Drug 
Involvement; and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, of the Directive. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
<P>On January 27, 2005, Applicant submitted his initial notarized response to the allegations. On June 24, 2005, through counsel, he submitted a supplemental 
notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing.</P> 
<P>This matter was assigned to another administrative judge on September 6, 2005, but reassigned to me on September 13, 2005 because of caseload 
considerations. A notice of hearing was issued on September 26, 2005, and a hearing was held on October 14, 2005. The government filed a Motion in Limine 
opposing the use of polygraph testing results as evidence, and the testimony of a polygraph expert. Applicant filed a response motion. Based on the decision of 
the Appeal Board in <EM>ISCR Case No. 96-0785</EM> (App. Bd. Sept. 3,1998)<EM>, </EM>the government's motion was denied, the evidence was admitted, and the evidence would 
be weighed. Eleven government exhibits and four Applicant Exhibits were admitted into evidence.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Two additional Government Exhibits were admitted for 
administrative notice. Applicant testified. Two experts also testified on his behalf. Following a brief voir dire, the government stipulated to the expertise of the 
polygraph expert.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The government did not object to the qualifications of the second expert.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on October 28, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all the allegations of the SOR.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Those admissions are incorporated here as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the

<P>In 1987, the police arrested Applicant and charged him with possession of a controlled substance (marijuana), a misdemeanor offense.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> He pled not guilty.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> 
The court found him guilty and fined him $100.00.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In 1990, Applicant completed a security clearance application, wherein he listed his 1987 arrest,<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> and signed a statement.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> In his signed statement, he 
acknowledged smoking, and occasionally purchasing, marijuana from 1978 to 1984 due to peer pressure.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> He then stated he quit smoking marijuana in 1984.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> 
He also admitted purchasing and using cocaine while a student, but not to the use of other illegal drugs.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> Finally, he stated he did not intend to use any illegal 
drugs in the future.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> Subsequent to completing this statement, he received a security clearance in 1991.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In January 1998, Applicant and his young sons attended a super bowl party at the home of a friend.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> During this time, he drank alcohol. He also observed a 
small bag on the floor.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> He picked up the bag and put it in his pocket.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> Before the party ended, his then wife called from the airport and asked that he drive to 
the airport and pick her up.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> He told her he had been drinking and did not believe he should drive.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> She became very upset, and started making threats related 
to their impending divorce.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> He drove to the airport, and parked in a no parking zone.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> The police arrived, conducted a sobriety field test, and searched him.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> 
They found the bag in his pocket, and concluded that it may contain marijuana.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> They then arrested him for driving under the influence (DUI) and charged him 
with DUI and unlawful possession of marijuana.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> The court found him guilty of DUI, and dismissed the possession of marijuana charge.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> The court sentenced 
him to two days in jail, fined him $400.00, and placed him on one year probation.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> He has not used marijuana since 1997, and has stated that he does not intend

possession of marijuana or the additional charge for possession of marijuana in 1998.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> He failed to acknowledge his previous illegal drug use while a student 
and his use of marijuana after he had received a security clearance.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> Instead, he answered "no" to questions 27 and 28.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> Subsequent to completing his security 
clearance application, he completed three sworn statements.<A HREF="03-04387.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> In the first sworn statement, he stated he had not used any illegal drugs since 1984, while a
