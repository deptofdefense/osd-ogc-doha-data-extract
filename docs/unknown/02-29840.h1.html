<P>Security concerns were raised regarding a 29-year-old Vietnam-born naturalized U.S. citizen Applicant--who managed to flee the Socialist Republic of 
Vietnam (SRVN) in 1979--whose four sisters remain citizens and residents of SRVN, and whose mother--a permanent U.S. alien--is a citizen of SRVN who 
resides part-time in the U.S. and in SRVN.  None of them are agents of SRVN or in a position to be exploited by that government.  Applicant's brother and 
other sister are naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S.  The security concerns are mitigated by the evidence developed herein.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On November 7, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated November 17, 2003, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to, and 
received by, me on March 30, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued that same day scheduling the hearing for April 22, 2004.  It was held as scheduled.  During 
the hearing, two government exhibits and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 4, 
2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>During the proceeding, under Rule 201(b)(2), Federal Rules of Evidence, Department Counsel requested that official notice be taken of certain adjudicative 
facts as set forth in a document furnished for consideration.  There being no objection by Applicant, I took official notice of the U.S. Department of State, 
Bureau of Consular Affairs, <EM>Consular Information Sheet: Vietnam</EM>, dated January 13, 2004, consisting of 10 pages.  Also, Department Counsel moved to amend 
subparagraph 1.a of the SOR.  Specifically, she sought to amend subparagraph 1.a. thereof, to conform to the evidence and correct a typing error, by deleting the 
word "father," from the first line of the sentence and substituting therefor the word "mother."  There being no objection by Applicant, I granted the motion.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted all of the three factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.).  Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance the level of which has not been divulged.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant was born in 1975 in what was then the Republic of Vietnam (RVN).<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He resided with his parents and six siblings--a brother and five sisters.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In 
1979, four years after the collapse of RVN, Applicant, his brother, oldest sister, aunt, and some cousins, fled RVN by boat.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  They spent an unspecified period 
of time in a refugee camp in Singapore<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> before being sponsored for entry into the United States by an uncle and aunt who were already U.S. citizens and 
residents.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant attended a high school in the U.S.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and subsequently a state university where, in December 2000, he was granted a degree in 
information technology.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 1995.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He renounced his Vietnamese citizenship when he became a naturalized citizen of the United 
States and pledged his loyalty to protect and defend the interests of the U.S.  Applicant is not a dual citizen and considers himself to be a citizen of only the 
U.S.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  The government has offered no evidence to rebut Applicant's contention, and I accept it as fact.</P> 
 
<P>The citizenship and residency status of Applicant's immediate family is as follows: Applicant's father--formerly a soy sauce maker<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>--is deceased, having 
passed away in about 1989-90 while residing in SRVN.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  His mother--born in 1940<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> and the owner of the soy sauce business<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>--and unable to leave 
SRVN until about 2001-02,<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> is a citizen of SRVN who splits her residency.  During the summer months, she resides with either Applicant or two of his 
siblings in the U.S.,<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and during the winter months she returns to SRVN to reside with one daughter<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> while tending to her business.  Applicant's mother is a 
U.S. registered alien<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> who has not yet taken steps to obtain a U.S. citizenship.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Applicant's brother--born in 1966<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> and an information systems 
consultant<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>--is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the U.S. with his wife.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Applicant's oldest sister--born in 1964<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> and the sister who accompanied him 
eventually to the U.S. from RVN--is a housewife married to a U.S. citizen and she too is a naturalized U.S. citizen residing in the U.S.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>When Applicant fled RVN, he left four sisters behind.  They are all citizens of SRVN.  Applicant's brother has spent the past 10 years completing the necessary 
paperwork in an effort to sponsor their immigration to the U.S.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  One sister--born about 35 years ago--resides with her husband and child.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  They are in the 
shrimp business and have no connection with the government of SRVN.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  Applicant  rarely communicates with them, but may do so by Internet instant 
messenger about two times per year.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  Another sister--born about 33 years ago--resides with her husband and child.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  They, too, are in the shrimp business 
and have no connection with the government of SRVN.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  Applicant rarely communicates with this sister because she is rather shy, but he does communicate 
with her husband by Internet instant messenger about one time per month.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  Another sister--born about 28 years ago--resides with her husband.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  They, too, 
are in the shrimp business and have no connection with the government of SRVN.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A>  Applicant rarely communicates with them, but may do so by Internet 
instant messenger about two times per year.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  Applicant's youngest sister--born about 26 years ago--is unmarried.  She is an accountant with a U.S. company 
and starting in the shrimp business.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  Applicant regularly communicates with her by Internet instant messenger on a monthly basis.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>  Although Applicant 
tries to be close to his four sisters, he regrets that they are not because they rarely communicate with each other.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant does not give financial support to his four sisters.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  However, on the occasions of his visits to SRVN he has offered them $200.00-$300.00 which 
they sometimes accept.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Since he fled SRVN in 1979, Applicant has returned there to visit his family on several occasions.  He went there during the summers of 1993 and 1996, as well 
as in May 2000.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A>  Since receiving his college degree, he has returned two times each year in 2002, 2003, was there one time so far earlier this year.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A>  During 
his most recent trips he generally resides with his mother in her house.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant does not have any foreign investments or financial interests, including bank accounts or land, in SRVN.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A>  While he does not yet own a residence or 
car in the U.S., he is currently co-signing a note with his cousin to purchase a mobile home.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A>  His future goals are to advance in his career, get married, and 
raise a family in the U.S.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been employed by the same government contractor since November 2000 where he now serves as an infrastructure associate.<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A>  The quality of 
his work performance has not been developed.</P> 
 
<P>The government of RVN collapsed in 1975, coinciding with the establishment of the Communist SRVN.  Full diplomatic relations were established between 
the U.S. and SRVN in 1995, and, in 2001, a bilateral trade agreement between the two countries finally commenced.  Under that agreement, <EM>temporary</EM>--later 
modified to <EM>conditional</EM>--normal trade relations (formerly known as most-favored nation status) were extended by the U.S.  SRVN has also given the U.S. 
modest support in the war against terrorism.  While SRVN has a Communist totalitarian government which seemingly encourages technology transfers from the 
Vietnamese expatriate intellectuals abroad, the Department Counsel has offered no evidence to indicate SRVN conducts intelligence operations or economic 
espionage against the United States.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded that both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government 
meets its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient 
to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
the applicant's clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the government must 
be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P>One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to 
the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness testimony, demeanor, and credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal 
precepts and factors, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because members of his 
immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, four of his five sisters are citizens and residents of 
SRVN and his mother is a citizen of SRVN--are either not citizens or residents of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations raise the 
potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:<A HREF="02-29840.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.</P> 
 
<P>The citizenship status of Applicant's four sisters and mother, when considered in light of the nature of the government in SRVN--a Communist totalitarian 
country that is no longer involved in open military hostilities with the United States, and whose interests are not necessarily inimical to the United States, and 
currently is engaged in normal trade relations with the U.S.--facilitates an analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions 
set forth therein.  Applicant's brother and one of his five sisters are already naturalized U.S. citizens, and only the continuing SRVN citizenship of his mother 
and the citizenship and residency of his other four sisters raise the issue of potential foreign influence.  These facts activate Foreign Influence Disqualifying 
Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>However, also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position 
to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>).  After an 
examination of the evidence, I determine that Applicant's mother and four sisters, considering their citizenship and residency status, do not constitute an 
unacceptable security risk.  His mother has been a permanent resident alien of the U.S. since 2001-02 and, while she may return to SRVN during the winter 
months, she routinely returns to her permanent residence in the U.S. where she has three children residing, all of whom are already naturalized U.S. citizens.  
Considering her age and part-time occupation, she appears to be a risk to noone.  Likewise, considering the occupations of his four sisters in SRVN, as well as 
their intentions to immigrate with their brother's assistance, they appear to be a risk to noone as well.</P> 
 
<P>Furthermore, Applicant's absence of foreign investments or financial interests, including bank accounts or land, in SRVN, raises FI MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (<EM>foreign 
financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case with respect to 
Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is suitable for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>

<P>Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:</P> 
 
<P>Paragraph 1. Guideline B:  FOR THE APPLICANT</P>
