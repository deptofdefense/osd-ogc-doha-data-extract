<P>Applicant incurred financial problems after being laid off from her employment in 1998. She was unable to find employment with the same pay and benefits 
and she ended up liable for payments on two vehicles for which she co-signed loans-one for her daughter and one for her son's girlfriend. Although she has 
made some effort to pay off her debts, she still owes more than she will be able to repay in the near future and has no plan in place to do so. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 4 January 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="04-01670.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive. 
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 18 January 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 27 
June 2005. On 16 August 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 23August 2005. I kept the record open and Applicant submitted Exs. D, E, and F. As 
Department Counsel had no objection, the exhibits were admitted into evidence.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 55-year-old security and protective services officer for a defense contractor. She is separated from her second husband. She has three children by 
her first husband. They are 34, 32 and 22 years old. </P> 
<P>Applicant formerly worked for an electronics firm. After working there for more than 16 years, she was laid off in 1998. Her inability to get a job paying the 
same amount caused her some financial difficulties. She worked at several different jobs before finding her current position. Recently she has been unable to 
work a second job because she had to take care of her father who was dying. He passed away a week before the hearing. Tr. 9-10.</P> 
<P>Her two largest debts were the result of co-signing automobile loans for her daughter and her son's girlfriend. Her daughter's car was repossessed for non-payment and Applicant incurred a debt of more than $3,700 that has not been paid. After her son's girlfriend got her car, she dumped the son. Applicant has not 
been able to find her. Applicant owes more than $17,000 on the car. Although there is evidence someone else may be using her Social Security Account 
Number (Tr.12; Ex. C), Applicant admits the debts alleged in the SOR are hers. Tr. 16.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had four debts in collection status totaling more than $2,300 (&para;&para; 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h), three charged off accounts totaling 
more than $21,000 (&para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, 1.f); and was past due on her mortgage (&para; 1.e). She admitted each of the allegations contained in the SOR. An applicant who is 
financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established each of the allegations in the SOR and potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has a history of not 
meeting her financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is unable to satisfy her debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> As the evidence established potentially disqualifying 
conditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive &para; E3.1.15. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence established Applicant is making a concerted effort to pay off her debts. MC E2.A6.1.3.6. She has received counseling and is trying to resolve her 
financial problems. MC E2.A6.1.3.4. The debts were in large measure beyond her control-they started when she was laid off from her job in 1998. MC 
E2.A6.1.3.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nevertheless, despite her attempts to pay off these debts, there is no likelihood she will be able to do so in the near future. Although she lives 
frugally, her debts are overwhelming when compared to her meager income and she has no definite plans in place to pay the remaining delinquent debts. Under 
the circumstances, I find against Applicant on &para; 1, except for those debts she has paid.</SPAN></P>
