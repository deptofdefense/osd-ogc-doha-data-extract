<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On September 23, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 7, 2006, after the 
hearing,  Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; 
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is arbitrary, capricious 
or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge's adverse clearance decision should be reversed because the Applicant did not deliberately or intentionally make 
false statements in  response to three questions on his Security Clearance Application (SOR paragraphs 1.a through 1.c).  It is Applicant's contention that his 
omission of three felony charges, one Driving Under the Influence charge, and one failure to appear charge, occurred because he had forgotten about the 
incidents and misinterpreted the questions.  Applicant also argues that his inconsistent explanations at the hearing<A HREF="04-09488.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> were due to the stress that was imposed 
upon him in preparing a case for a security clearance that he was looking forward to receiving.  The Board does not find Applicant's arguments persuasive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his Security Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not 
binding on the Administrative Judge. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at 6-7 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003). As the trier of fact, the Judge had to consider 
Applicant's statements in light of the record evidence as a whole, and Applicant's denial of any intent to provide false information did not preclude the Judge 
from weighing the record evidence and making  findings that contradicted Applicant's denials. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Reviewing the Administrative Judge's conclusions regarding SOR paragraph 1.d, the Board is unable to discern whether the Judge found for Applicant or 
against him on this portion of the SOR.  Furthermore, the Judge failed to make a formal finding with respect to SOR paragraph 1.d.  The Judge's failure to 
make findings and reach conclusions with respect to SOR paragraph 1.d was error under Directive &para; E3.1.25.  However, considering the other sustainable 
adverse formal findings, the Judge's error in this aspect of the case is harmless.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-07757 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2004).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the 
particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance 
decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>vice versa</EM>.  An applicant's disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not 
sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible 
application of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors. The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating 
conditions or whole person factors with respect to the Guideline E and J allegations, and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had 
presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  Given the record </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">that was before him, the Judge's ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is not arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</SPAN></P>
