  Department Counsel's establishment of a prima facie case against Applicant did not preclude the possibility that Applicant could present credible evidence that rebutted or overcame the evidence against him.  Given the totality of the record evidence in this case, including third-party testimony that corroborated Applicant's  testimony, the Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant did not misappropriate company computers in December 2001 is sustainable.  Given the totality of the record  evidence, the Judge's conclusions about Applicant's judgment reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence and are not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to  law.  Favorable decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated November 10, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative Judge Roger 
E. Willmeth issued a favorable security clearance decision dated April 26, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel appealed the Administrative Judge's favorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant did not misappropriate company computers in 
December 2001; and (2) in the alternative, even if the Board concludes the first claim of error is not persuasive, whether the Administrative Judge erred because the 
record evidence shows Applicant lacked judgment because he did not act to resolve questions in his own mind about whether he had misappropriated company 
computers in December 2001.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual or legal 
error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed 
factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why 
party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the 
Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational 
connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect 
of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of 
opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary 
to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state 
or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article 
VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported by such 
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The 
Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the 
evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility 
determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal 
cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 
99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and 
E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant did not misappropriate company computers in December 2001</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that 
Applicant had presented credible evidence that rebutted and refuted the record evidence presented by Department Counsel in support of the SOR allegation that 
Applicant had misappropriated company computers in December 2001, and found that Applicant did not in fact misappropriate company computers.  On appeal, 
Department Counsel challenges that finding.</P> 
 
<P>Given Applicant's answer to the SOR and the Government Exhibits, Department Counsel met its burden of presenting a sufficient case in support of the SOR allegation 
such that the burden of persuasion shifted to Applicant.  Under Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.15, Applicant had the burden to present credible 
evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation of his conduct.  Considering the totality of the record evidence in this case (including testimony by third parties 
that corroborated Applicant's explanation about the circumstances surrounding his handling of the company computers in December 2001), it was not arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant presented credible evidence of refutation and explanation that satisfied his burden of 
persuasion under Item E3.1.15.  The Judge's finding that Applicant did not misappropriate company computers is sustainable under Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel's arguments to the contrary are not persuasive.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (June 9, 2004) at p. 5 
(Department Counsel's establishment of a <EM>prima facie</EM> case does not foreclose the possibility that an applicant could present credible evidence that rebuts or negates the 
evidence presented against the applicant).</P> 
 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">In the alternative, even if the Board concludes the first claim of error is not persuasive, whether the Administrative Judge erred because the record evidence shows 
Applicant lacked judgment because he did not act to resolve questions in his own mind about whether he had misappropriated company computers in December 2001</SPAN>.  
Department Counsel contends, in the alternative, that the Board should conclude the Administrative Judge erred even if it sustains his finding that Applicant did not 
misappropriate company computers in December 2001.  In support of this contention, Department Counsel argues that the record evidence shows that Applicant lacked 
judgment because he did not act to resolve questions in his own mind about whether he had misappropriated company computers, and that this lack of judgment raised 
sufficient security concerns under Guideline E to preclude a favorable security clearance decision.</P> 
 
<P>Given the totality of the record evidence in this case, Department Counsel's arguments fail to persuade the Board that the Administrative Judge's favorable conclusions 
about Applicant's judgment are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Applicant persuasively argues that the Judge's conclusions reflect a reasonable interpretation of 
the totality of the record evidence (which included third-party corroboration of Applicant's testimony) about the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant's handling 
of company computers in December 2001</P>

<P>Department Counsel has failed to demonstrate error below.  Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision.</P>
