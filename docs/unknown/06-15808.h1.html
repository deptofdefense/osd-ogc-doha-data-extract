<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Forty-two-year-old Applicant had five alleged debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR). </SPAN> She successfully disputed two SOR debts.  Two SOR debts are being resolved with payment plans.  
The creditor for one SOR debt that was beyond the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations for debts was unreasonable about arranging a payment plan. For the last three years she lived within

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) refers to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, and DoD Directive 
5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of 
Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the Directive to resolve 
contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case, the pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the same.  Paragraph C8.2.1 of 
the Regulation provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor personnel.  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 16, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On August 16, 2006, DOHA issued a SOR 
to her, pursuant to the Directive and the Regulation.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that 
Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, received at DOHA on September 15, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 2006, the case 
was assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 29, 2006.  At the hearing I approved Applicant's request that I hold the record open so she could submit additional documentary evidence 
(R. 49-50, 63).  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on December 18, 2006.  Department Counsel had no objection to my consideration of the evidence Applicant provided, and I admitted 
her additional evidence (Ex. U) on January 9, 2007.    </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the debts listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b and 1.c.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  For these three accounts she promised to negotiate a 
payment plan in the next month.  She said the debt in SOR &para; 1.d was not her account and provided a letter from the creditor that she did not have a current account with the creditor (Ex. 6 at 27).  
For the debt in SOR &para; 1.e, she indicated there were unauthorized charges to her account.  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:           </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 42 years old.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  For the last ten years, she has been employed by a United States government contractor, and she is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  She has no 
prior military service.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She attended a technical college for three years, and received two, 2-year degrees.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant began financial counseling on December 18, 2006 (Ex. U at 13).  Her credit counselor reviewed Applicant's debts.  <EM>Id.</EM> They discussed how to settle her debts, possible  payment plans and 
other legal methods of debt resolution.  <EM>Id</EM>.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant has never been married, and has one child (born in 1986).<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She is a single parent (R. 31).  Her daughter has taken a month off from college and currently lives at home (R. 46). Her 
daughter's father did not consistently pay his child support payments of $160 per month, even though she garnished his wages on several occasions (R. 31-32).  She obtained his federal tax refund 
of several thousand dollars in 2001 or 2002 from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) (R. 32-33).  However, after the IRS determined he had not withheld sufficient income to pay his taxes, she 
returned the money to the IRS (R. 32-33). </P> 
 
<P> A friend who lived in her residence wanted to buy a truck, and Applicant co-signed for his vehicle loan (R. 33-34).  He failed to make payments as agreed (R. 33-34).  She "kicked him out" of her 
residence (R. 57; Ex. T).  In 2002, she returned the vehicle to the dealership, and they sold it at auction, resulting in the deficiency of $5,176 alleged in SOR &para; 1.a (R. 35).  The creditor obtained a 
judgment in February 2005 (R. 35).  The interest rate was 25.5 percent per year (R. 33).  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's personal financial statement (PFS) prepared in 2005<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> indicated her gross salary is $2,225 per month, and her deductions are $580 per month.  She listed monthly household expenses as 
follows: lot rent ($180), groceries ($300), clothing ($0), utilities ($500), car expenses ($300), and insurance ($0).  She listed a mortgage payment of $256, and a student loan payment of $50.  She 
did not list payments to any of the SOR creditors.  After deducting all expenses, she had a positive cash flow of about $60 per month.  In 2006 after completing her PFS, her net income increased to 
about $1750 per month; her lot rent increased to $190 per month (R. 46); her mortgage on her mobile home is paid (R. 47-48).  She does not have an active credit card and pays for all purchases 
with cash (R. 36).  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative </SPAN>judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national 
security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence 
in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to 
classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness 
determinations for ADP positions.  Ultimately, in the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal 
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The 
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information. 
Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  Applicant established that she is not responsible for the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.d and 1.e, and they were removed from her credit 
report.  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.d and 1.e are not substantiated.  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.c became delinquent between 2002 and 2004.  They have been delinquent for at least three years.    </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failure to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.c (totaling $8,545), which then became delinquent 
and remained delinquent. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating 
condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation);" FC MC 4, "the person has received or 
is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> I conclude FC 
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had three valid, delinquent SOR debts at the time the SOR was issued.  Initiation of payment plans for the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.c in November 
and December 2006, well after she received the SOR is simply too recent to merit application of FC MC 1. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to the SOR debts in &para;&para; 1.a to 1.c because these three debts became delinquent in part because her daughter's father failed to pay his child support when due, causing 
financial problems that may be "largely beyond the person's control." Applicant, however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she waited until November and December 2006 to begin 
making  payments on the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.c, and she has not provided her plan to resolve debt in SOR &para; 1.b.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how she endeavored to pay or resolve 
her SOR debts over the last two years, and she has not established a connection from the lack of child support after her daughter reached 18 years of age (two years ago) to her delinquent debts.  
However, her recent initiation of a payment plan for the SOR debt in &para; 1.c, even though it is not collectible because of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations warrants some credit, which 
will be applied in the whole person analysis, <EM>infra</EM>.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  Based on the sincerity of her testimony, and the other record indicia of improved financial knowledge (through counseling) and self-discipline, 
I am confident that she is on the right track now towards maintenance of her finances. </P> 
 
<P>She received financial counseling, and receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there are clear indications (especially since December 2006) that the problem is being resolved and under 
control.  In regard to application of the statute of limitations, FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her 
debts.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  S.C. Code. Ann. &sect; 15-3-530 lists the statute of limitations for various debts, including those in SOR &para;&para; 1.b and 1.c.<A HREF="06-15808.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  In <EM>Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v.

132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is currently 
42 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> 
<SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her inability to repay her debts resulted in part from the failure of her daughter's father to pay his child support. 
There is some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the complete absence of new delinquent, unpaid debt over the 
last three years (the judgment in SOR &para; 1.a resulted from a debt that became delinquent in 2002).  Moreover, potential increased income though annual raises shows signs of financial improvement 
in the future. </SPAN>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low.  Applicant has no car or mortgage payments. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN>She began making payments on the debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a and 1.c, and 
paid these creditors a total of $475 in November and December 2006.  She is negotiating in good faith with the creditor for the debt in SOR &para; 1.b. However, if negotiations are unsuccessful with the 
creditor for the debt in SOR &para; 1.b, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">she has no legal liability because of the applicability of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations.  Greater awareness of financial responsibilities from her 
counseling will result in a continuously improving trend of financial circumstances. Moreover, stability in her employment, increases in her income, and reduction in her debt load should increase 
her net worth and establish a financial foundation for her future.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In ISCR Case No. 04-07360 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006), the Board noted that two SOR debts were paid through judgment and garnishment, one SOR debt was paid through settlement, and one SOR 
debt was never paid.  Indeed, for one SOR debt the applicant did not even contact the creditor about payment.  Nevertheless, the applicant showed that he reduced his overall debt by 95% and the 
Board affirmed the decision to grant that applicant a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial case is similar to ISCR Case No. 04-07360.  She has three valid SOR debts. One the three SOR debts is barred by the South Carolina's 3-year statute of limitations.  She is 
making payments on the other two SOR debts.  As such, the concern about current financial pressure that may result in illegal activity is significantly lower because she no longer has any delinquent 
debts.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has </SPAN>mitigated the trustworthiness concerns
