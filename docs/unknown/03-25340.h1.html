<P>Applicant is employed by a defense contractor in a position requiring a security clearance. His duties include monitoring and installing electronic security

<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On May 16, 2005, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="03-25340.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="03-25340.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), Guideline K (Security Violations), Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), and Guideline M (Misuse of Information 
Technology Systems) of the Directive.  On June 1, 2005, Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR and elected to have a hearing before an administrative 
judge.  The case was assigned to me July 7, 2003.  Applicant waived the fifteen day notification provision of &para; E3.1.8. of the Directive. (Tr. 5-6; 8-10)  On 
October 7, 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced 13 exhibits, which were identified and numbered Ex. 1 through 13.  Applicant called one 
witness and introduced one exhibit, which was identified as Ex. A.  All  exhibits were admitted to the record without objection.  DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) of the proceeding on October 18, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR in this case contains seven allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct; one allegation under Guideline K, Security 
Violations; four allegations under Guideline D, Sexual Behavior; and one allegation under Guideline M, Misuse of Information Technology Systems.  In his 
answer to the SOR Applicant admitted twelve of the thirteen allegations.  He denied as exaggerated the SOR allegation that he had 10 extra-marital affairs 
while traveling outside of the U.S. on official business from December 1996 to at least June 2004, and that his wife was unaware of five or six of the affairs.  
Applicant admitted about six or seven extra-marital affairs between December 1996 and at least June 2004, and he told his wife about them when he was 
preparing his answer to the SOR. (Tr. 63-64.)  Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 57 years old.  His general area of expertise is electronics, and he is employed by a government contractor to monitor and install security equipment 
in U.S. embassies.  He has held a security clearance since 1968.  He served in the Armed Forces for 24 years and was honorably discharged in 1993.  (Tr. 109;  
Ex. A)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, were married in 1981.  They are the parents of a child born in 1981.  In 1995, Applicant and his wife were 
divorced.  They remarried in 1996.  (Exs. 1, 2, 3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1993, Applicant began working for federal contractors. (Exs. 1, 2, 3.)  In 1997, while employed by a federal contractor, he inserted an un-scanned disk into 
his computer in violation of the policies and procedures of the federal agency to which he had been assigned by his employer.  The disk was contaminated with 
a computer virus.  Applicant was verbally reprimanded by his supervisor and issued a letter of caution about his action.  He was subsequently transferred to 
another contract.  (Ex. 6; Tr. 28-31.)  Applicant defended his conduct by observing that  others in his office also failed to scan their disks before inserting them 
into the Government computers. (Tr. 28-31.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2000, Applicant was fired from a job (Job 1) for unprofessional conduct in the workplace.  Applicant's unprofessional conduct involved two angry 
verbal outbursts against coworkers and one incident where he purposely knocked a soda can out of a coworker's hand.  ( Tr. 31-34; Ex. 7; Ex. 8.)  The 
information about Applicant's unprofessional conduct was provided by co-workers and associates.  (Ex. 7.)  Applicant denied being a hostile person.  
Applicant's witness was the target of one of his outbursts but said he was not bothered by it. (Ex. 7; Tr. 91; 94-95.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On about May 1, 2002, Applicant was fired from a job (Job 2) as a contract employee because he used a government computer at the federal agency where he 
was assigned to access an on-line dating service and arrange a date in a Middle-Eastern country where he was assigned on official government business.  
Applicant's employer fired him because his dating inquiry telegraphed his travel to and work assignment in the country and had the potential to put him and his 
coworkers at risk.  (Ex. 4, at 1-2; Tr. 50-52.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After being fired the second time, Applicant sought employment in May 2002 with another government contractor ( Job 3).  The job he applied for required a 
security clearance.  (Tr. 47.)  On his employment application, Applicant failed to list the reasons for his terminations from Job 1 and Job 2.  He said he released 
from Job 2 as the result of  "cut backs" and from Job 1 as the result of a "lost contract."  (Ex. 13 at 3.)  Applicant falsified his job application because he feared 
he would not get the job if he told the truth.  (Tr. 40-41.)  He was hired by the government contractor, and, as a new employee, he was provided with the 
company's policy and procedures regarding sexual harassment complaints.  He acknowledged receipt of the company's policy and procedures regarding sexual 
harassment complaints on June 6, 2002.  (Ex. 10.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2002, while employed at Job 3, Applicant inappropriately touched a female employee, who complained to management.  On December 17, 2002, 
Applicant's employer issued him a letter of warning about his inappropriate behavior.  (Ex. 9.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2004, while employed at Job 3, Applicant again used a government computer at his federal work site to access an on-line dating service.  He visited the on-line dating service because he saw other employees doing so.  His employer learned of this conduct and verbally counseled Applicant and the other employees 
not to visit dating service sites while at work.  (Ex.5 at 3; Tr. 53-55.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between December 1996 and June 2004, Applicant's jobs required that he travel outside of the U.S. on official business.  He was often assigned to work in 
foreign countries for several weeks at a time.  On June 4, 2004, in a signed, sworn statement made to a special agent of the Defense Security Service, Applicant 
stated: "Since my wife and I re-married in 1996, I have had about ten extramarital affairs, having sex with other women." (Ex. 5 at 4.)  Applicant also stated his 
wife knew of "about four or five" of the affairs, but he had not told her of the others because he wanted to avoid arguments with her.  The extra-marital contacts 
occurred outside of the U.S. when Applicant was assigned by his employer to official business.  He did not inform his security officer of his affairs because he 
did not think the countries in which they occurred were hostile to the U.S. (Ex 5 at 4.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR Applicant did not deny having extra-marital affairs but disputed his earlier statement to the special agent that he had engaged in 10 
such affairs.  At his hearing he admitted having "about six or seven." (Tr. 63-64.)  Some of the women were foreign nationals working in U.S. embassies.  
Others he met in malls, restaurants, or on the Internet.  He still has contact with a woman in a Middle-Eastern country.  Since he gave his statement to the 
special agent in June 2004, Applicant has had a sexual relationship with a woman in an Asian country.  She was an employee of a European embassy located in 
an Asian country. (Tr. 64-77)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 9, 2001, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86) as a part of a periodic five-year review of his security worthiness.  He signed 
and certified his answers to the SF-86 as true, complete, and correct.  Question 20 on the SF-86 asks whether, in the previous seven years, an applicant has been 
fired from a job, quit a job after being told he'd be fired, left a job by mutual consent following allegations of misconduct, left a job by mutual agreement 
following allegations of unsatisfactory performance, or let a job for another reason under unfavorable circumstances.  Applicant responded "no" to Question 20. 
(Ex. 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 31, 2004, Applicant completed and certified as correct a second SF-86.  In response to Question 20, Applicant answered "yes" and said he was fired 
from Job 2 for using a government computer to visit a dating service.  Applicant used the on-line dating service to request a female companion to show him 
around a Middle Eastern country where he been assigned by his employer.  Applicant further explained his employer fired him because his solicitation raised 
security concerns.  (Ex. 3)  Applicant did not admit he had been fired from Job 1 in March 2000.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In 
evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline E that Applicant falsified material facts on a SF-86 he executed on August 9, 2001 when he answered "no" to 
Question 20 and deliberately failed to disclose he had been fired from a job (&para; 1.a.); that on March 7, 2000, he had been fired from a job for unprofessional 
behavior in the workplace (&para; 1.b.); that on May 1, 2002, he had been fired from a job for using a government computer to access the Internet to visit a dating 
service web site, where he gave notice of his assignment to a Middle Eastern country, thereby publicizing his future official government travel and putting his 
work team at risk (&para; 1.c.); and that he falsified material facts on an employment application on May 21, 2002, when he listed "cut backs" as the reason he was 
terminated from Job 2 and "lost contract" as the reason he was terminated from Job 1, as described in &para;&para; 1.b. and 1.c. above (&para; 1.d.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA further alleged under Guideline E that Applicant falsified material facts on the SF-86 he executed March 31, 2004, by responding to Question 20 by 
answering "yes" and then listing that he had been fired from Job 2 but deliberately failing to disclose he had been fired also from Job 1 (&para;1.e.); that he had been 
verbally counseled in early 2004 for using official U.S. government computers, while on duty, to look at photographs of an on-line dating service (&para; 1.f.); and 
for the information set forth in &para;&para; 2.a., 3.a., 3.b., and 3.c. of the SOR (&para; 1.g.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E conduct raises security concerns because it involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; 
E2.A5.l.l. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct raises security concerns under four Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline E.  First, reliable, unfavorable information about 
Applicant's unprofessional conduct and questionable judgment was provided by coworkers and associates, raising a concern under DC E2.A5.1.2.1 of the 
Guideline.  Second, Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on two security clearance applications and a job application, raising a security concern under 
DC E2.A5.1.2.2. of the Guideline.  Third, Applicant's inappropriate touching of a female coworker and his multiple, unreported sexual affairs while on official 
duty overseas raise security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.4 of Guideline E because they could make him vulnerable to blackmail and make him vulnerable to 
coercion, exploitation or duress.  Fourth, Applicant's use of the of a government computer, while on official duty, to access an on-line dating service and his 
failure to follow  established policies and procedures for handling secure information stored on computer disks raise security concerns under DC E2.A5.1.2.5., 
for they suggest a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the conduct which gave rise to the Guideline E security concerns identified in the SOR.  Through Applicant's own admissions, the 
Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that Applicant's Guideline E conduct disqualifies him from being entrusted with classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">We turn to an examination of possible Mitigating Conditions (MC) under the Guideline.  Because Applicant's coworkers and associates provided information 
about his unprofessional conduct that was substantiated and pertinent to a determination of his judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability, MC E2.A5.1.3.1 is 
inapplicable.  Neither MC E2.A5.1.3.2. nor MC E2.A5.1.3.3 apply to Applicant's case because his falsifications of his SF-86s and his employment application 
were recent, not isolated incidents, and were not corrected voluntarily by prompt, good-faith efforts to set the record straight before being confronted with the 
facts.  Applicant asserted he was not candid about being fired from two jobs because he feared he would not be hired if he told the truth.  Applicant's reticence 
to reveal the truth about his conduct suggests that, in some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government.  The capacity to be truthful 
goes to the essence of an individual's security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because Applicant continued the sexual conduct that made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, MC E2.A5.1.3.5. is also inapplicable.  None of 
the other mitigating conditions under Guideline E apply to the facts of Applicant's case.  Accordingly, the Guideline E allegations of the SOR are concluded 
against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline K -Security Violations</STRONG>   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR DOHA alleged under Guideline K of the Directive that Applicant failed to comply with security regulations when he neglected to have a disk 
scanned before inserting it into his Government computer.  The disk was infected with a virus  which, in turn, infected his computer on March 6, 1997, in 
violation of the policy and procedure of the federal agency where he was assigned.  Applicant's failure to have the disk scanned  resulted in a verbal reprimand 
from his employer and transfer to another contract  (2.a.)  Under Guideline K, noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's 
trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.  E2.A11.1.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's deliberate and negligent conduct raises security concerns under Disqualifying</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Condition (DC) E2.A11.1.2.2. of Guideline K.  Applicant's conduct was infrequent, making Mitigating condition (MC) E2.A.11.1.3.2 applicable.  However, his 
conduct was deliberate and not the consequence of improper or inadequate training.  Thus, MC E2.A11.1.3.1 and E2.A.11.1.3.3 are not applicable.  Applicant 
failed to demonstrate a positive attitude towards the discharge of his security responsibilities.  Accordingly, MC E2.A.11.1.3.4. is also inapplicable.  The 
Guideline K allegation of the SOR is concluded against the Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline D - Sexual Behavior</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR DOHA alleged under Guideline D of the Directive that Applicant touched a female coworker inappropriately on or about December 16, 2002, 
resulting in a written warning from his employer on December 17, 2002 (&para; 3.a.); that from December 3, 1996, to at least June 4, 2004, and while he was 
married, Applicant engaged in approximately 10 sexual affairs while traveling on official business outside the U.S; that his wife was unaware of approximately 
five or six of the affairs and Applicant did not want her to know about them (&para;3.b.);.that Applicant did not report any of these extra-marital affairs with foreign 
nationals to his security officer (&para; 3.c.); and that, as alleged in &para; 1.f. of the SOR, he was verbally counseled in early 2004 for using official U.S. government 
computers, while on duty, to look at photos of an on-line dating serviced (&para; 3.d.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to coercion, 
exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  E2.A4.1.1. Applicant's conduct raises security concerns under two Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) under  Guideline D.  First, Applicant's public sexual behavior in the workplace raises concerns under DC  E2.A4.1.2.4. of Guideline D.  In 2002 he 
touched a female coworker inappropriately and was given a written warning by his employer.  Second, in 2004, Applicant used an official Government 
computer to view photos of an on-line dating service, conduct which resulted in counseling by his employer.  This conduct occurred recently, when Applicant 
was more than 50 years old, and it is not the only indicator of Applicant's questionable judgment and irresponsibility.  Accordingly, Mitigating Conditions 
(MC) E2.A4.1.3.1., E2.A4.1.3.2., and E2.A4.1.3.3. do not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's several extra-marital affairs took place when he was assigned overseas on official Government business.  His liaisons were with foreign nationals, 
some of whom were employed by embassies abroad.  Applicant's wife was not aware of all of his affairs, and it is not clear that she  approved of or endorsed 
her husband's conduct.  Additionally, Applicant did not tell his security manager about his sexual contacts with foreign nationals.  In 2004, he conducted at 
least one affair with a foreign national after his interview with a special agent of the Defense Security Service.   Applicant's conduct raises security concerns 
under DC E2.A4.1.2.3. because it caused him to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  None of the mitigating conditions under Guideline D apply 
to Applicant's disqualifying conduct.  Accordingly, the Guideline D allegations of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.          </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline M - Misuse of Information Technology Systems</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline M of the Directive that Applicant's noncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to 
information technology systems, as alleged in &para;&para; 1.c., 1.f., and 2.a. of the SOR,  raised security concerns about his trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to 
properly protect classified systems, networks, and information (&para; 4.a.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1997, Applicant failed to comply with the policy and procedures at the Government agency where he was assigned.  He put an unapproved disk in a 
Government computer, causing the computer to become infected with a virus.  In 2002, Applicant was fired from a job requiring a security clearance when he 
used the Internet, in advance of official travel to the Middle East, to solicit female companionship, thus publicizing his travel and jeopardizing the security of 
his travel team and  coworkers.  In 2004, Applicant was verbally counseled for using an official Government computer to access the Internet to look at photos of 
an on-line dating service.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's two unauthorized entries into official Government technology systems in 2002 and 2004 and his 1997 unauthorized introduction of an unscanned 
and infected  software disk into a Government  computer, in violation of agency policy and procedures, raise security concerns under Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) E2.A.13.1.2.1. and E2.A.13.1.2.4. of Guideline M.  Applicant's misuse of Government technology systems was recent and significant.  His conduct was 
intentional, and his introduction of infected software was not authorized.  His misuse of information technology systems was not limited to an isolated event, 
nor was it followed by a prompt, good faith effort to correct the situation.  Accordingly, Mitigating Conditions (MC) E2.A.13.1.3.1, E2.A.13.1.3.2., 
E2.A13.1.3.3., E2.A.13.1.3.4., and E2.A.13.1.3.5. do not Apply to the facts of Applicant's case, and the Guideline M allegations of the SOR are concluded 
against the Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In my evaluation of the record, I have carefully considered each piece of evidence in the context of the totality of evidence and under all of the Directive 
guidelines that were generally applicable or might be applicable to the facts of this case.  Under the whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant has not 
successfully overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.</SPAN></P>
