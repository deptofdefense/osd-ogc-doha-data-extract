<P>Applicant, who held a security clearance while working for another federal agency from which he has retired, has two sisters who are citizens and residents of 
the People's Republic of China; another sister who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan; and in-laws who are Taiwanese citizens, permanent residents of the U.S.,

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 24 January 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="01-22134.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="01-22134.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 14 
February 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 14 October 2003.  I originally scheduled a hearing 
for 5 December 2003, but it was postponed at the request of Applicant's newly acquired attorney.  On 7 January 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on 
15 January 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULING ON EVIDENCE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>At the hearing, over the objection of the Government, Applicant called a witness to testify as an expert concerning the denial of Applicant's security clearance.  
The witness had served as a clearance adjudicator and a polygrapher in a Department of Defense agency for a period of years.  He has most recently been 
employed as a consultant by government contractors concerning security clearance issues.  Applicant wanted the witness to testify that, based on 20-30 hours of 
interviews with Applicant, he was convinced Applicant was not a security risk.  Applicant attorney contended that, "[w]ith his background dealing with these 
issues and dealing with people of different cultures who are in America working at [the federal agency at which the witness formerly worked], he brings an 
appreciation here for the trustworthiness and the credibility, and the key issue of whether someone can be trusted with our national secrets that I haven't seen 
before."  Tr. 31.</P> 
 
<P>In evaluating the admissibility of evidence, an administrative judge is not bound by the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Instead, we use them as a guide.  We are 
bound to admit evidence that is authentic and relevant and material to an issue to be decided.  <EM>See </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.19.  While the rules of evidence may be 
relaxed in administrative hearings, there is no reason to clutter the record with "junk science."  Thus, it is appropriate to apply the Federal Rules of Evidence as 
a framework for analyzing the proposed testimony. </P> 
 
<P>If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the tier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as 
an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon 
sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to 
the facts of the case. </P> 
 
<P>Fed. R. Evid. 702.  Neither the witness nor Applicant's counsel was prepared to discuss this case in terms of this standard.  The witness took notes during his 
many hours of interviews with Applicant, but did not bring them to the hearing or otherwise make them available to Department Counsel.  <EM>See</EM> Fed. R. Evid. 
705 (giving judge authority to require witness to disclose underlying facts on cross-examination).</P> 
 
<P>After carefully considering the witness's testimony, I concluded Applicant failed to establish Applicant was an expert within the meaning of the Federal Rules 
of Evidence.  Applicant failed to demonstrate that the testimony was the product or reliable principles and methods or that the witness had applied the principles 
and methods reliably to the facts of this case.  More importantly, Applicant failed to demonstrate how the witness's testimony would assist the trier of fact.  The 
fact that, based on his experience as an adjudicator at a different agency some years in the past, the witness believed the DOHA adjudicator's erred by issuing 
an SOR is not an issue within my purview.  My jurisdiction is limited to deciding whether it is in the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant.  The witness was certainly not qualified as an expert on whether Applicant should be granted a clearance.  Therefore, I denied the request to 
permit the witness to testify as an expert, but ruled that he could testify as a character witness.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 70-year-old native of China.  His father was a high-ranking official in the Chinese government before the communists overthrew it in 1949.  The 
family fled from what is now the People's Republic of China (PRC) to Taiwan, where Applicant was educated and performed his military service.  He became a 
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1972.  He worked for an agency of the U.S. government as a Chinese Language Officer for 27 years before he retired.  He held a top 
secret clearance at that agency.  </P> 
 
<P>From 1964-87, Applicant was married to his first wife, a U.S. naturalized citizen born in the PRC.  In 1988, he married his current wife, a U.S. naturalized 
citizen born in the Republic of China (Taiwan).  His current wife's parents are citizens of Taiwan, but permanent alien residents of the U.S.  They resided for 
some time with Applicant and his wife, but now reside with one of Applicant's wife's sisters who immigrated to the U.S.  They still spend considerable time in 
Taiwan.  Tr. 85.  Applicant's father-in-law was a high-ranking government official.  Tr. 98.</P> 
 
<P>One of Applicant's sisters, A, is a citizen and resident of Taiwan, but spends most of her time with her daughter who lives in Thailand.  She has lived, on 
occasion, with Applicant.  This sister and her daughter visited Applicant for a few days in 1998.  Applicant has two other sisters, Z and M, who are citizens and 
residents of the PRC.  Answer.  One of them was put in prison by the communists.  Tr. 104.  In 1997, Applicant traveled to Thailand for a family reunion, 
where he met with his sisters.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant played mahjong with a small group of friends.  One of these friends, C,  was married to L, an employee of the same federal agency for which 
Applicant worked.  L was convicted of espionage in 1986, after  admitting he provided the PRC sensitive information over an 11-year period.  Applicant met L 
and attended some social events at which L and his wife were present.  When the story broke that L had been involved in espionage, Applicant reported to his 
supervisor his contacts with C and L. </P> 
 
<P>While on assignment in Bangkok, Thailand, for the federal agency at which he was employed, Applicant went to a massage parlor for a massage.  Unbeknown 
to him, the individual he chose to give him a massage was a transvestite.  As soon as he discovered it, he terminated the encounter.  </P> 
 
<P>While he was on assignment in Singapore, Applicant's supervisor in the federal agency for which he worked directed him to rent a kiosk with government 
funds.  The supervisor later wanted the lease canceled.  "As the [agency] would suffer a loss of deposit if we canceled the lease, my [first] wife . . . and her 
friend took over the lease without knowing of the [federal agency] involvement and hired a cook."  Answer at 5.  <EM>See </EM>Ex. 4 at 18.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant retired from his job at the federal agency in 1993.  In 1997, another federal agency found Applicant unsuitable for employment in accordance with 
Exec. Or. 10450 and the adjudicative guidelines.  Ex. 12.</P> 
 
<P>On 20 April 1996, Applicant executed his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86).  In answer to question 14, he listed his sister Z's address as 
being in the U.S.  Z had been staying with her son, who is a U.S. citizen residing in the U.S., but had returned to the PRC.  Her son told Applicant that he 
expected her to return and live with him.  </P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged two of Applicant's sisters are citizens and residents of the PRC (&para; 1.a., 1.b.); another sister (&para; 1.c.) and his parents-in-law (&para;&para; 1.d., 
1.e.) are citizens and residents of Taiwan; and he traveled to Thailand in 1997 for a family reunion (&para; 1.f.).  A security risk may exist when an individual's 
immediate family and other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  
E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that members of his immediate family, and other persons to whom he has 
close ties of affection or obliation are citizens or residents of foreign countries (DC E2.A2.1.2.1)-two sisters who are citizen residents of the PRC; another 
sister is a citizen and resident of Taiwan; and his in-laws who are citizens of Taiwan and spend considerable time there.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 
DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (there is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection, or at least obligation, to the members 
of his wife's immediate family).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although it appears he had no contacts with his sisters while he was employed by the other federal agency, since retiring from that agency he has re-established 
relations with his sisters, even visiting Thailand for a family reunion.  While his contacts with his sisters in the PRC are not frequent, they are not so casual as to 
keep him from a position of vulnerability.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> His contacts with his sister in Taiwan have been closer and more frequent.  Applicant's relationship with his in-laws 
is neither casual nor infrequent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A determination that the immediate family members or associates are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the family member or associate and loyalty to the U.S. is a mitigating condition under Guideline B.  
C 1.  Applicant presented evidence that his sisters and his in-laws are not agents of a foreign government.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  However, the inquiry in a foreign influence case is 
not limited to consideration of whether the foreign contacts or connections are agents of a foreign power.  Rather, the foreign contacts or connections must also 
be evaluated in terms of whether they place an applicant in a <EM>position of vulnerability </EM>to be influenced by coercive or noncoercive means, even if there is no 
evidence that a foreign country has sought to exploit that vulnerability.  ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2003). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Such an evaluation requires 
consideration of the foreign countries involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is a totalitarian state that depends on the suppression of its people.  Applicant admits that, because of the prominence of his family in China before 
1949, his sisters Z and M, and their husbands have been treated unfairly by the communist regime that now controls the country.  The PRC has been involved in 
espionage against the U.S., both military and economic.  Although Taiwan is not hostile to the U.S., it has engaged in economic espionage against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's sisters and in-laws are not foreign agents, their presence in the PRC and Taiwan, subject to the pressures of the regimes, places Applicant in 
a position of vulnerability that could force him to choose between loyalty to the persons involved and loyalty to the U.S.  I find against Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had numerous contacts with a fellow employee of the federal agency who turned out to be a spy (&para; 2.a.); while working 
undercover in another country for the federal agency from which he retired, he operated an unlicensed kiosk in violation of law (&para; 2.b.); solicited a transvestite 
prostitute in Thailand in 1972 (&para; 2.c.); deliberately falsified his SF 86 by failing to give an accurate address for his sister (&para; 2.d.); was determined unsuitable for 
employment with another federal agency in 1997 (&para; 2.e.).  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive 
&para; E2.A5.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that Applicant knew L, the spy.  However, Applicant's contacts with the spy 
were casual, infrequent, and not as a result of any espionage activity.  L was a simply a member of the same federal agency whose wife happended to play 
mahjong with Applicant.  These circumstances do not create a security concern.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.a.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established that, while assigned to Singapore, Applicant leased a kiosk, at the direction of his supervisor, as part of a U.S. operation,.  When 
the supervisor decided to abandon the project, Applicant notified his wife at the time, who took over the lease and operated a noodle shop out of it.  It appears 
the shop was not licensed to do business, but the evidence does not support a finding Applicant actually operated the noodle shop or was aware it may have 
been in violation of Singapore law.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.b.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government failed to establish Applicant knowingly solicited a transvestite  at a massage parlor in Thailand.  The evidence established Applicant sought a 
massage and only later discovered the masseuse was actually a male, upon which he terminated the massage.  The Government failed to establish that seeking a 
massage demonstrated a lack of judgment or made Applicant susceptible to being exploited or blackmailed.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.c.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government failed to establish Applicant deliberately falsified his SCA by listing one of his sisters as living with her son in the U.S.  I find Applicant's 
explanation that his nephew thought his mother would return and live with him is credible.  Finding is for Applicant on &para; 2.d.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established Applicant was found to be unsuitable for employment with another federal agency.  Ex. 12.  This fact could be considered to be 
unfavorable information by other employers or acquaintances that could raise a security concern.  DC E2.A5.1.2.1.  However, such a decision is no more 
binding on the decision in this case than would the fact Applicant had received a favorable clearance from another federal agency.  The reasons for the other 
agency's decision are not clear.  Thus, there is no way of knowing whether the decision was based on a condition that no longer exists, and what, if any, 
mitigating conditions might apply.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.e.</SPAN></P>
