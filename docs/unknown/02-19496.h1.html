<P>This 41-year-old scientist was born in China in 1962, came to the U.S. in 1990, and became a U.S. citizen in 1999.  She was married, educated, started a family, 
and began a career here.  Most of her immediate Chinese relatives have now emigrated to the U.S. or are preparing to do so.  Her only remaining foreign 
relatives will be her sisters, with whom she has only a casual and infrequent relationship.  Applicant made a strong statement of understanding about her 
security obligations.  Mitigation has been established.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 28, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>On June 17, 2003, Applicant submitted a response to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative 
Judge after a hearing.  The matter was assigned to me for resolution on September 27, 2003.  On October 29, 2003, a Notice of Hearing was issued, setting the 
hearing for November 20, 2003.  At the hearing, the Government did not present any witnesses but offered one exhibit, which was marked for identification as 
Government Exhibit (GX) 1.  Applicant testified and offered 14 exhibits, which were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AX) A - N.  All exhibits were admitted 
without objection.  The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA on December 3, 2003. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 41 years old.  She was born in the People's Republic of China (China) in 1962,  and emigrated to the United States in 1990.  She became a U.S. 
citizen and obtained a U.S. passport in 1999.  The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. - 1.d. under Guideline  B (Foreign Influence).  Applicant admits SOR 1.b. 
and 1.d., with explanations and she admits SOR 1.a. and 1.c., also with explanations.  Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.</P> 
 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence derived from the hearing testimony and all evidence of record, I make the following additional FINDINGS OF 
FACT as to each SOR allegation:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)   </P> 
 
<P>1.a. - Applicant's husband <EM>is not </EM>a dual citizen of the U.S. and China.  He was born a Chinese citizen in China in 1961, but renounced his Chinese citizenship 
when he became an American citizen in 1999.  It is Applicant's understanding that China does not recognize dual citizenship.  In her security clearance 
application (SF 86) (GX 1 at Item 8), she cites her husband as a U.S. citizen only.</P> 
 
<P>1.b. - Applicant's parents <EM>are</EM> citizens of China.  Her father and mother, both retired medical doctors, are 78 and 74 respectively.  They came to the U.S., and 
obtained resident alien (Green) cards.  The are back in China now and plans are being made to have them come back to the U.S. permanently (Tr at 48-50).  
They intend to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as the five-year waiting period expires (Response to SOR).  </P> 
 
<P>1.c. - Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law <EM>are not </EM>dual citizens of the U.S. and China.  They are citizens of China only.  They are 69 and 68, and are 
retired from being an engineer and factory worker, respectively.  They are now permanent resident aliens in the U.S. and intend to apply for U.S. citizenship, at 
which time they would become U.S. citizens only.  They reside with Applicant and her husband in the U.S. (AX F, AX G, AX H, and AX I).  </P> 
 
<P>1.d. - Applicant's sisters <EM>are</EM> citizens of and reside in China.  Applicant has seen them only once since she left China 13 years ago.  Their contact is infrequent 
(Response to SOR).  One sister is an accountant with a telecommunications firm and the other is a nurse.  Neither of them has worked for the Chinese 
government and neither has ever asked Applicant to do anything improper or against U.S. security interests.   </P> 
 
<P>Applicant and her husband came to the U.S. to continue their educations, and both eventually obtained PhDs in 1994 and 1995, respectively.  Applicant's entire 
professional career has been in working for a major federal agency or for a defense contractor that does most its work for DoD.  Her contributions to her 
company have resulted in a major promotion after only two years.  Applicant received an interim security clearance that has since been withdrawn because of 
the present matter  (Tr at 22, 29-30, 35).  She has extensive publications in professional journals, has received awards for outstanding achievement, and has 
highly positive work evaluations (AX J and AX K).  Applicant and her husband have two young children who are Americans by birth here. They are growing 
up within American society, enjoying advantages that are only "for the privileged" in China.  They became U.S. citizens in 1999 because they both understand 
the benefits and advantages of life in U.S. society, including raising their children in a nice home and environment.  Applicant's response to any improper 
contact would be to "report [it] to U.S. authorities" (Response to SOR).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant called two character witnesses.  One was the Director of her unit.  He stated that Applicant's "integrity and honesty has never been in doubt," that she 
is "conscientious and follows the rules," and is "outstanding in every respect" (Tr at 28).  The second witness works with Applicant and says that beside being a 
conscientious worker, she is "very honest and open and [has] got great integrity as well" (Tr at 34).  Another colleague submitted a letter of recommendation 
expressing similar sentiments (AX N). </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's former Chinese passport became invalid and was surrendered to Chinese authorities (Tr at 45 and AX C)).  Since being naturalized, she has had and 
uses only her U.S. passport for all travel (<EM>Id</EM>.).  The same is true as to her husband (<EM>Ibid</EM>. and Tr at 47, 48, AX D, AX E).  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2).  I have considered all nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my 
overall conclusion.</P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence) </P> 
 
<P>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family [members] . . . are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These 
situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries 
. . . are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially  vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </P> 
 
<P>Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</P> 
 
<P>1. An immediate family member . . . is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns:</P> 
 
<P>1. A determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in question would not constitute an unacceptable risk. </P> 
 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6  identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance.  An applicant's admission of the information in specific 
allegations relieves the Government of having to prove those allegations.  If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the 
applicant, the Government has the initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  </P> 
 
<P>If the Government meets its burden (either by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the 
Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, 
despite the existence of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or 
continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The SOR expresses concerns about possible foreign influence from Applicant's relatives in China.  Applicant was born in China in 1962 and emigrated to the 
U.S. in 1990, becoming a citizen in 1999.  She has made a home in the U.S., married, had children, purchased a home, and been active in a career that has been 
of great service to her adopted country.  No conduct even suggesting a foreign preference is found in the evidence of record.  The existence of loved ones in a 
foreign country is always of security significance, but the fact that the relatives are citizens of and/or resident in China is of particular security concern.  China 
has been listed in publication of U.S. Executive Branch agencies as a country  with perhaps the most active espionage effort against the U.S.  I have carefully 
considered this fact in evaluating the evidence in this case.  Under DoD/DOHA rules, an Applicant has the burden of establishing that such foreign relatives are 
not an unacceptable risk.</P> 
 
<P>Based on the totality of the evidence, I conclude that Applicant has established that there is little risk her remaining relatives in China would be asked to 
pressure Applicant to disclose  classified information or that they would ask her to do so.  Disqualifying Condition 1 (family members in foreign countries) is 
applicable, but minimally.  However, based on the changing status of her parents and parents-in-law, and the relatively casual and infrequent contacts with her 
siblings, Although no improper contact has been attempted, I conclude that if it ever occurs, Applicant will, as she promises, promptly contact her company 
security officer or a government official.   For these reasons, I conclude that Mitigating Condition 1 (the relationship does not constitute an unacceptable risk) is 
both applicable and persuasive</P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered the identity of Applicant's native country and the higher risks that may occur.  However, based on the totality of the record, I 
conclude that Applicant has shown herself to be a woman of integrity and one who takes her obligation to protect U.S. security interests  seriously.  Considering 
the evidence as a whole, I conclude that the evidence does not show that any risk exists that Applicant would act against U.S. security interests. </P>
