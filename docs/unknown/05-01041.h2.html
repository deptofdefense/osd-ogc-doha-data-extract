<P>Applicant incurred approximately $11,895 in delinquent debt, approximately $7,874 of which consists of child support arrearages.  His delinquent debt and his failure to file state and federal income tax 
returns from 1996 to 2003 raises concerns under Guideline F.  Although he has paid off several debts, other debts remain delinquent and he has not filed his state and federal income tax returns.  
Criminal conduct concerns are raised based on his failure to file his federal income tax returns and four criminal incidents. I find he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application.  
However, he has not mitigated the concerns under Financial Considerations or Criminal Conduct. Clearance is denied.</P>

<P>On October 19, 2005,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended. The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security concerns under </SPAN>Guideline F, Financial Considerations; Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; and Guideline E, Personal 
Conduct.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement dated </SPAN>November 14, 2005<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing. </SPAN>The case was assigned to me on February 17, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A notice of hearing was issued 
on March 27, 2006, scheduling the hearing for </SPAN>April 20, 2006.  Applicant appeared at the hearing and requested a continuance.  I denied his request for continuance since he failed to show good cause 
for the continuance.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted 12 exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1-12.  The exhibits were admitted into the 
record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted 21 exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A-U. Applicant Exhibits A-U were admitted without objection. 
</SPAN>Administrative Notice was taken of three documents which were marked as Administrative Notice documents I-III. The record was kept open until May 4, 2006, for the submission of additional 
documents.  Applicant submitted three additional documents which were marked as AE V, W and X and admitted without objection. The parties agreed to submit written closing arguments by May 10, 
2006. Both parties submitted written closing arguments.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 15, 2006.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits that he has not filed federal and state income tax returns for tax years 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.  He claims he did not file because he was encountering 
financial problems as a result of his divorce. He was concerned he would not be able to pay any taxes owed so he did not file his returns.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> At hearing, he indicated that he contacted a tax consultant to 
help him with filing his returns.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> At the close of the record, no evidence was submitted indicating that he took steps towards filing his state and federal tax returns. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's financial problems began after he first filed for divorce. The court ordered him to provide child support for his step-daughter as well as his son.  He and his second wife had difficulty making 
ends meet because a lot of his take home pay was going towards child support. When they divorced in 1999, he was required to pay child support for his daughter. When he retired from the Army in 
December 2001, he had difficulty finding suitable employment and was unemployed from January 1, 2002, to June 15, 2003.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  In 2003, he moved to another city to take care of his mother who had 
undergone a serious operation and was in poor health.  Although he received a military retirement check, it was not sufficient to meet his living expenses as well as his child support obligations.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 15, 2003, Applicant started employment with his current company.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> His current take home pay is approximately $3,000 a month.  His annual income is $48,000.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  He did not submit a 
current budget.  His paycheck has been garnished for the child support arrearages. He believes he is now in a situation in which he can start to take care of his debts.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> He disputes the debts alleged in 
SOR &para;&para; 2.h, 2.i and 2.j.  He claims these are medical bills for his step-daughter. He claims he is not responsible for these debts since she is not his dependent.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  The record is unclear as to whether he 
took any formal steps to dispute these debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a  history of minor criminal offenses. In April 1990, he was convicted for writing a worthless check.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  In June 1990, he was convicted for writing a worthless check.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A>  On September 20, 
1999, his second wife sought a domestic violence protection order. The order was dismissed.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  On August 5, 2003, he was sentenced to 30 days in jail for indirect criminal contempt for failure to pay 
child support.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> Child support payments are being made through wage garnishment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is unclear whether the Applicant is paying the full amount of child support due each month in accordance with his son and his daughter's child support orders.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>On his security clearance application submitted in May 2003, Applicant responded "No" to question 26.  Your Police Record - Other Offenses which reads,</P> 
 
<P>In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24 or 25? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was 
alcohol or drug related.) For this item, report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been "sealed" or otherwise stricken from the record.  The single exception to this requirement 
is for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>He did not list his charge and subsequent 30-day jail sentence for indirect criminal contempt for failure to pay child support in August 2003.  He claims he did not understand the question.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On the same security clearance application, Applicant answered "No" in response to question "36. Your Financial Record - Tax Lien.  In the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your property 
for failing to pay taxes or other debts?"  He did not list the tax lien that was filed against him for failure to pay taxes owed in 1996 and 1997.  He claims he did not deliberately omit his tax lien. He did 
not understand the question. He also believed that he was not late since the Notice of Tax Lien indicated he had until 2009 to file.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> A Notice of Federal Tax Lien dated February 20, 2003,  indicates

<P>Applicant also answered "No" in response to question "38. Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days.  In the last 7 years have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" and question "39. Your 
Financial Delinquencies - 90 Days. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" He did not list his delinquent accounts that are alleged in SOR subparagraphs 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d and 2.h.  
He claims he did not recall these debts at the time he filled out his security clearance application. He did not have a credit report with him when he filled out the security clearance application.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's supervisor wrote a statement on his behalf. He indicates Applicant holds a SECRET security clearance and has never had any security violation issues.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  Applicant testified that he would 
never harm or jeopardize the United States government.  He has handled classified information throughout his 20 year military career and in his current job.  He just wants to provide for his family.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></P>

individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication 
that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under Guideline F, Financial Considerations; and 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Financial</STRONG> <STRONG>Considerations  </STRONG> </P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Applicant has incurred approximately $11,895 in delinquent debt. Under Guideline F, Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1: (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and FC DC 3 
E2.A6.1.2.3: (<EM>Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) </EM>apply to Applicant's case. The majority of the debt consists of child support arrearages for his two children. In addition to the delinquent debt, 
Applicant admits that he did not file federal and state income tax returns between 1996-2003. A federal tax lien was filed against him for taxes owed in 1996 and 1997. FC DC E2.A6.1.2.2: (<EM>Deceptive 
illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, or other intentional financial breaches of 
trust.</EM>) applies with respect to income tax evasion.  He admits that he did not file his state and federal tax returns because he was concerned he would not have the money if any taxes were owed.    </P> 
 
<P>The security concern under Guideline F can be mitigated.  I find Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1: (<EM>The behavior was not recent</EM>) does not apply. Although Applicant 
has paid the debts alleged in &para;&para; 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c, all other debts remain unpaid.  He has not filed his federal and state income tax returns for 1996 - 2003.  Therefore, I conclude the behavior is recent.  I 
cannot apply FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2: (<EM>It was an isolated incident</EM>) based on his numerous debts and his failure to file his state and federal income tax returns for eight years.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3: (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, 
divorce, or separation)</EM>) applies, in part, because Applicant has encountered financial difficulty as a result of his two divorces.  Applicant's unemployment for a period of approximately 18 months also 
affected his financial situation. However, he was not laid off or terminated from his place of employment.  He chose to retire from the military and should have prepared for his future after his 
retirement. In addition, Applicant's period of unemployment does not justify his refusal to file his federal and state income tax returns for over an eight year period. He was on active duty in the military 
for six of those eight years. For these reasons, I give little weight to the application of FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4: (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problems and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control</EM>) is not applicable because 
Applicant has not received financial counseling. Although he has paid off three of the debts, the other debts remain outstanding.  His financial issues are unlikely to be resolved or under control in the 
near future.  FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6: (<EM>The individual initiated a good-effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) does not apply because his federal and state income tax returns remain 
unfiled and he has not taken steps to resolve the delinquent debts alleged in SOR &para;&para; 2.d, 2.g, 2.h, and 2.i. </P> 
 
<P>I find for the Applicant with respect to SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and  1.c since he has paid these debts.  He has started to make progress in resolving his financial situation but still has a long way to go. A 
security concern remains under Guideline F. It is too early to conclude that Applicant's financial situation is completely under control.  I find against him under Guideline F.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a history of criminal conduct.  In 1990, he was convicted on two occasions for worthless check offenses.  In September 1999, a domestic violence protective order was issued against him.  
In August 2003, he served 30 days in jail for indirect criminal contempt for failure to pay child support.  His intentional failure to file federal income tax returns from 1996 to 2003 violates Title 26 
United States Code &sect;7203, a misdemeanor offense.<A HREF="05-01041.h2.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A>  The case record supports the application of Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1: (<EM>Allegations or admission of 
criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2: (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>I find none of the mitigating conditions apply under criminal conduct.  Since Applicant has not filed his federal income tax returns, his criminal behavior is recent. Therefore, Criminal Conduct 
itigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1: (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>) does not apply.  CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2: (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>) does not apply since he has a history 
of criminal offenses. Although he has served his punishment for the offenses in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, he has taken no steps to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 1996 to 2003.  I cannot 
apply CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6: (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) since the issue dealing with Applicant's failure to file federal income tax returns over an eight year period remains.  I 
find against Applicant under Guideline J.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard 
classified information.  Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in 
other official matters is a security concern.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  </P> 
 
<P>In this case, the record evidence fails to establish Applicant deliberately omitted or concealed information about his criminal history and financial problems. Although his answers to questions 26, 36, 
38, and 39 were incorrect, Applicant successfully rebutted the allegations that he deliberately provided a false answer. At hearing, he testified he could not recall his delinquent debts and did not have 
access to a credit report when filling out his security clearance application.  He misunderstood questions 26 and 36. I find his testimony credible. Guideline E is decided for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, common sense assessment of a person's life to 
make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" 
concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all 
relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</P> 
 
<P>In reaching my decision, I considered all the evidence provided and also considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests.  I 
acknowledge that Applicant honorably served over 20 years in the military and has held a security clearance with no security violations over the past five years in his current position. However, an 
applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in conduct that has negative security implications. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines F and J based on 
his financial history and his failure to file federal and state income tax returns from 1996 to 2003.  Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.<STRONG></STRONG></P>
