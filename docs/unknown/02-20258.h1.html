<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor and 23 year Air Force retiree who  works as a security analyst and specialist. Applicant was arrested 
twice in 2001 within a three month period for driving under the influence of alcohol and was found not guilty of each after trials. Applicant reported each 
incident to his supervisors and his security officers. After his trials he entered a counseling program for six months during which time he totally abstained from 
alcohol. Since then he drinks moderately twice a week and no more than two beers at each occasion. He does not drink and drive. He did not report two 
counseling sessions since one was over ten years old and the other involved only marital counseling. Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On September 4, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On November 3, 2003, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, attached ten exhibits and requested a hearing. 
The matter was assigned to me on April 29, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on May 5, 2004. A hearing was held on June 2, 2004. The Government 
introduced eight exhibits and the Applicant introduced four additional exhibits. All exhibits were admitted into evidence. The Applicant testified. The transcript 
was received on June 15, 2004.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor who retired from the Air Force after 23 years as a security analyst and specialist. After a complete 
review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record, the following findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant voluntarily entered a behavioral health program for six months in 1999 where issues relating to depression and alcohol were addressed. He was 
diagnosed with alcohol abuse. He has been married and divorced twice in 1988 and 1998. </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested twice in 2001 within a three month period between March and May for driving under the influence of alcohol and was tried and found 
not guilty of each. Applicant reported to and discussed each incident with his supervisors and his security officers. At the time of the arrests he was having 
difficulties in his personal life. </P> 
<P>Applicant held a Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) clearance for a number of years. The Air Force suspended the clearance after the 2001 arrests but 
restored it in November 2001.</P> 
<P>After his second trial in 1991 he recognized the need to address the root causes of his conduct and voluntarily entered a counseling program June 2001 for six 
months during which time he totally abstained from alcohol as the program required. He entered the program because he knew he had to insure control over 
excessive drinking. Since concluding the counseling he drinks moderately twice a week and no more than two beers at each occasion. He does not drink and 
drive. </P> 
<P>Applicant is highly regarded by his company. His supervisors applaud his work and his care in handling security matters. Since his counseling concluded in 
1991 he has received a performance award in 2003 and completed a college degree program in 2004 that he began in 1997. </P> 
<P>Applicant omitted information on his SF 86 filed in 1998 at Question 19 regarding counseling he received in 1986 and in 1996. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The first allegation concerning Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1 under Guideline G of the Directive (E2.A7.1.2.1.) raises the issues of 
alcohol related incidents away from work such as driving while under the influence or other criminal incidents related to alcohol use and consumption of 
alcohol to the point of impaired judgment (E2.A7.1.2.5.). The record of Applicant's two arrests and his diagnosis clearly shows that the Government has 
established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of alcohol abuse under Guideline G. Mitigating conditions (MC) are applicable in that Applicant 
has shown that the problems with abuse of alcohol ended three years ago and that there is no indication of a recent problem. (E2.A7.1.3.2.) Evidence was 
submitted of positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.) <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also alleged is Applicant's failure to report certain of the offenses under Guideline E that might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). 
Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security 
concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record the Government has established reasons to deny him a security clearance because of alcohol and personal conduct. Having 
established such reasons, the Applicant has the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the 
disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 
2001). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the policy prescribes, the burden shifted to the Applicant to show that the mitigating conditions are applicable to him. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has no arrests for alcohol abuse either before or after the two 2001 arrests. He acknowledges these were mistakes in conduct and he has gone through 
a strict analysis of his conduct as a result of the incidents and the counseling he received thereafter. His testimony indicates his serious concern based in large 
part on the fact that he has been a professional in the security field and recognizes that such incidents reflect adversely on his favorable career record. He 
manifests in a credible way a strong desire and determination not to allow a recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government conceded at the hearing that the omission of his 1988 counseling treatment was not required to be reported on his 1998 SF 86 since it was 
more than ten years old and thus beyond the reporting window. His 1996 counseling was for marital counseling prior to his second divorce. Applicant 
reasonably believe he was not required to report it as it was not a mental health matter. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that, because of the passage of 
time and the fact that the Applicant has changed his habits, the allegations relating to alcohol and criminal conduct in the SOR have been mitigated. He 
advanced a credible explanation of his failure to list information on the SF 86 to mitigate that allegation and justify the granting of a clearance.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline G  FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 1.a.:   For Applicant</SPAN></P>
