<P>Applicant had considerable debt from the failure of his businesses, and engaged in criminal conduct by failing to appear in court and shoplifting. Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations and criminal conduct security concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 10 February 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision<A HREF="04-02153.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 23 March 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. 
The case was assigned to me on 8 July 2005. On 18 August 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 25 August 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is 50 years old and currently unemployed. He was employed as a linguist for a defense contractor and will be rehired if he can obtain a security 
clearance. Ex. L. He was born and raised in Egypt. He came to the  U.S in late 1978 or early 1979 as a student. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 
September 1992 and obtained a U.S. passport in January 1999. Applicant is married to a native-born U.S. citizen; they have two children. </P> 
<P>In 1987, Applicant was arrested for failure to identify himself to a police officer. He spent one night in jail and was then released. A judge dismissed the case 
because there was not sufficient evidence to establish he did not identify himself. Ex. A.</P> 
<P>In 1990, he was arrested on two counts of speeding and one count of failing to appear. He was driving a taxi to support himself while he attended college. He 
paid the fine and has had only one ticket since.</P> 
<P>Applicant owned two import-export business. He traded apples and automotive parts to the Middle East. A business in Egypt placed several small orders with 
Applicant. Applicant shipped the goods and was paid. The business in Egypt then submitted a large order and paid $60,000 towards the purchase. Applicant 
shipped the order, but was never paid the amount due, well over $200,000. His inability to collect the remaining monies owed him ruined his businesses and his 
personal finances.</P> 
<P>As a result of Applicant's business losses and inability to pay his bills, a financial company that had loaned Applicant money to purchase equipment sued him. 
Applicant's lawyer withdrew from the case, leaving Applicant to fend for himself. The opposing attorney believed Applicant failed to provide all the discovery 
to which the opposing party was entitled. To exert pressure on Applicant to comply with the discovery request, in May 2001, the opposing attorney convinced 
the judge to hold Applicant in civil contempt and incarcerate him until he produced the documents. The documents were eventually produced and Applicant 
was released. The company obtained a judgment against Applicant. The opposing party's attorney reports that Applicant was always cooperative, may have 
been overmatched because his attorney withdrew, and greatly assisted in liquidating the remaining collateral and getting the plaintiff the best price for it by 
engaging buyers from the middle east. His assistance was so substantial, the finance company released him from the judgment in the fall of 2001. Tr. 18-21, 27. </P> 
<P>Applicant was employed as an Arab linguist for a defense contractor from January-August 2003, during which time he served in both Hungary and Iraq. In Iraq, 
he accompanied military units on front-line assignments. "He witnessed military and civilian casualties and the gruesome aftermath of a bomb explosion." Ex. 
G at 1. The captain in command praises Applicant' attitude, performance, and professionalism. Ex. I.</P> 
<P>While Applicant was deployed to Iraq with the U.S. military, one of his creditors filed suit. A default judgment was entered against him, although because of 
the deployment, Applicant was not in a position to defend himself.</P> 
<P>Applicant sought legal help to resolve his financial situation. When the attorney representing him was unable to arrange settlements which Applicant could 
afford, he recommended Applicant file Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Applicant did so in June 2005. The total debt load is in excess of $224,000. Tr. 28. Applicant's 
monthly payments are $150 for five years. The expectation is that the priority claims of $1,675 will be paid in full and the unsecured creditors will receive 
approximately 3 % of their allowed claims. Applicant has already made at least two payments to the trustee. Ex. B.</P> 
<P>In August 2003, after he returned from Iraq, Applicant was arrested for shoplifting at a military base exchange. He stole a pair of sunglasses valued at 
approximately $160. Ex. 5 at 8. The U.S. Magistrate Judge sentenced Applicant to a fine and one year of supervised probation. After Applicant completed the 
conditions of supervision, including the completing of an alternatives to shoplifting class, he was placed on unsupervised probation in March 2004. He 
successfully completed his probation in September 2004. Applicant was scheduled to return to Iraq a few days after he was arrested. Instead, the company 
terminated him.<A HREF="04-02153.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He is ashamed of his conduct. He still does not know why he did it.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had two judgments entered against him for $117,796 plus $15,474 in attorneys' fees (&para; 1.a) and $61,000 (&para; 1.e); accounts 
in collection status for $3,757 (&para; 1.b), $328 (&para; 1.c), $895 (&para; 1.d), $18,626 (&para; 1.f), and $3,100 (&para; 1.g); and had a past due debt of $180 (&para; 1.h). An applicant who 
is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established each of the allegations in SOR &para; 1, except &para;&para; 1.c and 1.h.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish 
potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F. Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable to satisfy 
his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> An applicant may mitigate financial considerations security concerns by establishing that the conditions resulting in the debts were 
largely beyond his control (MC E2.A6.1.3.3) and he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve the debts (MC 
E2.A6.1.3.6). Applicant's debts resulted from business losses he incurred when a middle eastern purchaser failed to pay Applicant for the goods. Applicant is 
resolving these debts through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. I found it significant that Applicant willingly worked with one of his creditors to ensure they were able 
to sell the collateral at a sufficiently high price to warrant releasing Applicant from the judgment it had obtained. Applicant is committed to fixing his financial 
situation, has made positive strides to do so, and future financial problems of this magnitude are unlikely. Applicant's payments to the bankruptcy trustee are 
small and well within his ability to pay. After considering all of the evidence of record, I find for Applicant on &para; 1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested in 1987 for failing to identify himself to a police officer (&para; 2.a); was arrested in 1990 for two counts of 
speeding and failing to appear (&para; 2.b); was arrested and charged with contempt of court (&para; 2.c), and arrested in August 2003 for shoplifting and later convicted 
of the offense (&para; 2.d). Applicant admitted each of the allegations. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions establish potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">J. Applicant engaged in criminal 
conduct (DC E2.A10.1.2.1) by committing multiple lesser criminal offenses (DC E2.A10.1.2). In evaluating Applicant's case, I considered that some of the 
offenses alleged were not criminal-speeding is a traffic as opposed to a criminal offense, and civil contempt of court is not a criminal offense. The most serious 
offense is the shoplifting offense which occurred in August 2003. I considered that this offense occurred shortly after Applicant returned from duty with combat 
forces in Iraq and shortly before he was to return to duty there. Applicant completed his probation and the required alternatives to shoplifting course, sought 
psychological counseling, and is remorseful for the offense. I conclude Applicant's criminal behavior was not recent (MC E2.A10.1.3.1) and there is clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation (MC E2.A10.1.3.6). After considering all the circumstances of the case, the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and 
the adjudicative process factors, I find for Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
