<P>Applicant's financial indebtedness remains current and he has not made a good faith effort to resolve his debts.  His intentional falsifications on his security 
clearance application have not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On January 29, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 12, 2004, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to 
the undersigned on November 23, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on December 22, 2004, scheduling the hearing for January 27, 2005.  At the hearing 
the Government presented seven exhibits.  The Applicant presented no exhibits, but he testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on 
February 11, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the Government's seven exhibits.  The Applicant is 34 years old.  He is 
employed by a defense contractor as a Security Guard and is seeking to obtain his security clearance in connection with his employment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)</SPAN>  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially 
overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits the delinquent debts set forth in allegations, 1(d), 1(e), 1(g), 1(h), 1(k), 1(l), 2(b), 2(c), and 2(d) of the SOR.  He denies the delinquent 
debts set forth in allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(c), 1(d), 1(e), 1(f), 1(J) and 2 (a).  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Answer to the SOR).  With respect to the debts that he denies, the 
Applicant admits that they are all reflected on his credit reports, but either does not remember them or does not believe he owes them.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Credit reports of the Applicant indicate that he is indebted to twelve different creditors totaling an approximate amount of $ 11,679.00.  (<EM>See </EM>Government 
Exhibits 2 and 5).  Each of the debts remains outstanding and delinquent, except a debt for a student loan in the amount of approximately $20,000.00 that is 
currently being paid through involuntary garnishment.  (<EM>See</EM> Tr. pp. 37- 43 and Government Exhibit 4).  There is no evidence in the record that the Applicant 
has been paying any of the other creditors as agreed since 2002.  He testified that he has had no contact with his past due creditors nor has he disputed any of 
the debts with the credit reporting agencies  (Tr. p. 38). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant testified that as a college student he was so negligent in handling his financial affairs that he applied for credit cards, ran up the debt and could 
not afford to pay them.  (Tr. p. 28).  He also purchased a car that he could not afford.  After September 11, 2001, he lost his job and could not pay his bills.  For 
the past three years, he has been working for his current employer and he has tried to re-establish his credit, but he had not paid any of his delinquent debts.  He 
has limited financial resources and is mainly concerned about paying his regular monthly expenses that include child support and his student loan garnishment.    
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material 
aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) dated August 5, 2002.  Question 23(a) of the application asked the Applicant if 
he had ever been charged with or  convicted of any felony offense.  The Applicant answered, "NO".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibits 1 and 7).  This was a false 
answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he had been charged with burglary in July 2001.   (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 6).  The Applicant testified that he 
believed and still believes that he was not charged with a felony.  He had an outstanding warrant at the time and believes that is why he was detained.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same questionnaire, question 23(f) asked the Applicant if in the last seven years had he been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offenses not 
listed in modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25.  The Applicant answered, "NO".  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibits 1 and 7).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to 
disclose that he had been arrested for Failure to Appear in both December 1999 and July 2001.  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 4).      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same questionnaire, question 27(d) asked the Applicant if in the last seven years had he had any judgment against him has not been paid.  The Applicant 
answered, "NO".  (<EM>See</EM> Government Exhibit 1 and 7).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to list the fact that he had a civil judgment entered against 
him in August 2000 for $1,741.00.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Answer to SOR).  The Applicant explained that his judgment never really came to mind when he answered 
the question.  (Tr. p. 58).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The same questionnaire, question 28(a) asked the Applicant if in the last seven years he had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant 
answered, "NO".  (<EM>See </EM>Government Exhibit 1 and 7).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to list any of his delinquent debts set forth in the SOR that 
remain owing and due.  The Applicant explained that he thought his delinquent debt occurred more than seven years ago.  (Tr. pp. 57-58).  He believed that he 
had re-established his credit and did not consider his old debts.  The Applicant also testified that at the time he filled out the application, he did not take the 
matter very seriously.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find that the Applicant knew or should have known to reveal the truth about his arrest for burglary and his delinquent financial history.  The fact that he does 
not believe he was charged with a felony, when he was, is no excuse.  The fact that he conveniently has forgotten about these debts is also no excuse.  I do not 
find any of the Applicant's excuses credible.  He states that he did not take the process of filling out the application very seriously and it obviously shows.  
Accordingly, I find that the Applicant deliberately attempted to conceal this information from the Government on his security clearance application.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following Disqualifying Factors 
and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.        The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and he has been untruthful 
on his security clearance application (Guideline E).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  
Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case.  With respect to his finances, the Applicant has in excess of $11,000.00 in delinquent debt.  His student loan is being paid through 
involuntary garnishment.  Other than one debt that he is paying, he has presented no other evidence to show that he has made or is making a good faith effort to 
pay off his past due creditors or resolve his financial indebtedness.  Upon review of his financial statement,  it appears that he may have a small remainder at the 
end of the month and obviously cannot afford to pay his past due debts.  There is no evidence of financial rehabilitation.  All of the debts, except the student 
loan debt that is being garnished remain owing, and he remains heavily indebted.  Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions <EM>(1) A 
history of not meeting financial obligations </EM>and <EM>(3) Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts </EM>apply.  None of the mitigating conditions (MC) apply.  His 
financial problems remain current, (MC)1; they are not isolated, (MC) 2; and the Applicant has not initiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve his debts (MC) 3<EM>.</EM>  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E, the Applicant has presented no reasonable excuse as to why he did not reveal his complete arrest and financial history in response 
to questions 23(a), 23(f), 27(d), and 28(a) on his security clearance application.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With the particular evidence that I have been provided, however, there is no 
reasonable excuse for his failure to answer the questions truthfully.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant has not been completely honest with 
the Government regarding his criminal history and he sought to conceal the truth.  Disqualifying Condition<EM> (2) The deliberate omission, concealment, or 
falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct 
investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities </EM>applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant deliberately failed to reveal this information to the 
Government.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement 
of Reasons.     </SPAN></P>
