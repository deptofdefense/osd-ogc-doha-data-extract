<P>While Applicant's financial problems raised security concerns because of his delay in resolving debts to three creditors, he has resolved his debts fully including 
over $20,000 owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unpaid personal income taxes for 1997 which he had disputed even though he had sufficient 
reserves to resolve these debts.  Finally, he resolved his debts to the IRS and to a school;  and he disputed persuasively a small debt to another creditor.  Also, 
he mitigated the personal conduct concern over his failure to list a 2002 IRS personal tax lien on his 2001 security questionnaire.  Thus, he has mitigated these 
security concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on December 9, 2002.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-19678.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over finances (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 and over personal conduct (Guideline E) in 
paragraph 2. Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on December 22, 2002, and requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who indicated on February 20, 2003, that the case was ready to proceed and the case was assigned to me.  
Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to and a Notice of Hearing, issued on March 14, 2003, set the matter for April 4, 2003.  At the 
hearing the Government introduced four exhibits which were admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1-4).  Applicant testified and asked that Official Notice be taken 
of one exhibit (ON I; TR 19-20).  He offered four exhibits (Exhibits A through D) which were admitted into evidence and asked for seven days additional time 
to submit additional evidence.  I granted him seven days until April 11, 2003 to submit additional evidence to Department Counsel and granted the Government 
three days until April 16, 2003,  to review and submit the evidence to me.  (TR 56-59)  While Applicant attempted to reach Department Counsel on April 11, 
2003, to request additional time, he did not succeed and submitted his documents by facsimile on April 13, 2003.  Department Counsel did not object to this 
delay and forwarded the documents to me on April 17, 2003, with no objection to their admissibility.  Consequently, Applicant's Exhibit E (20 pages) was 
admitted into evidence and the record closed.   The transcript (TR) was received on April 10, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 46 years old, is self-employed as head of his own company since July 1991.  He is a defense contractor in State #1. (Exhibit 1, Answer; TR 44-45)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has BS degree which he received in 1979 from a state university in State #2.  He married in 1983 and has one child.  He served in the military from 
1979 to 1986 and was honorably discharged; he has served in the national  guard<A HREF="02-19678.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> from 1985 to present.     (Exhibit 1; Exhibit E)   He also has a masters degree 
in business.  Applicant has had a security clearance for over 20 years.  (TR 24, 34) He stated he never had any incident or infraction in his military record and 
has attained the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.  He has received several commendation medals.   (TR 37-40; Exhibits C, E)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Finances and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>When Applicant applied for a security clearance in October 2001, he completed a Questionnaire for National Security Position (Standard Form 86) (SF 86).  
(Exhibit 1) </P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI> Applicant failed to disclose on the form in answer to Question 36, that he had a federal tax lien filed against him in August 2000.  (SOR 2.a.)    (Exhibit 1)  
In his Answer, he admitted that the tax lien existed, but denied he falsified material facts as he associated this tax lien with his company as his Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) corporation status is "C" not "S."  He claimed he had no reason to hide a "company" tax lien that he was disputing.  He was aware 
that he had an IRS lien outstanding on his personal taxes; part of the dispute involved his claim that with his "S" corporate status that he wanted to carry 
back all of his income and losses to his personal taxes.  (Answer; TR 21-25, 33-35)  Applicant explained he did not disclose this debt in answer to Question 
39 on the SF 86 (as a financial delinquency over 180 days delinquent) as in his view the IRS would ultimately owe him money; further he thought of the debt 
as a company obligation, not a personal one.  (TR 43-46)  In August 2002 he was questioned by the Defense Security Service (DSS) about adverse credit 
information; and he voluntarily provided full information on his finances and the dispute with the IRS.  (Exhibits 2, 3, 4)</LI> 
 
He has been attempting to resolve this dispute with the IRS since October 2000.  (Exhibit 4; Exhibit B)  Initially, the amount in dispute was $46,000.  (TR 
22)  He was sent a Final Notice from the IRS of their Intent to Levy in June 2002 which was addressed to him personally, not to his company.  (Exhibit 3; 
TR 46-47)  Applicant is not over extended as he owns 100% of his company that has generated $3 million in sales in the past three years and is expected to 
exceed $4 million in sales for CY 2003.   He expected to resolve the dispute with the IRS by March 1, 2003.  (Answer; TR 26, 52)  At the time of the April 
2003 hearing he had still not resolved the IRS dispute and admitted that the dispute with the IRS had "gone on longer than it should have."  He stated that 
several different IRS agents have been assigned to this dispute; he admitted that this IRS matter needed to be resolved.  While he took a "firm position" that 
he did not owe the IRS any money, he had not retained counsel to represent him; he had not make a priority to resolve the tax matter because of his other 
workload and out of state travel.  (TR 23-25, 27-28, 33; 41-42, 52-53)  Subsequent to the hearing, he paid his debt to the IRS in full and provided proof of 
delivery of his $20,984.42 check.  (Exhibit E)</LI> 
 
disputed because of the "unfair treatment" his daughter received at the school.  (Answer) In his view the school had "recruited" his daughter to attend the 
school and offered her scholarship money of $750 to $1000 which they never received.  He admitted that he had not handled the matter in the best way.  (TR 
29-30, 33) While he had offered to make a partial payment to settle the account, the collection company would only accept payment in full. (TR 47-49)  
Subsequent to the hearing he paid $800 to resolve fully this tuition debt to the school.  (Exhibit E)</LI> 
 
1.c.) (Exhibits 2), 4  (Answer; TR 30, 33; 49-50) Initially, he never disputed this item on his credit report as he did not consider his credit rating important as 
he did not anticipate he would need credit in the future given his finances.  (TR 54)  Applicant disputed this debt subsequent to the hearing.  (Exhibit E)</LI> 
 
 
<P>Applicant admitted he has somewhat neglected his credit rating as he believed that his company would provide him with enough financial security that he 
would not need credit ever in his lifetime.  (Answer)  Outside of  the debts in the SOR allegations, Applicant is otherwise financially stable<A HREF="02-19678.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> as he owns his 
company 100% and also owns his residence and his automobiles. (Exhibits A, E; TR 27)  His company has three locations in three different states and the 
company pays its bills on time.   He has people on his payroll in three states.  (Exhibit D; TR 31) He disclosed his salary from his company is $32,000.  (Exhibit 
D; TR 32)  However, he has $400,000 in cash reserves plus he anticipated additional income from completed contracts.  (Exhibit E; TR 55-56)</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  </P>

<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or

doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has (1) a history of financial problems and has shown (3) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy all of his debts.  He was sent a Final Notice from the 
IRS of their Intent to Levy in June 2002 which was addressed to him personally, not to his company.  Although he made some attempts to resolve these 
disputes, even on the date of the hearing he had failed to resolve a $20,000 debt to the IRS and a debt for tuition to his daughter's school.  (SOR 1.a. and 1.b.)  
(He disputes the minor debt for a credit card as he claims never to have had an account with that company.)  (SOR 1.c.)</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant admits he has not made it a priority to resolve the tax matter because of his other workload and out of state travel, Applicant has a good 
income with sufficient reserves to handle his financial obligations as he has a successful business.  Applicant effectively mitigated<A HREF="02-19678.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> his debts alleged in SOR 
1.a. and 1.b. by paying those debts in full in April 2003.  Mitigating condition (MC) 6 applies to these  those debts as he initiated a good faith effort to repay his 
overdue creditors: after the hearing he paid over $20,000 to the IRS to resolve the outstanding tax dispute (SOR 1.a.) and also paid his debt to the school for his 
daughter's tuition (SOR 1.b.).  I accept his statement that he did not have an account with the creditor listed in SOR 1.c. as he has disputed that small debt of 
$645.  Thus, Applicant has sufficiently demonstrated he is now financially responsible as he resolved the disputed debts.  Although these disputes raised 
concerns because of  long-standing nature and his failure to resolve them more quickly, he otherwise has acted responsibly and has substantial financial 
resources.  </P> 
 
<P>Also, Applicant serves successfully in the military reserves.  Indeed, a colonel in the national guard (who has supervised him for six years) appraised him as "an 
extremely professional and responsible" military officer with superb morals and ethics.  After considering the Appendix 8 Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under SOR Paragraph 1; I conclude that he has mitigated the allegations in SOR subparagraphs1.a. through 1.c.    </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant failed to reveal a personal IRS lien on his SF 86 form. This failure to disclose led the Government to raise security concerns over personal conduct 
issues.  Applicant's omission of relevant and material information about this debt could reflect questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not properly safeguard classified information.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant rebutted and overcame these Government's security concerns by demonstrating  that he has mitigated<A HREF="02-19678.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> this concern under MC 2 and 3.  I find his 
explanation credible.  As he is self-employed, he believed the dispute with the IRS over his 1997 income tax involved the treatment of his company income and 
expenses and would ultimately be resolved in his favor.  The Government's evidence of the tax levy was dated June 2002, several months after he completed 
this SF 86 in October 2001.  Further, at the DSS interview in August 2002 Applicant was not confronted, but volunteered extensive information about his 
dispute with the IRS and attached a full history of his dispute.  He explained the basis for his initial belief that it was a business-related matter.  He successfully 
demonstrated that he had misunderstood the question on the security clearance questionnaire.  Further, there is evidence in the DSS statement that Applicant  
made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omissions before being confronted with the facts.  Hence, Applicant met MC 2 and MC 3:  the falsification was 
an isolated incident, and he has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily; and he made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before 
being confronted with the facts.  Further, a friend who, though now employed by Applicant, who has known him for 23 years, assesses Applicant as having 
"always exhibited the utmost integrity and character in all of his personal and professional activities."  He recommends Applicant for a security clearance. After 
looking at the whole person and considering the Appendix 8 Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 
2.a.. under SOR Paragraph 2.</P>

<P>After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
