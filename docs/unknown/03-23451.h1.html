<P>Applicant deliberately falsified his security-clearance application by minimizing his use of marijuana and by omitting a 1996 arrest for possession of marijuana. 
In addition, he is unable to successfully mitigate the security concerns stemming from (1) a child-support arrearage for more than $35,000.00, and (2) willfully 
failing to file state and federal income tax returns for several years. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On January 10, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security 
concerns under Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification), Guideline F for financial considerations, and Guideline J for criminal conduct. Applicant 
replied to the SOR on February 1, 2005, and again on March 4, 2005. He admitted the allegations in the SOR subparagraphs, provided an explanation, and 
included a character reference. Also, he indicated he did not desire a hearing.  </P> 
<P>On April 8, 2005, Department Counsel submitted her written case consisting of all relevant  and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This 
so-called File of Relevant Material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on April 26, 2005. Applicant did not submit any information 
within the 30-day period after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2005. Issuing a decision in this case was delayed due to a heavy 
caseload.</P> 
<P><CENTER> <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old man employed as a Drafter II for a defense contractor doing business at a naval weapons station. It appears Applicant is seeking to 
obtain a security clearance for the first time. </P> 
<P>On or about September 18, 2002, Applicant completed and signed a security-clearance application. In doing so, he was required to certify that his statements on 
the form were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and made in good faith. Applicant has a history of illegal drug involvement 
and answered certain questions on his security-clearance application as follows:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>In response to Question 24,<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant answered "no" thereby denying any drug- or alcohol-related offenses. </LI> 
  <LI>In response to Question 27,<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant answered "yes" and indicated he had used marijuana on a monthly basis from January 1, 1997, to August 1, 
1997. </LI> 
<P>The ensuing background investigation revealed derogatory information about Applicant in the following areas: (1) marijuana use; (2) a drug-related arrest; (3) 
failure-to-file state and federal income tax returns for several years; and (4) a substantial child-support arrearage. Applicant addressed these four subjects in 
September 2003 when he provided a sworn statement during the background investigation.</P> 
<P>Concerning marijuana use, he admitted providing inaccurate information about his marijuana use on his security-clearance application. As described by 
Applicant, his marijuana use was on a periodic basis over several years:</P> 
<P>I first used marijuana while a senior in high school. I consumed marijuana in cigarette form while attending parties and other social type functions. I smoked 
marijuana about a dozen times during the school year on weekends. I began smoking marijuana again beginning at age 24. I would smoke it infrequently, 
usually in the company of friends on the weekends; sometimes I would be alone. At this point my use of marijuana was infrequent. I always kept a small 
personal amount of marijuana for my use when I had a desire to smoke the drug. I cannot recall how often I smoked marijuana. My last use of marijuana was 
spring 2000. I smoke marijuana because this was my choice of vices. I did smoke marijuana monthly from Jan 97 to Aug 97 to get relief from my ocular 
migraine headaches. I would spend $10.00 to $20.00 monthly to purchase marijuana during this period.   </P> 
<P>Applicant stopped using marijuana in 2000 when he recommitted his life to his God. He explained he did not list the full extent of his marijuana use on his 
security-clearance application because he was afraid doing so would prevent him from obtaining a security clearance. </P> 
<P>Applicant also explained the circumstances surrounding his arrest in 1996 for possession of marijuana. Applicant and a friend were both arrested while sitting 
in Applicant's car. The friend had the marijuana, but both were arrested and taken to jail. As a first-time offender, Applicant's case was handled via a pretrial 
diversion program, which he successfully completed. Applicant believes the marijuana possession charge was expunged from his record, but he has not 
provided documentary proof of his belief. He did not list this matter in response to Question 24 because he did not read the whole question and did not realize 
he was required to report it.   </P> 
<P>The SOR alleges and Applicant admits willfully failing to file federal income tax returns for the years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, and 2002. Likewise, he willfully 
failed to file state income tax returns for the years 1992 and 1993. Applicant addressed his failure-to-file in his sworn statement as follows:</P> 
<P>After my former wife left me in 1992, I also lost my job due to my company closing and relocating. I could no longer pay my bills and after a year of struggling, 
I moved back to [State B] in 1993. I was under a lot of stress and filing my taxes was just not a priority. I did file my federal income tax return in 1996. In 2001 
I began working with the IRS to straighten out my back tax obligation. In May 02, the IRS took my refund of $8,380.21 and forwarded it to the [State A child-support agency] to apply to my child support arrearage. I have not filed my federal income tax return for tax years ended 31 Dec 02. I realize that I am required 
by law to file my state and federal taxes each year. However, I have consciously decided not to file these tax returns because I realize my refund will be held and 
sent to my former wife as payment on my child support arrearage. I intend to file my federal income tax return next year (2004) for tax year 2002 and 2003. By 
this time we should have the child support agreement worked out. I have not filed my state income taxes as required in [State A] for tax years 1992 and 1993. I 
have filed personal income tax returns in [State B] since moving here in 1993.   </P> 
<P>Applicant has not provided any documentary proof that he has resolved the issues stemming from his failure-to-file state and federal income tax returns. </P> 
<P>The SOR alleges and Applicant admits to owing a substantial child-support arrearage stemming from his divorce from his first spouse. His arrearage has been 
as high as $48,695.00. As of August 31, 2003, his arrearage was $36,237.11. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that his ex-wife would cancel or 
forgive the arrearage, but she had not yet done so. He also indicated he was paying his current child support obligation as well as paying some toward the 
arrearage. Applicant has not provided any documentary proof to support his claim, and so, I presume the arrearage is still outstanding.</P> 
<P>Applicant and his spouse are members in good standing of a ministry, and Applicant submitted a character reference from the ministry's pastors. The character 
reference describes Applicant in positive terms, and the pastors believe Applicant demonstrates stability and integrity.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a 
determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Instead, it is determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for granting 
a clearance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral 
statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An omission of relevant and material information, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, 
misunderstood the question, or thought the arrest had been expunged from the record and did not need to be reported.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline E. I conclude Applicant deliberately provided false and 
misleading information about his history of illegal drug involvement when he completed his security-clearance application. Concerning Question 27, Applicant 
sought to minimize his marijuana use by providing false and misleading information about his marijuana use. He admitted providing inaccurate information 
about his marijuana use in his sworn statement. Concerning Question 24, Applicant admits providing the wrong answer, but denies any intent to falsify or 
mislead. His denial is not credible in light of the plain language of the question coupled with his admitted false answer to Question 27. I conclude Applicant 
provided a false answer to Question 24 for the same reason he provided a false answer to  Question 27--he was concerned that telling the truth would prevent 
him from obtaining a security clearance. Considering the totality of facts and circumstances, I cannot conclude Applicant made a good-faith effort to answer 
Questions 24 and 27 in an accurate and truthful way. Accordingly, DC 2<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> applies against Applicant. His falsification of his security-clearance application 
creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.     </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline E and conclude none apply. Falsification of a security-clearance application is a serious matter, not easily 
mitigated or extenuated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, a security concern typically exists for two different types of situations--significant unpaid debts and unexplained affluence; this case 
involves the former. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial 
obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline F. The child-support arrearage of more than $35,000.00 
demonstrates a history of not meeting financial obligations as well as inability or unwillingness to pay one's just debts.<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> The same facts and circumstances 
demonstrate financial irresponsibility. Of special concern here is the nature of the obligation, because his failure to pay child support indicates a refusal to 
accept responsibility for the consequences of his actions. This character trait does not enhance Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   I reviewed the mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none apply. Although Applicant experienced a divorce and a period of unemployment, 
those events took place years ago and he has not provided any information showing why those events continue to prevent him from resolving his ongoing child-support arrearage. Likewise, Applicant has not provided any information to substantiate his claim that his ex-wife has cancelled or forgiven the arrearage. 
Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or 
procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline J. Applicant engaged in criminal conduct (a misdemeanor 
offense) by willfully failing to file state and federal income tax returns for several years. In addition, Applicant's falsification of his security-clearance 
application is in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, which is a felony offense. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Given these circumstances, both DC 1<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="03-23451.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> apply against Applicant. His 
criminal conduct creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. No mitigating conditions apply. In particular, there is not solid proof that 
Applicant has successfully resolved his state and federal tax obligations. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I considered the evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and 
other appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.   </SPAN></P>
