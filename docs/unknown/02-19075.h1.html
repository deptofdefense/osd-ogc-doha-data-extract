<P>Applicant, a 68-year-old married man, is employed as an investigator for a defense contractor. His son, daughter-in-law, and minor grandchildren are lawful 
residents in China pursuant to their work with a religious-based humanitarian organization. Based on the totality of facts and circumstances, Applicant has 
successfully mitigated the security concern for foreign influence under Guideline B. Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 11, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security 
concern under Guideline B for foreign influence based on the residence of Applicant's son, daughter-in-law, and minor grandchildren in China. Applicant 
answered the SOR on September 2, 2003, and, subsequently, on September 23, 2003, submitted an addendum to his answer. Applicant requested a clearance 
decision based on a hearing record.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel indicated they were ready to proceed on or about October 22, 2003, and the case was initially assigned to another administrative judge the 
next day. On October 29, 2003, the case was reassigned to another administrative judge. Thereafter, on November 3, 2003, the case was assigned to me due to 
case load considerations, and on November 13, 2003, a notice of hearing was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for December 16, 2003. Applicant's 
counsel filed his notice of appearance on November 17, 2003. Applicant appeared with counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. DOHA received the 
transcript January 5, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's answer to the SOR is mixed. In addition, after a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following essential findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 68-year-old married man and a native-born U.S. citizen. He attended college where he participated in the Air Force ROTC program and was a 
member of the college's corps of cadets. After graduating in 1957, he accepted a commission as an Air Force officer, immediately reported for active duty, and 
received pilot training. Subsequently, he served as a fighter pilot for about six years until his discharge in 1962. Applicant served in the inactive reserves until 
his retirement.</P> 
 
<P>While on active duty, Applicant received various types of training, including the handling of classified information and how to conduct oneself if captured and 
interrogated as a prisoner of war. Applicant described himself and his fellow trainees at the time as "gung-ho" in that they were determined never to give up any 
information that might aid the enemy. Applicant adheres to the same conviction today.</P> 
 
<P>From 1962 to 1988, Applicant worked as a deputy in a county sheriff's air auxiliary unit and later commanded the unit. In other words, he was a law-enforcement officer where he worked as a detective, performed search and rescue, transported prisoners, and also worked in undercover sting operations.</P> 
 
<P>In 1988, Applicant moved to a western state where he accepted a position with a major defense contractor. He worked in safety and security from 1988 until 
about three years ago or so, and has since worked as a contract investigator conducting background investigations of people seeking to obtain or retain access to 
classified information. During his employment with the major defense contractor, and its successor in interest, Applicant described his duties as follows:</P> 
 
<P>It was my job to design, oversee the construction of tempest vaults classified areas, to write the security procedure, to protect documents in that area, debrief the 
people working in that area, to assist them in preparing their SF-86 applications to secure security clearances and the most notable there was [that] we were the 
first facility that built a multi-functional closed area that was approved by DSS to have multiple programs in the same facility and meet all the guidelines of 
DSS.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant described his 46 years of employment as being in the business of "protecting and securing our country" in one capacity or another.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant was 
initially granted a security clearance while an active duty Air Force officer. Applicant was also granted a security clearance for his employment with the major 
defense contractor.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant and his spouse of 46 years are the parents of three sons born in 1959, 1962, and 1963. Applicant's second son, who is now 42 years old, is the subject 
of the SOR. This son and his wife and three children have lived in China since 1998, as they decided to follow their religious conviction to serve the poor and 
picked China as the place to do so.</P> 
 
<P>The son is the president of a rural development organization working in a certain province in China. The organization is a Nevada nonprofit corporation, which 
is tax exempt under U.S. federal laws as a charitable organization, and is registered with the Chinese government as a humanitarian non governmental 
organization. According to the son, the organization is working in one of the poorest areas of China, and has developed programs to build schools and to train 
farmers as well as participating in disaster relief. The organization has a staff of about 30 persons from various countries, including the U.S. About half the 
employees are local Chinese citizens. Applicant's son and his family reside in China via the proper visas and work permits issued by the Chinese government. </P> 
 
<P>The son's relationship with the Chinese government is otherwise limited to interactions involved with obtaining approval for and performance of the 
organization's humanitarian work. The son explained they do not use the term "missionary" in China as it would be misunderstood with 19<SUP>th</SUP> century western 
imperialism. Likewise, the son denied he or the organization practiced covert missionary work.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The son describes the organization as a strictly apolitical 
organization that works openly in compliance with Chinese law. The son's relationship with Chinese officials has been positive largely due to willingness to 
take on the various projects that help the local Chinese. In this regard, the son explained that "[w]e are very careful not to do anything that would cause the 
Chinese people and government officials with whom we work to lose face, and they likewise do not act in any way to pressure or even to embarrass us" 
(Exhibit C). If a situation became overly difficult,  contentious, or untenable, the likely response from Chinese officials would be to ask the person or persons to 
leave China (Exhibit D).</P> 
 
<P>Concerning the issue whether Applicant could be susceptible to pressure as a result of the family members' residence and work in China, the son described that 
possibility as "ludicrous." The son denies ever having been subject to any type of pressure from Chinese officials, and asserts he would never do anything to 
place his father in a potentially compromising situation. To do otherwise would violate "the most basic tenets of patriotism, [religious] ethics and personal 
character that both my father and I share" (Exhibit C).</P> 
 
<P>When the son informed Applicant of his intent to live and work in China serving the poor, Applicant discussed the possibility of a hostage situation. Based on 
his concern about Americans being kidnaped and held hostage while working overseas, coupled with his employment with the major defense contractor at the 
time, Applicant told his son that he could in no way help if the son or family were taken hostage. Both Applicant and son were reconciled to this possibility. 
Indeed, the entity that supports the son's organization has an official policy on the subject of hostage taking:</P> 
 
<P>All our personnel serving overseas are briefed that should they be the victims of hostage taking or otherwise placed in a position where their custodians are 
demanding money or other thing of value in exchange for their freedom, our agency as a matter of policy will not accede to such demands, nor negotiate with 
those who seek to capitalize upon our personnel's vulnerability (Exhibit D).</P> 
 
<P>At this time, Applicant believes his son and family plan to remain in China for the foreseeable future, although they do not intend to make China a permanent 
home.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant believes there is no "conceivable event"<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> that could result in him compromising national security, including hostage taking as discussed above. If 
approached or confronted by someone desiring Applicant to compromise national security or classified information, Applicant would report the contact to the 
proper governmental agency.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>   </P> 
 
<P>China, also known as the People's Republic of China (PRC), is hostile to the U.S., and has interests inimical to those of the U.S.; likewise, the PRC has a poor 
human rights record.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> In addition, I took administrative or official notice of the following matters:</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Although the Chinese constitution affirms religious toleration, the Chinese government places restrictions on religious practices outside of officially 
recognized organizations (Exhibit 2, at pp. 2-3). </LI> 
  <LI>There are religious humanitarian organizations that operate in China in compliance with Chinese law without the need for secrecy (Exhibit F). </LI> 
  <LI>The PRC is known to engage in espionage, economic and otherwise, against the U.S. (Exhibit 3). </LI> 
 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following security guidelines are most pertinent 
here: Guideline B for foreign influence.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and there is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving 
controverted facts.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> The 
DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a 
scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of

favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline B for foreign influence, a security concern may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the 
potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries, or financial interests in 
other countries, are also relevant if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, the stronger the ties of affection or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or close associate is 
brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service. </SPAN>Concerning family ties, the language of Guideline B does not require a 
conclusion that an unacceptable security concern exist based solely on an applicant's family ties in a foreign country.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> An administrative judge must consider 
the record evidence as a whole in deciding if the facts and circumstances of an applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable security concern under Guideline 
B.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline B because Applicant's son, daughter-in-law, and three 
minor grandchildren are residents in China. The son is an immediate family member, while the daughter-in-law and three minor grandchildren are family 
members that Applicant is bound to by close ties of affection. Accordingly, given these facts and circumstances, DC 1<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> applies against Applicant. I have 
reviewed the remaining DC under the guideline and conclude none apply.</P> 
 
<P>I have reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude that MC 1<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> applies for Applicant. It's clear that Applicant's son, daughter-in-law, and three minor 
grandchildren are not agents of the Chinese government or any other foreign power. In addition, I am persuaded the family members' residence in China does 
not put them in a position that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family members and the U.S. This conclusion is based on several reasons, 
such as: (1) it is unlikely the religious-based humanitarian organization will provoke Chinese officials since the organization (including the son and daughter-in-law) does not practice covert missionary work; (2) it is unlikely the Chinese government will target the family members given the apolitical, benign nature of 
the organization's humanitarian work; and (3) in the unlikely event Applicant was faced with such a difficult situation, Applicant's strength of character and 
massive integrity assures he would choose loyalty to the U.S. Indeed, this type of situation (hostage taking) was contemplated by both Applicant and his son 
before the son's departure for China. I have reviewed the remaining MC under the guideline and conclude none apply.</P> 
 
<P>Although MC 1 is the only applicable mitigating condition, the analysis does not necessarily end as other facts and circumstances may mitigate the security 
concern.<A HREF="02-19075.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> First, Applicant appears to be a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy individual. Second, Applicant's commitment and ties to the U.S. are 
substantial as evidenced by his affirmative choices. He chose to serve his country as an Air Force fighter pilot. He chose to serve as a law-enforcement officer. 
He chose to serve his country by working in safety and security for a major defense contractor. Indeed, as pointed out by Applicant, his 46-year history of 
employment has involved security in some capacity. Third, Applicant has a high degree of appreciation for the need to properly handle and safeguard classified 
information, and I have no doubt he can be relied upon to do so in the future. All these matters are relevant and material facts that weigh heavily in his favor 
under the whole-person concept. </P> 
 
<P>To sum up, based on the record as a whole, it is my predictive judgment that Applicant has the willingness to resist and report any potential foreign influence by 
either coercive or non coercive means. Likewise, it is my commonsense determination that the totality of facts and circumstances show that the presence of 
Applicant's family members in China does not pose an unacceptable security concern or risk of foreign influence. In reaching this decision, I considered the 
hostility of the Chinese government toward the U.S. as well as China's ongoing efforts to conduct various forms of espionage against the U.S. Nevertheless, 
Applicant has overcome the case against him and met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly, Guideline B is 
decided for Applicant.</P>
