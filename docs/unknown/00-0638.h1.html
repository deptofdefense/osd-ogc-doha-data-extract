<P>Forty-three year old Applicant's financial problems stemming from a business failure, which resulted in both business and personal bankruptcies in August 2000, as well as 
a federal tax liability to the IRS in the amount of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">$32,308.44, </SPAN>were mitigated by the conditions which caused the bankruptcies (they were business related); the isolated 
nature of the problem; and the fact that he initiated good faith efforts to resolve the indebtedness, and actually paid it off approximately 30 days prior to the hearing.  
Clearance granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 7, 2000, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn written statement, dated November 27, 2000, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing.  The case was initially 
assigned to Administrative Judge John G. Metz, Jr., on January 30, 2001, but, due to caseload considerations, was reassigned to, and received by, this Administrative 
Judge that same day.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 14, 2001, amended on March 21, 2001, and the hearing was held before me on March 29, 2001.  During 
the course of the hearing, two Joint exhibits, six Government exhibits, and eight Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of one Applicant witness (the Applicant), were 
received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 30, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has denied the sole factual allegation pertaining to financial matters under Guideline F (subparagraph 1.a.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43 year old male employed by a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  He previously held a TOP SECRET security 
clearance from about 1982 until 1996.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant spent sixteen years on active duty with the U.S. Air Force<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> before resigning his commission in April 1996<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> to create a business--a subchapter "S" 
Corporation--with a partner. They opened a restaurant seating 260 persons in early 1997.  Despite an initial investment by Applicant of about $200,000.00 in savings 
and investments, the restaurant business failed in August 1998, and Applicant was forced to take both personal and business bankruptcy.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  His debts were discharged 
under Chapter 7 in March 1999.  Unfortunately for Applicant, the discharge did not resolve his business tax obligations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As the direct result of the failed business venture, Applicant became indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), in the amount of approximately $32,308.44,<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
including penalty, for unpaid employment taxes for certain tax periods ending in 1997 and 1998.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed amended tax returns because of the losses he experienced from his failed business investment in the anticipation his refunds would offset his tax liability.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  
That tax liability was reduced by $4,363.00 on May 15, 2000 when the IRS applied that amount of his overpaid tax on his 1999 tax return to the unpaid balance.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  It 
was further reduced by $14,415.41 on July 10, 2000 when the IRS applied that combined amount of his overpaid taxes on his 1994,<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 1995,<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> and 1996<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> tax returns to 
the unpaid balance.  It was again reduced by $7,846.02 on August 7, 2000, when the U.S. Bankruptcy Court ordered a disbursement of remaining assets in that amount 
to the IRS.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three other factors entered into the overall situation.  In January 2000, Applicant and his wife were divorced, and pursuant to their marital settlement, each party agreed 
to assume responsibility for 50% of the outstanding IRS tax liability.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  In June 2000, Applicant submitted an Offer in Compromise to the IRS in which he sought to 
resolve the entire remaining balance through the payment of $500.00.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  The Offer was never acted upon by the IRS.  The third factor impacting the situation was the 
refusal of Applicant's partner to accept any financial responsibility for the bankruptcy or the IRS liability.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  As a result, the IRS assigned responsibility and liability solely 
to Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS) on June 27, 2000, he described the various anticipated methods by which the 
outstanding balance of the entire tax liability would be reduced to approximately $7,594.00, should his Offer in Compromise not be accepted.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  On November 7, 2000, 
the date of the SOR, the remaining tax liability owed to the IRS was only $7,105.19.  On November 27, 2000, in his Response to SOR, Applicant clarified the amount 
due by describing the various payments already made as well as the split responsibility arising from his agreement with his former wife.  He contended his remaining 
obligation was in the amount of $2,842.00,<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> not the $27,945.44 alleged in the SOR.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 27, 2001, approximately one month prior to the hearing in this matter, Applicant paid off the entire remaining balance on the tax 
liability--$7,105.19--including the portion for which his former wife was responsible.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  By the date of the hearing, Applicant had satisfied the entire tax liability.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant completed his financial statement for DSS in June 2000, he reflected a monthly net remainder of approximately $58.00.  As a direct result of his 
dedicated and aggressive money management activities, and the absence of the albatross of the failed business venture, he has reduced the IRS tax liability to zero and 
increased his monthly net remainder to $515.64.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to his venture into the business world, Applicant had extensive savings and investments, and excellent credit.<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  His foray into the restaurant business changed 
everything.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon Applicant's divorce in January 2000, his wife was awarded custody of their daughter and he was awarded custody of their two sons.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has been employed by his current employer, a federal contractor, since November 1998.  The quality of his performance has not been described.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an individual's eligibility for 
access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual's eligibility for access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the Directive, are 
intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an Administrative Judge 
should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>[Guideline F - Financial Considerations]: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
Unexplained affluence is often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) a history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) it was an isolated incident;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business turndown, unexpected medical emergency, 
or a death, divorce or separation);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(6) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the issuance of the 
clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="00-0638.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes herein, despite the different 
language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have endeavored to draw only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have attempted to avoid drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or 
conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the 
Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets its burden, the 
heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised 
by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of the witness credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">With respect to Guideline F, the Government has established its case.  When Applicant was on active military duty, prior to resigning his commission to enter the business 
world, he had extensive savings, investments, and excellent credit.  Unfortunately, his unsuccessful foray into the business world, cost him his savings, investments, good 
credit, and plunged him into a situation for which he was apparently unprepared.  The business failed, he became indebted to the IRS in the amount of $32,308.44, and he 
declared bankruptcy.  The commencement of his financial problems came sometime prior to the actual business failure in August 1998, and continued until he actually paid 
off the entire tax liability in February 2001.  Thus, during that period, Applicant's conduct pertaining to his financial obligations fell within Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1., and DC E2.A6.1.2.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's business-related financial</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> misfortune was relatively brief in duration</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and significantly aberrant in nature, bringing it within Financial Considerations Mitigating 
Conditions (MC) E2.A6.1.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">. and MC E2.A6.1.3.3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  It is true that for a brief period he was unable to satisfy his debts, and as a result, he took advantage of legal 
means to resolve all but one of his debts--the tax liability to the IRS.  He then turned his attention and efforts to resolving that liability.  It was successively reduced by the 
application of a variety of payments so that by the time the SOR was issued in November 2000, Applicant no longer was indebted to the IRS in the amount of nearly 
$28,000.00, as alleged in the SOR.  By the date of the hearing, Applicant had paid off both his obligation and that of his former wife. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's good faith efforts to 
repay overdue creditors and otherwise resolve his debts clearly fall within MC E2.A6.1.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's finances are presently in good shape--a marked improvement over the way they had been briefly as a result of the business failure and the bankruptcies.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the Government's case with respect to his financial 
considerations.  Accordingly, allegation 1.a. of the SOR is concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER>
