<P>Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola issued a decision, dated April 21, 1999, in which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board
affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge failed to
explain his decision adequately; (2) whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply pertinent
mitigating factors; (3) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that a pattern of
criminal activity existed; and (4) whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply the whole
person concept.</P>

<P><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated
December 11, 1998 to Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion J (Criminal Conduct) and
Criterion E (Personal Conduct).</P>

<P>A hearing was held on March 17, 1999.  The Administrative Judge subsequently issued a
written decision in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on
Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</P>

<P><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></P>

<P>1. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge failed to explain his decision adequately</U>.  Applicant's
brief does not list this as a specific appeal issue.  However, Applicant's brief contains several
arguments that contend the Administrative Judge failed to explain various aspects of his
decision in an adequate manner.  These arguments, taken collectively, raise a serious issue.</P>

<P>Administrative Judges have broad latitude and discretion in how they write their decisions. 
However, that latitude and discretion must be exercised within the legal constraints of the
Directive and basic concepts of due process.<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  A Judge must issue a written decision that sets
forth "pertinent findings of fact, policies, and conclusions as to the allegations in the SOR . . ." 
Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 25.  A Judge's decision must set forth
findings and conclusions with sufficient specificity and clarity that the parties and this Board
can discern what the Judge is finding and concluding.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0476 (July
22, 1999) at p. 4; ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (August 28, 1997) at p. 4.  Furthermore, a Judge
must consider pertinent factors and Adjudicative Guidelines (Directive, Section F.3), and
articulate a rational explanation for any deviations from them.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0507 (May 17, 1999) at p. 6.  Finally, a Judge cannot make rulings or reach conclusions that
are arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item
32.c.  Some actions that would be arbitrary and capricious include: failure to articulate a
satisfactory explanation for conclusions; failure to consider relevant factors; and failure to
consider an important aspect of a case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0331 (May 26, 1999) at p.
6 (discussing arbitrary and capricious standard).  Such failures could be manifested in the form
of an inadequate decision.  <FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nothing in the Directive or general principles of due process
require that a decision be of any particular length.  The issue is not the particular length of a
decision, but whether the decision contains findings, conclusions, and pertinent discussion that
satisfies the requirements of the Directive and due process.  A short decision may be sufficient
to satisfy those requirements while a long decision may fail to do so.</FONT></P>

<P>In view of the foregoing, a decision may be challenged on appeal if it: (a) does not satisfy the
requirements of the Directive; (b) has deficiencies that preclude the parties and this Board from
being able to discern what the Judge is finding or concluding; or (c) it has deficiencies that
render it arbitrary and capricious.  In this case, Applicant challenges the Judge's decision on the
first and third grounds.  As will be discussed later in this decision, the Board concludes
Applicant's arguments have some merit, but that the particular errors identified by Applicant
are harmless and do not warrant remand or reversal under the particular facts of this case.</P>

<P>2. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply pertinent mitigating factors</U>.  Applicant
contends the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary and capricious because the Judge: (a)
did not consider or apply pertinent Section F.3. factors; (b) failed to consider pertinent
Adjudicative Guidelines under Criterion J; and (c) failed to consider pertinent Adjudicative
Guidelines under Criterion E.</P>

<P>(a) The Administrative Judge must consider the six factors listed in Section F.3. of the
Directive, as appropriate to the particular facts of the case.<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  In addition to noting the general
applicability of the Section F.3. factors and listing them (Decision at pp. 3-4), the Judge's
decision touches upon such matters as the nature and seriousness of Applicant's conduct,
including the circumstances surrounding it (Section F.3.a.), the frequency and recency of
Applicant's conduct (Section F.3.b.), Applicant's age (Section F.3.c.), and Applicant's
motivation (Section F.3.d.).  Accordingly, the Board does not find persuasive Applicant's
argument that the Judge failed to consider Sections F.3.a. and F.3.b.  Applicant's ability to
argue for an alternate interpretation or weighing of the record evidence does not demonstrate
the Judge failed to consider those Section F.3. factors.</P>

<P>Applicant correctly notes that the Administrative Judge's decision does not specifically address
the likelihood of recurrence (Section F.3.f.).  At most, the Judge implicitly reached a negative
conclusion about that factor when the Judge stated Applicant did not meet "the mitigating
conditions of . . . Section F.3. of the Directive" (Decision at p. 5).  The Judge's failure to
address Section F.3.f. except in such a perfunctory manner is somewhat problematic. 
However, the Judge's failure to explicitly comment on Section F.3.f. is not harmful error. 
Considering the totality of the record evidence and the Judge's decision in its entirety, there is
not a significant chance that, but for this error, the Judge would have reached a different result. 
Accordingly, a remand is not warranted.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0380 (March 8, 1999) at
p. 4 (discussing harmless error doctrine).</P>

<P>(b) Applicant contends the Administrative Judge's decision is arbitrary and capricious because
the Judge failed to consider pertinent Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions or explain why
he decided not to apply such pertinent Mitigating Conditions.  In support of this contention,
Applicant lists all the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions in his brief and makes a general
assertion that the Judge ignored them.  However, Applicant only makes specific arguments
with respect to the applicability of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> and 2.<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Applicant argues the Administrative Judge should have applied Criminal Conduct Mitigating
Condition 1 because: (i) his April 1998 arrest for disorderly conduct (for soliciting a sex act
from an undercover police officer) occurred approximately one year before the hearing without
any recurrence, and (ii) the Judge did not specifically find that such conduct would be
repeated.  Applicant also cites the Board's decision in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (August 28,
1997) in support of his argument.  Applicant's argument fails to demonstrate the Judge erred
for two reasons.  First, Applicant's argument overlooks the fact that his falsification of a
security questionnaire, which is felonious conduct under 18 U.S.C. Section 1001, occurred in
August 1998.  Accordingly, Applicant's last instance of criminal conduct took place in August
1998, not April 1998.  Second, the Board's decision in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 is
distinguishable on its facts.  In that case, the applicant's last use of marijuana occurred
approximately 17 months before the hearing.  In this case, Applicant's April 1998 disorderly
conduct occurred 11 months before the hearing and his falsification occurred </P>

<P>7 months before the hearing.  Applicant's argument fails to demonstrate the Judge erred by not
applying Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.</P>

<P>Applicant also contends the Administrative Judge should have applied Criminal Conduct
itigating Condition 2.  In support of this contention, Applicant argues: (a) Applicant's
misconduct is the only misconduct he has been involved in during the 13-year period he has
held a security clearance; (b) Applicant has not been involved in any subsequent acts of
misconduct; and (c) it was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to characterize Applicant's
conduct as a "pattern" of ongoing criminal conduct because Applicant's April 1998 disorderly
conduct incident and his August 1998 falsification are "part and parcel of a single event."</P>

<P>Applicant's first and second arguments are not persuasive.  Multiple acts of misconduct are not
"isolated" within the meaning of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 2 merely because
they take place in a short period of time relative to an applicant's life or the time an applicant
holds a security clearance.  Furthermore, multiple acts of misconduct are not "isolated" within
the meaning of that Mitigating Condition merely because an applicant has refrained from
subsequent acts of misconduct.</P>

<P>Applicant's third argument is not so easily disposed of.  On the one hand, it is difficult to
accept Applicant's characterization of his April 1998 disorderly conduct incident and his
August 1998 falsification as "part and parcel of a single event"; they were discrete acts,
involving very different kinds of behavior, separated by a period of just over three months.<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> 
On the other hand, it was a stretch for the Administrative Judge to characterize two very
different acts as a "pattern."  However, the Judge's characterization of Applicant's conduct as a
"pattern" cannot be considered harmful error because it is not outcome determinative under
Criterion J, which covers "[a] history <EM>or</EM> pattern of criminal activity" (italics added).  <EM>See also</EM>
Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 1 ("[A]ny criminal conduct, regardless of whether
the person was formally charged") and Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 2 ("[A]
single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses").<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>  Even in the absence of a pattern of
criminal conduct, a single act of falsification can be sufficient to support an adverse security
clearance decision.  Error in a Judge's decision does not warrant remand when there are
sustainable findings and conclusions in the decision that are sufficient to support the Judge's
overall security clearance decision.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0355 (March 12, 1999) at p. 3
(error by Administrative Judge is harmless when his sustainable findings and conclusions are
sufficient to support his final adverse security clearance decision).</P>

<P>(c) Applicant contends the Administrative Judge failed to consider pertinent Personal Conduct
itigating Conditions.<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A>  Specifically, Applicant contends the Judge ignored application of
Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3.<A HREF="98-0809.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A>  In support of this contention, Applicant argues he
voluntarily corrected his omission of the April 1998 arrest from his August 1998 security
questionnaire when he was interviewed in November 1998.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge did not give any explanation for why he did not apply Personal
Conduct Mitigating Condition 3.  However, considering the record evidence in this case, the
Judge's silence concerning Mitigating Condition 3 is not clearly an error, as Applicant
contends.</P>

<P>Given the Administrative Judge's findings in this case, the Board will not assume the Judge
was unaware of the passage of three months between Applicant's August 1998 falsification and
his November 1998 interview.  In connection with Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3, a
Judge properly may consider the passage of time between an applicant's falsification and the
applicant's later disclosure of the facts to the government.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0595
(May 22, 1998) at p. 4 (not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law for Administrative Judge to
conclude applicant's disclosures in June 1997 interview of facts concealed in January 1997
were not "prompt" within meaning of Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 3).  In that case,
there was a passage of approximately five months between the applicant's falsification and the
applicant's disclosure of the concealed facts.  In this case, there was a passage of three months
between Applicant's falsification and his subsequent disclosures.  Is the two-month difference
legally significant?  The Board has not yet issued a decision that sets forth a "bright line"
definition of "prompt" and it does not propose to do so in this case.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge's failure to discuss Mitigating Condition 3 is troubling.  However,
that failure is not harmful error unless the Board holds, as a matter of law, that the Judge
should have applied Mitigating Condition 3 despite the evidence that: (a) Applicant made no
effort to disclose his concealed arrest until three months after he falsified his security
questionnaire; and (b) even then, Applicant only disclosed his concealed arrest after the
investigator called him to set up an interview, went through the security questionnaire with
him, and then reached the falsified section of the questionnaire.  The Board declines to do so.</P>

<P>3. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that a pattern of criminal activity existed</U>. 
Applicant repeats a variation of his earlier argument concerning the Administrative Judge's
characterization of his conduct as a pattern of criminal activity.  The Board incorporates by
reference its earlier discussion of this issue.</P>

<P>4. <U>Whether the Administrative Judge failed to apply the whole person concept</U>.  Applicant
contends the Administrative Judge failed to apply the whole person concept in this case.  In
support of this contention, Applicant argues: (a) the Judge's decision failed to account for any
favorable mitigating element of Applicant's life; (b) the Judge failed to take into account the
fact that Applicant held a security clearance for over 13 years without a security incident; and
(c) the Judge gave only summary consideration to the declarations by Applicant's supervisors
and colleagues.  None of these arguments demonstrate the Judge erred.</P>

<P>Although an Administrative Judge must consider all the record evidence (Section F.3.), the
Judge is not required to specifically discuss each and every piece of record evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,
ISCR Case No. 98-0247 (January 20, 1999) at p. 2.  Accordingly, error is not demonstrated
merely because Applicant can cite to portions of the record evidence that were not specifically
discussed by the Judge.  Furthermore, the presence of favorable evidence does not compel a
Judge to issue a favorable decision.  The Judge must weigh the record evidence as a whole and
decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See,
e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0614 (July 12, 1999) at p. 3.  The fact that the Judge did not find the
favorable evidence cited by Applicant to be of sufficient weight to warrant a favorable decision
does not mean that the Judge simply failed to consider that evidence.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No.
98-0394 (June 10, 1999) at p. 5.</P>

<P>Furthermore, Applicant's favorable security record weighs in his favor, but it is not dispositive. 
The absence of security violations does not preclude an adverse security clearance decision
based on other grounds, such as criminal conduct or falsification.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0394 (June 10, 1999) at p. 7.</P>

<P>Contrary to Applicant's contention, the Administrative Judge did more than give only summary
consideration to the declarations by Applicant's supervisors and colleagues.  Those
declarations all contains statements that address the security concerns raised by SOR 2.b.  The
Judge's favorable findings and conclusions about SOR 2.b. (including his application of
Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5) indicate the Judge did not simply ignore those
declarations.  The fact that the Judge did not give those declarations more weight with respect
to other aspects of the case does not demonstrate he simply ignored them.</P>
