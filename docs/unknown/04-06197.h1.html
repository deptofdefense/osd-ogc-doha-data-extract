<P>Applicant accumulated numerous debts that were discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He still owes federal and state taxes and a child support arrearage.  He 
was arrested for reckless endangerment for firing a shotgun into the air on the Fourth of July and placed on probation before judgment.  The charges were 
dismissed after he successfully completed his probation, including court-ordered alcohol counseling.  He did not disclose his arrest and alcohol counseling on 
his security clearance application (SF 86).  He rebutted the allegation of falsifying his SF 86, but did not mitigate the security concern based on financial 
considerations.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 18, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny 
Applicant a security clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  Under 
Guideline F, it alleges numerous delinquent debts.  Under Guideline E, it alleges Applicant falsified his SF 86 by answering "no" to questions 26 (arrests or 
convictions not listed elsewhere) and 30 (alcohol-related treatment or counseling).<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 9, 2005.  He admitted some allegations, denied others, and offered explanations.  He requested a hearing, 
and t</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">he case was assigned to me on June 27, 2005.  The hearing was held as scheduled on September 1, 2005, and I kept the record open until September 16, 
2005, to allow both sides to submit additional documentary evidence.  Department Counsel's additional evidence is incorporated in the record as Government 
Exhibit 10.  Applicant's additional documents are incorporated as Applicant's Exhibits C and D.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 16, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my findings of fact.  I also make the following findings:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 47-year-old personnel clerk employed by a defense contractor.  He was married in 1978 and divorced in 1982.  He married his current spouse in 
April 1994.  He testified he had "perfectly good credit" until he was married in 1994.  He testified his wife "don't like to pay bills."  She told him she had paid 
the bills she incurred, and he believed her. <A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Although he agreed his wife's overspending was a significant cause of their financial problems, he was reluctant to 
place the primary blame on her.  He has not resolved the problem caused by his wife's spending habits.  He testified, "[W]hen I tell her about it, she wants to 
start arguing."<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  He has not obtained any financial counseling.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence he cancelled any joint charge accounts, disputed the accounts, or attempted 
to remove his name from them.  His wife is employed intermittently, but suffers from several medical ailments.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant retired from the U.S. Army in 1995 with a disability and was unemployed for more than a year. He lost a finger due to cancer and had difficulty 
finding employment.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He worked as manager of a pizza restaurant from April 1996 until November 1998, and as a state employee from November 1998 until 
arch 2003.  He began working for his current employer in July 2003. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant's medical problems were covered by TRICARE, he stated he could not afford the premiums to cover his spouse and stepson, both of whom 
had recurring medical problems.  At the hearing, Applicant admitted his only uninsured medical expenses were for medications that could not be filled at a 
military pharmacy.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he suffered a mild stroke in November 2004 and was unemployed for "a little while."  At that point, he decided he had 
no choice but to file a petition for bankruptcy.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By January 2005, Applicant had delinquent debts to 10 creditors totaling about $6636.00, including a child 
support arrearage. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2005, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and on August 25, 2005, he received a discharge.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  The schedule of debts in the bankruptcy 
petition includes all debts alleged in the SOR, except two debts totaling about $280.00 and the child support arrearage.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He also owes about $2,100.00 in 
federal taxes and $900.00 in state taxes that were not discharged.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has two children living with him.  He pays child support for a third child and is paying an arrearage for two others.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he is paying 
the child support arrearage by automatic deduction from his pay.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  After the hearing, he furnished copies of pay vouchers reflecting the automatic deduction.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant fired a shotgun into the air on July 4, 2002, to celebrate the holiday.  His wife called the police, thinking Applicant had endangered her son, and 
Applicant was arrested for reckless endangerment.  Applicant testified he had consumed two alcoholic drinks before the incident.  In September 2002, he 
appeared in court and was given probation before judgment.  He was sentenced to a year of supervised probation, a $250.00 fine, 25 hours of community 
service, and 12 weeks of alcohol education classes.  He was diagnosed as having no substance dependency.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He completed all the terms of his probation, and 
the charges were dismissed. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a SF 86 on July 8, 2005.  He responded "no" to question 26, asking if he had any arrests or convictions not listed elsewhere on the form, 
and to question 30, asking if his use of alcoholic beverages had resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling during the past seven years.  In his 
answer to the SOR, he wrote "I admit" under the allegation regarding question 26 and "I deny" under the allegation regarding question 30.  Under both 
allegations he wrote "charges were dropped."  He testified he did not disclose the arrest and alcohol education classes, based on advice from his security 
manager and others, because he did not think it was necessary in light of the verdict of probation before judgment and the eventual dismissal of the charges.<A HREF="04-06197.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two disqualifying conditions (DC) under this guideline could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  DC 1 applies where an applicant 
has a history of not meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness 
to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3.  Applicant's financial history establishes DC 1 and DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Several mitigating conditions (MC) are relevant.  A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing the delinquent debts were not 
recent (MC 1) or an isolated incident (MC 2).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.1., E2.A6.1.3.2.  Applicant had multiple delinquent debts.  Some were resolved by his 
bankruptcy discharge shortly before the hearing, but others have not yet been resolved.  I conclude MC 1 and MC 2 are not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing they are the result of conditions beyond the person's control (MC 3).  Directive 
&para; E2.A6.1.3.4.  Applicant's disability retirement from the Army, his inability to find employment for more than a year, and his wife's inability to work steadily 
because of health problems were conditions beyond Applicant's control.  However, those conditions were only contributing factors.  Applicant's fundamental 
problem was his and his spouse's spending habits.  To the extent Applicant's problems are attributable to his wife's irresponsibility, the record reflects no 
actions by Applicant to restrict or remove her access to charge accounts for which he is jointly liable.  I conclude MC 3 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern arising from financial problems can be mitigated by showing a good-faith effort to resolve debts (MC 6).  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6.  The 
concept of good faith "requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR 
Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure 
of qualifying for a security clearance.  Furthermore, a discharge in bankruptcy does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve a debt, even though it is relevant 
because it makes Applicant less vulnerable to coercion or temptation to engage in illegal conduct to generate funds.  I conclude MC 6 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Even after obtaining a bankruptcy discharge, Applicant still faces significant federal and state tax debts and a child support arrearage.  He has not sought 
financial counseling, and has not demonstrated any change in his financial management.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and 
evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concern based on financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E (Personal Conduct)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l.  DC 2 applies where there has been a 
deliberate omission or falsification of relevant and material facts on any personal security questionnaire.  Directive &para;E2.A5.1.2.2..  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel argued Applicant's failure to disclose his arrest and alcohol counseling shifted the burden to him to explain the omission sufficiently to 
negate a finding of knowing and deliberate falsification, citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004) at 5.  The Appeal Board has rejected this 
interpretation of its decision.<EM> </EM> ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant answered the SOR, he wrote "I admit" under the allegation of falsifying his answer to the question about arrests.  However, I am not satisfied 
he understood he was admitting intentional falsification of the form.  At the hearing he impressed me as somewhat unsophisticated.  He testified he did not 
understand questions 26 and 30.  I am satisfied he knew his answer to the SOR admitted the answer was wrong, but I am not satisfied he knew he was admitting 
intentional falsification.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or 
prove an applicant's intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG> </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An Administrative Judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine 
whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant's intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I found Applicant's explanation of his negative answers on the SF 86 plausible.  After hearing his testimony, observing his demeanor, and evaluating all the 
evidence of record, I found his testimony credible on the falsification issue.  I am satisfied he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86.  Accordingly, I conclude 
DC 2 is not established.</SPAN></P>
