<P>Applicant's alcohol-related arrests in 1981 and 2000 and personal conduct in failing to disclose this adverse information to his supervisor establish security 
concerns.  Applicant continues to drink and failed to provide any documents which show positive changes in his behavior supportive of sobriety.  Doubt 
remains as to whether he is fully rehabilitated given his arrests and  questionable conduct in failing to disclose his 2000  alcohol-related arrest while on 
company business.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on April 29, 2004.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="03-04707.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over Alcohol Consumption (Guideline G) and personal conduct (Guideline E).  (Item 1)  
Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in a notarized Answer dated May 13, 2004, where he admitted all the allegations as well as Additional 
Information; he did not request a hearing. (Item 3)</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel to prepare for a decision on the administrative record.  On August 16, 2004, she prepared the File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) for the Applicant's review and advised Applicant that he had 30 days to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was 
submitted to an administrative judge and that he had the right to be represented by counsel.  She sent the FORM to Applicant advised the Applicant that he had 
30 days from receipt of the letter to submit objections and/or information before the FORM was submitted to an administrative judge. Applicant  received the 
FORM on August 23, 2004.  On September 17, 2004, Applicant requested additional time to submit reference letters.  He submitted two letters dated October 1, 
2004.  On October 13, 2004, Department Counsel indicated she had no objection.  On October19, 2004, the case was assigned to me.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, 51 years old, has been an employee of Defense Contractor #1 in State #1 since 1981.  In June 2002 he submitted a Security Clearance Application 
(Standard Form 86) (SF 86)  (Item 4) Applicant was granted a Secret security clearance in September 1981.  The electronic version of the SF 86 (EPSQ)  is 
dated July 2002.(Item 5)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant received a BA from a university in State #2 in 1978. He married in 1984 and has two children.  (Items 4, 5)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG> <STRONG>and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 2002 EPSQ documents a February 2002 alcohol offense, a DWI (misdemeanor) in State #3.  (Item 5) In his August 2002 interview and statement 
Applicant explained that he was on business with a rental car paid for my his company when he was arrested in State #3 fro DWI.  He spent a night in jail and 
came home; he misrepresented to his supervisor why he came home early and explained he was not feeling well.  He never told his supervisor about this 
incident as he feared that the company would take some type of disciplinary action against him, such as a reprimand or termination.  Since 2000 DWI, he has 
continued to drive his vehicle while legally intoxicated on two occasions; however he was not arrested again.  He claims he does "not have a drinking problem."  
(Item 6) However, the police department offense report documents that he was driving after 10 PM at night with only his parking lights on; there was no 
accident. He told the officers who stopped him that he had only had two beers.  He failed the field sobriety test, he was arrested, and his vehicle was 
impounded.  (Item 7) He admitted he was sentenced to ninety days in jail, suspended, placed on one year of probation, ordered to pay a $500 fine and $225 in 
court costs, and ordered to completed 50 hours of community service and to undergo random uranalysis tests, attend traffic safety education program and 
abstain from alcohol and attend alcohol counseling if warranted by his probation officer.  (Exhibits 1, 3)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant began to drink in 1984 when he went to college. Applicant became depressed when his father died in 1996 and from 1996 to 2000 he drank a few 
beers twice a week and drank to intoxication a few times a year.  Since 2000 he has continued to drink but at a reduced rate.  From 2001 to 2002 he had "a 
couple of beers once every couple of weeks."  At one time his wife considered him an alcoholic, but he never sought any counseling or treatment for alcohol.   
He was arrested in State 1 in 1981 for DWI and resisting arrest; he went to an alcohol awareness class after the 1981 arrest.  He made a decision not to list this 
arrest on his EPSQ as he thought it might make his second DWI arrest "more relevant and standout."  He willfully and intentionally withheld the fact that he 
was arrested in1981 from the government.  (Item 6)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>References</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's manager who has known him for 23 years recommend that he retain his current security clearance; he is highly trust and regarded by his fellow 
employees and his military contacts and foreign customers.  While this manager acknowledges Applicants past "mistakes" he des not explain what they are, <EM>i.e</EM>. 
there is no confirmation he knows about Applicant's 2000 DWI arrest while on a business trip.  (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A team leader who has know Applicant for 18 years recommended that Applicant retain his security clearance as he is highly trusted and regarded highly by his 
fellow employees and his military contacts and foreign customers.  While this supervisor acknowledges Applicants past "mistakes" he does not explain what 
they are, <EM>i.e</EM>. there is no confirmation he knows about Applicant's 2000 DWI arrest while on a business trip.   (Exhibit A)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline G --</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E</STRONG> <STRONG>- Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">       </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has security concerns over Applicant's  alcohol-related arrests: he admits two incidents in 1981 and 2002.  Conditions that could raise a 
security concern and may be disqualifying (DC)<A HREF="03-04707.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> include:  (1)  Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG> </STRONG>(5)  
Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.  His</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> alcohol-related incidents show a pattern even though the two incidents were 
separated by several years.  Despite this pattern of alcohol-related problems, he has yet to make a decision not to drink again and admitted drinking again at 
least twice while intoxicated.  Thus, doubt remains as to whether he is fully rehabilitated.  While he provided favorable supportive evidence from two 
supervisors, they do not discuss any alcohol-related issues so I can give them little weight on the extent of his alcohol concerns especially in light of his 
admissions that he has concealed the 2002 arrest and conviction from them. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">While there is no indication he was ever diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem, he failed to detail any positive changes in behavior which would support a 
basis to mitigate these concerns.  Further, he has made no assertion that he regularly attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or wants to achieve sobriety.  Thus, 
he fails to meet conditions that mitigate<A HREF="03-04707.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> security concerns by showing positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. After considering the Adjudicative 
Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a. through1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant failure to disclose his two DUI arrests raise security concerns over his place his personal concerns ahead of his duty to report adverse information to 
his supervisor.  This personal misconduct raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  (4.)  personal conduct or concealment of information 
that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, 
professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail; and (5.) a  pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any 
written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">To rebut and overcome the Government's case, Applicant would have to demonstrate that he has mitigated<A HREF="03-04707.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> this concern. He had a obligation to disclose 
adverse information to his supervisors; while they endorse him for a security clearance and speak forgivingly of his "past mistakes" it is unclear what they know 
about his misconduct.  Therefore, I can give them little weight.  Further, there is no evidence in the DSS statement that Applicant later made any disclosure 
about the 2001 DWI while on company business. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Hence, none of the mitigating conditions apply. Also, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against 
Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. under SOR Paragraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></CENTER>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
