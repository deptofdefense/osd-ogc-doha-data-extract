<P>In March of 2005, a Licensed Clinical Psychologist issued a provisional diagnosis of the Applicant.  She averred that the Applicant was most likely suffering 
from a Paranoid Personality Disorder, which "condition definitely causes significant defects or likely defects in judgment and reliability," and "is not now in 
remission."  At the Applicant's December 15, 2005, hearing, the same Clinical Psychologist observed the Applicant's demeanor, and reiterated her provisional 
diagnosis.  She averred that the Applicant's condition impacted her reliability, stability, and was continuing in nature.  Mitigation is not shown.  Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 27, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about May 24, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on September 9, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 15, 2005, and the case was heard on December 
15, 2005.  The Government submitted documentary evidence, and called one witness to testify.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted 
documentary evidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on December 29, 2005.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's Personality Disorder 
militates against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant denies the presence of "any emotional, mental or personality disorder."]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">56 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline I - Emotional, Mental and Personality Disorders</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  In March of 2005, a Licensed Clinical Psychologist issued a provisional diagnosis of the Applicant (Government Exhibits (GXs) 6 and 8, <EM>see also</EM> TR at 
page 28 line 18 to page 48 line 17).  She averred that the Applicant was most likely suffering from a Paranoid Personality Disorder, which "condition definitely 
causes significant defects or likely defects in judgment and reliability," and "is not now in remission" (<EM>Id</EM>).  At the Applicant's December 15, 2005, hearing, the 
same Clinical Psychologist observed the Applicant's demeanor, and reiterated her provisional diagnosis.  She averred that the Applicant's condition impacted 
her reliability, stability, and was continuing in nature (TR at page 62 lines 9~17).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Those who know the Applicant and/or work with her think most highly of her (Applicant's Exhibit A).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy 
in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, 
reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her ability to effectively 
safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who suffers from a mental disorder may have a defect in judgement, reliability or stability.  The Government must be able to place a high degree 
of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is suffering from a condition, which, in the opinion of a credentialed mental health professional </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"definitely causes significant defects or likely 
defects in judgment and reliability." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The first disqualifying condition is therefore applicable as there is an "opinion by a credentialed mental health professional 
that the individual has a condition that may indicate a defect in judgement, reliability, and stability."  The Applicant offers little to the contrary, save the 
opinions of those who know her, and say that she is a good person.  Furthermore, according to the clinical psychologist, who observed the Applicant during her 
hearing, the provisional personality disorder is current, and continuing.  Guideline I is thus found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding her personality disorder.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guidelines I, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, she has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline I.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and <STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">supra</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
