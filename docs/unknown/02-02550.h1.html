<P>Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen whose parents and siblings are Pakistani citizens.  Her parents and one of her siblings still reside there.  Applicant also

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 1 May 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-02550.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-02550.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 25 June 
2003 and elected to have her case decided on the record without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on 5 November 
2003.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit 
material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the SOR.  Applicant received the FORM on 17 November 2003 and responded on 25 November 2003.  The case was 
assigned to me on 22 December 2003.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born in Pakistan in 1963.  She immigrated to the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen in 1986.  In 1996 she married a Pakistani citizen.  Applicant and 
her husband had four children, all born in the U.S.  Her husband left her and she was divorced in 2000.  Applicant's parents were born in India, but are citizens 
and residents of Pakistan.  Applicant has two sisters and five brothers; all but one brother are Pakistani citizens.  The other brother is a U.S. citizen.  All of 
Applicant's siblings, except one sister, live in the U.S.  She lives in Pakistan.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant traveled to Pakistan in December 1994 to visit her family due to the illness of one of her relatives.  As her job in the U.S. was terminated, Applicant 
remained in Pakistan until November 1995.  She also visited her family in Pakistan in 1998 for five weeks, 1999 for three weeks, and in 2001 for 10 days.  
Applicant personally financed all of these trips.</P> 
 
<P>The SOR's allegations of financial problems and their current status are summarized in the following chart:</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B-Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant mother, father, and one sister are citizens and residents of Pakistan (&para; 1.a.); her ex-spouse, four brothers. and one sister 
are citizens of Pakistan who reside in the U.S. (&para; 1.b.); and she lived in Pakistan from 26 December 1994 until 5 November 1995 (&para; 1.c.).  A security risk may 
exist when an applicant's immediate family, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the 
U.S. or may be subject to duress.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that members of Applicant's immediate family are citizens of Pakistan and 
some are residents of Pakistan.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  Although Pakistan has aided the U.S. in its fight against international terrorism, it remains a dangerous place.  
Sectarian and separatist terrorists within Pakistan continue to target Americans.  Bombings and assassinations continue to occur throughout the country.  Item 7.  
Although none of her relatives appear to be agents of a foreign power, the fact that her siblings are Pakistani citizens and her parents are citizens and residents 
of Pakistan place Applicant in a position of vulnerability to be influenced by coercive or noncoercive means.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 00628 at 5 (App. B. Feb 24, 
2003).  Applicant's stay in Pakistan from December 1994 until November 1995 is evidence of the close relationship she has with her family and with the nation 
of Pakistan.  There is no evidence Applicant is other than a loyal U.S. citizen.  Nevertheless, she has not overcome the evidence that she is in a position of 
vulnerability to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find against Applicant on &para; 1.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was financially overextended as evidenced by her many delinquent debts (&para;&para; 2.a. - 2.e., 2g., and 2.h.), had an unsatisfied 
judgment (&para; 2.f.), and had her wages garnished for an unpaid debt (&para; 2.i.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal 
acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</P> 
 
<P>The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that she had a history of not meeting hr financial obligations (DC 
E2.A6.1.2.1.) and was unable or unwilling <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to satisfy her debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  Applicant claims her debts were, in large part, attributable to her ex-husband, 
the divorce proceedings, and medical costs-conditions that were largely beyond her control.  MC E2.A6.1.3.3.  Applicant claims she is now debt free.  The 
evidence of record establishes that she had paid off many of the debts, but it is unclear about several others.  Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation 
to show that the debts alleged in &para;&para; 2.b, 2.d., 2.g., and 2.h. have been satisfied or are being satisfied.  Accordingly, I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P>
