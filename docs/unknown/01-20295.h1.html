<P>Applicant's personal conduct and finances continue to raise security concerns over her misuse of a credit card  that belonged to an elderly client on which she 
charged over $5,000 in 1998.  Aggravating this personal misconduct was her forging a letter of reference for herself from her supervisor for which she was 
criminally charged and convicted of a misdemeanor.  While Applicant has mitigated security concerns over this misdemeanor criminal conduct, she still has not 
made full restitution and did not begin to make monthly payments to redress this debt until 2000. While she resolved an outstanding debt to one creditor, she 
has not demonstrated a plan to resolve all her debts nor has she sought counseling to demonstrate that she is gaining control of her finances overall.  Despite her 
remorse, security concerns remain.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on July 30, 2002.  The SOR detailed reasons why the 
Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.<A HREF="01-20295.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>   The SOR alleges specific concerns over criminal conduct (Guideline J) in paragraph 1; over personal conduct (Guideline E) in paragraph 2; and 
over financial issues (Guideline F) in paragraph 3. Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on August 16, 2002, and requested a 
hearing.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel on September 25,2002.  After she stated it was ready to proceed, on October 3, 2002, the case was assigned to 
another administrative judge.  On October 4, 2002, the matter was re-assigned to me.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to and a 
Notice of Hearing issued on October 7, 2002, set the matter for October 22, 2002.  At the hearing the Government introduced 8 exhibits which were admitted 
into evidence. (Exhibits 1-8)  Applicant testified and offered two exhibits (Exhibits A through B) which were admitted into evidence.  The Government's 
request that Applicant be given additional time to submit other information was granted; she had seven additional days until October 29, 2002.  The 
Government was granted two additional days until October 31, 2002, to review her submission.  (TR 48-49, 51-52, 73) The  transcript (TR) was received on 
October 30, 2002.</P> 
<P>Applicant submitted additional records on October 29, 2002 (Exhibits C &amp; D) and requested an additional extension of 14 days to November 12, 2002; as the 
Government did not object, I granted the extension.  On November 13, 2002, she submitted more information by e-mail (Exhibit  E).  On November 18, 2002, 
the Government indicated no objection to these documents; and Exhibits C, D and E were admitted into evidence.  On November 25, 2002, Applicant made an 
additional e-mail submission (Exhibit F).  On November 27, 2002, the Government indicated no objection to the record being re-opened to receive the 
information and made no objection to the information, but requested it be confirmed by a faxed copy and that the record then be closed.  On November 27, 
2002, Applicant faxed the confirmation.   (Exhibit G)  Subsequently, the Government  on December 4, 2002, indicated no objection; and Exhibits F and G were 
admitted and the record closed.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, a 30-year-old employee, works for a defense contractor (Employer #1); from December 1998 to March 1999 she was assigned there by a temporary 
agency and became a permanent employee in March 1999.  In July 1999 she completed a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) and requested a 
security clearance.  She also has worked for Employer #2 as a certified home health aide on the weekends from December 1998 to January 2000.  Previously 
she worked for Employer #3 from July 1997 to October 1998.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 3)  </P> 
<P>Applicant is single and the mother of children born in September 1989 and January 1992.  She receives no child support.  (Exhibit 1; TR 21) </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct, Personal Conduct, and Financial Considerations </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>When Applicant worked for Employer #3 in 1998, she admitted to a private investigator that she fraudulently used a credit card of Creditor #4 that belonged to 
one of the clients and was to be used only to purchase items for that elderly client.    Between July and August 1998 she used the card to purchase items for this 
client; and she also used the credit card to purchase $50 worth of groceries for herself.  Subsequently, she paid the client for the groceries she had purchased.    
Then her supervisor, Ms. V, cut her hours from 90 to 60 hours every two weeks; and she had unexpected car repairs.  In August 1998 Applicant fraudulently 
used the card to purchase school clothes and necessities for her children in the amount of $200-300 on several occasions.  She also purchased clothes for 
herself, a VCR and a stereo.  The amount totaled over $5,000 over two months.  Applicant stated her intent was to repay the client when she had another job.  
When her sister and boyfriend questioned her about the purchases, she stopped using the card in mid-September 1998 when the client moved out of the area.  In 
October 1998 after getting the credit card bill with unusually high amounts, the client's son contacted the Employer #3 supervisor.  The supervisor hired a 
private investigator to interview everyone who had access to the card.  In late October 1998 Applicant was interviewed about the charges and admitted to 
making these charges; and she then left the office and employment of Employer #3.  She states she went to the police department voluntarily and also admitted 
to a police officer that she made the fraudulent charges.  She states that the police officer advised her that she did not have to list this incident on her 
employment documents as she was never charged or convicted of any offense.   Applicant admits she was wrong to misuse the credit card.  She offered to make 
restitution for the charges.  Creditor #4 held her liable for all of the charges made on the charge card which totaled over $8,000.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 6, 7; TR 
20-21, 26-27; 38-45, 47-48)</P> 
<P>While Creditor #4 stated Applicant was arrested in 1998 for theft and usage of the credit card, the local police report in their files shows that the case was 
closed with no prosecution of Applicant.  In December 1999 a balance of over $8,000 remained, but no restitution had been made.  (Exhibits 6, 7)  In 2000 
Applicant began making monthly payments of $114.  (Discussed below.)  (TR 48)</P> 
<P>After leaving her job with Employer #3, Applicant had difficulty getting another job as she could not use Ms. V as a reference.  To help her get employment, 
she wrote her own reference letter which listed her job duties with Employer #3; and she forged Ms. V's signature.  She obtained their letterhead from papers 
that she had at home during her employment there.  In November 1998 she gave this letter to a doctor who called Ms. V in reference to the letter.  He sent Ms. 
V the letter, and Ms. V pressed charges against the Applicant, who had listed her pager number on the forged reference letter.  Applicant went to the police 
station and was charged with forgery; however in December 1998 the municipal court charged her with a lesser offense, disorderly person misconduct to which 
she pled guilty in January 1999.  She paid a $200 fine plus court costs and fees of $80 in April 1999.    She listed this disorderly person misdemeanor charge in 
her SF 86 in response to Question 26 asking about her police record.  She did not list the arrest for forgery as she thought she only needed to list the final 
conviction.  Applicant claimed to have had no malicious intent by actions as she was seeking a job to support her children.  Further, she voluntarily discussed 
her entire background with the Defense Security Service agent when she was interviewed.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 4, 5; TR 26-38, 46-47)</P> 
<P>Applicant also disclosed some financial difficulties in the SF 86.  In December 1999 she provided a financial statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS) 
which showed monthly net income of approximately $2,900, monthly expenses of approximately $1,500 and debt payments of approximately $500 (including a 
monthly car payment of $357 on a $18,500 auto debt).  She has paid off debts to several other creditors which she has been paying off one by one. (Exhibit A; 
TR 21-23, 49-51) </P> 
<P>She now works at Company #1 as a full-time employee and also has a part-time job on Saturday and Sunday with another company.  (TR 52-54)  She no longer 
works as a home health aid.  (TR 54)  She sought financial counseling once, but could not afford the charges for the debt counseling service.  (TR 54-55) She 
submitted a list of her income and monthly expenses.  In October 2002 her monthly net income was approximately $2,700; she is enrolled in school and has 
tuition payments as well as her regular monthly payments.  She is enrolled in a program called "clear credit" to monitor her credit and pays $40 monthly for 
their service.  (Exhibit C)</P> 
<P>The SOR alleged four debts:</P> 
<UL> 
  <LI>Applicant has a debt of $425 to Creditor #1 (SOR 3.a.), which was charged off as a bad debt in June 2002.   Applicant reached a settlement with them and 
agreed to pay them $106 in November and again in December 2002 to settle this debt. (Answer; Exhibit 8; Exhibits F, G)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant has a debt of $1,304 to Creditor #2 (SOR 3.b.), which was delinquent and submitted for collection in June 2002.   Applicant admits she is 
delinquent as she has been paying off other accounts.  (Answer; Exhibit 8)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant has a debt of $610 to Creditor #3 (SOR 3.c.), which was charged off as a bad debt in June 2002.   Applicant admits she is delinquent as she has 
been paying off other accounts.  (Answer; Exhibit 8)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant has a debt of over $8,000 to Creditor #4 (SOR 3.d).  By December 1999 she had not made any payment arrangements.   Applicant owed this 
amount from the 1998 fraudulent use of the client's credit card.  She contacted them in January 2000 and has made payments of $114 monthly for the past 
two years.  In October 2002 Applicant had a current balance of $5,400 with Creditor #4.  (Answer; Exhibits 2, 6, 7, 8; TR 21, 47-48; Exhibits C, E)</LI> 
<P>Applicant is enrolled in a college program and has received grades of A and B+ for her Summer 2002 courses.  (TR 56-57; Exhibit D) </P> 
<P>Applicant has not been involved in any subsequent criminal conduct since the incidents in 1998.  She has a support network and now would turn to them for 
help.  She states she would never repeat her past questionable conduct.  (TR 56-57)</P>

<P>Applicant's supervisor stated that she has worked for Company #1 since March 1999 and has been "an outstanding employee, performing her duties diligently

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a 
consideration of the evidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline F - Financial Considerations </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often linked to 
proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </P>

<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's 1998 conduct where she forged a letter of reference led to a criminal charge and a misdemeanor conviction that raises security concerns.  Applicant 
claimed to have had no malicious intent by actions as she was seeking a job to support her children.  Despite the seriousness of this criminal conduct, she has 
mitigated<A HREF="01-20295.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> those concerns because of the passage of time and by her subsequent good conduct which demonstrates clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  
This qualitative change for the better is established by the positive character reference of excellent performance on the job and by her sincere remorse and 
resolve never to repeat this criminal conduct.  </P> 
<P>Applicant's supervisor stated that she was worked for Company #1 since March 1999 and has been "an outstanding employee, performing her duties diligently 
and in a professional fashion that meets or exceeds her job requirements."  She is viewed as a "valued employee."   Thus, after considering the Appendix I 
Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 1.a. under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In August 1998 Applicant used a client's credit card fraudulently to purchase not only school clothes and necessities for her children but also clothes for herself, 
a VCR, and a stereo.  The amount totaled over $5,000 over two months.  While she claimed her intent was to repay the client when she had another job, she did 
not do so.  In October 1998 the client's son contacted her supervisor after getting the credit card bill with high amounts.  The supervisor hired a private 
investigator to interview everyone who had access to the card.  In late October 1998 Applicant was interviewed about the charges and admitted misusing the 
client's credit card with which she had been entrusted.  </P> 
<P>Aggravating this personal misconduct was her subsequent decision to forge a letter of reference for herself from this supervisor.  She was criminally charged 
with forgery and convicted of a misdemeanor.  This personal conduct is of concern as such conduct could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard 
classified information as she has put her own interest ahead of a duty to be trustworthy.  Conditions pertinent to this case that could raise a security concern and 
may be disqualifying include:  (1)  reliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances and (5), 
a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.</P> 
<P>Applicant showed questionable judgment in her dealings with her client and with Employer #3 as alleged in subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.  I conclude these 
incidents with Employer #3 showed poor judgment as Applicant abused her position of trust with her client and with her employer.  While Applicant states in 
justification that her supervisor, Ms. V, had cut her hours from 90 to 60 hours every two weeks and that she had unexpected car repairs, these financial 
pressures are not a basis to mitigate her personal misconduct.  Her credit card charges included not just items to benefit her children, but also electronics and 
other items to benefit herself.  These acts are so serious that they cannot be excused by Applicant's subsequent statements of remorse.  While she stated in 1998 
she would make restitution, she did not begin to do so until 2000 and still has a substantial debt of over $5,000 to Creditor #4.  This pattern of rules violations 
show her propensity to put her personal interest above her fiduciary interest to her client and her employer.  Security clearance decisions are predictive 
judgments about an applicant's security eligibility in light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 
518, 528-29 (1988).  </P> 
<P>While I have balanced her misconduct in 1998 with her remorse and her current excellent job performance, nevertheless I conclude this pattern of dishonesty 
remains of sufficient gravity to endure as a security concern.  Consequently, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. and 2.b. under Paragraph 2.</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant has (1) a history of financial problems which led to questionable personal and criminal misconduct (discussed above) and she has continued to show 
(3) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  She provided no evidence of her efforts to resolving the debts to Creditors #2 and #3.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(SOR 3.b and 3.c.)  </SPAN> 
Security concerns persist over her failure to pay her debts.</P> 
<P>While Applicant has a stable job where she is highly regarded, she has a mistaken belief that  her  limited income prevents her from having a budget.  She 
provided updated information on her income and expenses which is fragmentary; thus it is not clear whether or not she is now able to live within her  income.  
Neither  has she demonstrated that she sought financial counseling for help with her financial issues.  While  Applicant has demonstrated she is now financially 
more responsible, her financial situation is still questionable; she is unable to meet mitigating condition 4:  The person has received or is receiving counseling 
for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.  </P> 
<P>On the other hand, Applicant has made some progress on some of her debts. Applicant demonstrated she met some of the mitigating conditions (MC<A HREF="01-20295.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>). By 
finally resolving the matter with Creditor #1, she was able to demonstrate she meets the "good faith" standard in repaying that overdue creditor.   However, she 
provided no evidence on the status of Creditors #2 and #3.  Further, while as a single mother she faced economic pressures, they are not sufficient to meet 
mitigating condition 3: the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).  Security concerns remain over the way the 1998 financial pressures led to her personal 
misconduct, discussed above.   Also, while she promised in 1998 to make restitution to Creditor #4, she did not develop a payment plan with Creditor #4 until 
2000 and still owes over $5,000.  Thus, after considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on 
subparagraph 3.a.. as I conclude that she has mitigated that concern, but against her under subparagraphs SOR 3.b., 3. c., and 3.d. under SOR Paragraph 3.</P>
