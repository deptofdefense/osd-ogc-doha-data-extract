</P>

<P>	On October 15, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR) to -----------------------  (Applicant), which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance
should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 11, 1996.  This case was
assigned to the undersigned on December 31, 1996,  and a Notice of Hearing was issued on January
3, 1997.  </P>

<P>	A hearing was held on February 25, 1997, at which the Government presented nine
documentary exhibits.  The Applicant submitted three documentary exhibits, and she testified on her
own behalf.  </P>

<P>	The official transcript was received on March 11, 1997.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant is forty-seven years old and married.  She is employed by a defense contractor
as a Lead Electronic Technician, and she is applying for a Secret level security clearance in
connection with her employment.</P>

<P>	The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of
allegations set forth in the attached Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are
entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR:</P>

<P><U>Paragraph 1 (Criterion H - Drug Involvement)</U>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is
ineligible for clearance because she abuses illegal substances.</P>

<P>	The Applicant has admitted to abusing heroin, at times daily, from about 1966, to at least
1994.  The Applicant has also used cocaine in 1966, and again for a three month period in 1988. 
(See, Applicant's Answer to SOR).</P>

<P>	In early 1960, the Applicant was introduced to a variety of illegal drugs.  She met a man who
used heroin on a daily basis, and started using it herself in 1966.  By 1969, she was engaging in
prostitution to help supply her habit.  By 1970, she was addicted to heroin, and was using it on a
daily basis.  The Applicant's heroin addiction grew, and by 1974, she was spending about $200.00
a day to supply her heroin habit.  From 1974 until 1991, the Applicant continued to finance her
addiction  by engaging in prostitution, off and on.</P>

<P>	The Applicant stated that from 1969 through 1975, she became entrenched in heroin, and
stopped using all other substances.  From the age of twenty until about twenty-six she traveled
through life, indifferent as to any thoughts of the future.  "I did not work, nor did I maintain any
family contacts.  I lived for the day, for the drug, anywhere and with anyone I could.  My memory
of this period is sketchy at best.  The closest I can come to the truth is that I was at the bottom of a
dark pit and had not yet begun to climb out."  (See, Government Exhibit 3).</P>

<P>	In her attempts to stop using heroin and get well, the Applicant entered a number of different
ethadone Maintenance Treatment Programs.  Methadone Maintenance Treatment is a recognized
and accepted form of heroin rehabilitation.  The Applicant explained that the treatment works by
bringing a person who is out of control into control by giving them a drug (methadone), which takes
the craving for heroin away.  (Tr. Pg. 52).  The Applicant went through periods of trial and error, but
eventually learned that as long as she was taking the methadone, she was able to stay off of heroin. 
However, she also found that as she detoxed off of the methadone, she would return to using heroin.</P>

<P>	The Applicant entered her first Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program in 1980-1981.</P>

<P>In July 1984, the Applicant started another Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program, a twenty-one day in-patient treatment program, followed by an out-patient program until April 1986.  (See,
Government Exhibit 7).  From October 24, 1986, until November 7, 1986; December 31, 1986 to
January 20, 1987; and February 3, 1988 to June 20, 1988; the Applicant underwent outpatient
detoxification services, and was administered methadone to stay off of the heroin.  (See, Government
Exhibits 4 and 8).  From September 14, 1993, to October 11, 1994, the Applicant participated in
another Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program.  (See, Government Exhibit 6).</P>

<P>	Although there were other episodes of relapse, the Applicant testified that she experienced
three major setbacks in her attempts to kick her heroin habit.  In 1978, she relapsed when she was
taking care of her mother, who was dying of cancer.  After her mother died, the Applicant was
severely depressed, and started drinking heavily, which led to heroin.  The Applicant explained that
she would try to detox, but when she saw a problem, she would run back to the heroin.  (Tr. Pg. 63). 
Then, in 1988, at the height of her addiction, she lost her job because she was back on heroin.  At
this point, the Applicant had no hope and felt like giving up on trying to salvage her life.  Eventually,
she picked herself up, went back on the methadone, and stopped using heroin.  </P>

<P>	In 1991, the Applicant relapsed again, but went right back to her Methadone Maintenance
Treatment Program.  She worked the program continuously until 1994, when she slipped again.  </P>

<P>	The Applicant began her most recent Methadone Maintenance Treatment Program on
November 21, 1994.  Since then, she has also received monthly individual counseling sessions.  The
Applicant is presently lowering her dosage of methadone, and will continue to work towards that
goal.  (See, Applicant's Exhibit B).  The Applicant intends to stay on the methadone medication and
in treatment for the rest of her life if necessary.  (Tr. Pg. 65). The Applicant has not used any heroin
since November 1994, and has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug again. </P>

<P>	Over the twenty-four year period that the Applicant used heroin, she was arrested on ten
separate occasions for drug related offenses.  Most of the arrests resulted in her conviction, and she
was either sentenced to jail, fined, or both.  (See, Government Exhibit 9).  </P>

<P>	The Applicant was arrested on April 28, 1968, for (1) Track Marks, and (2) Possession of
Dangerous Drugs.  The charges were subsequently dismissed.</P>

<P>	 On October 28, 1968, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Suspicion of a Felony, (2) Track
arks, and (3) Possession of a Dangerous Drug.  The charges were subsequently dismissed.</P>

<P>	On July 24, 1974, the Applicant was arrested on for (1) Under the Influence of Drugs, (2)
Possession of Heroin, and (3) Possession of Drug Paraphernalia.   </P>

<P>	On July 4, 1975, the Applicant was arrested, for Being Under the Influence of Narcotics
(addict).  The Applicant was sentenced to twenty-five days in jail.</P>

<P>	On August 1, 1975, the Applicant was arrested, for (1) Under the Influence of Heroin, (2)
Soliciting for Prostitution, and (3) Failure to Appear.   </P>

<P>	On August 20, 1975, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Failure to Appear, and (2) Being
Under the Influence of Narcotics.    </P>

<P> </P>

<P>	On December 26, 1988, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Under the Influence of a
Controlled Substance (heroin), and (2) Giving False Identification to a Peace Officer.  The Applicant
pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to serve 180 days in jail, and placed on probation for two years. </P>

<P>	On December 19, 1989, the Applicant was arrested for (1) Possession of Bad Check/Money
Order, (2) Contempt of Court for Disobeying Court Order, (3) Contempt of Court for Disobeying
a Court Order,  (4) Giving False Identification to Peace Officer, and being (5) Under the Influence
of a Controlled Substance (heroin).  The Applicant was sentenced to serve 90 days in jail. </P>

<P>	On February 25, 1991, the Applicant was arrested for being Under the influence of a
Controlled Substance (heroin).  The Applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 365 days in jail. 
</P>

<P>	On May 12, 1991, the Applicant was arrested for being (1) Under the Influence of a
Controlled Substance (heroin), and (2) Giving False Identification to a Peace Officer.  The Applicant
pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 365 days in jail.</P>

<P>	As a result of a felony probation violation in about 1977, the Applicant was sent to prison
for almost one year, where she had time to reflect on her life.  It was in prison that she decided that
she was going to change her life around.  At that point, the Applicant's desire to defeat her addiction
became the major focus of her life.  She also took electronic classes and learned to repair televisions
in prison.  </P>

<P><U>Mitigation.</U></P>

<P>	Four letters of reference from the Applicant's supervisors, coworkers and friends, aver that
the Applicant is a hard worker who is extremely honest, trustworthy, and reliable.  She is also
considered to be a valuable asset to the company, and has recently received a promotion.  (See,
Applicant's Exhibit A).  </P>

<P>	A letter from the Applicant's substance abuse counselor indicates that the Applicant has in
fact been on methadone maintenance treatment for almost three years without any illicit drug use,
and has begun a slow taper program.  Her counselor also feels that she should remain on methadone
maintenance until zero incidence of relapse is indicated.  (See, Applicant's Exhibit B).</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of
Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could
raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security
clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent
criterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any
case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on her own common sense. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be
assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case. 
Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this
case are:</P>

<P><U><CENTER>Criterion H (Drug Involvement)</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1) any drug abuse;</P>

<P>	(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, proceeding, manufacture, purchase , sale
or distribution.</P>

<P><U>Condition that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(3) a demonstrated intent not to use illegal drugs in the future.</P>

<P>	In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at page 2-1,  "In evaluating the
relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general
factors:</P>

<P>	 a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</P>

<P>	b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P>

<P> </P>

<P>	c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>	d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>	e.  The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>	f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P>

<P>	g.  The motivation for the conduct </P>

<P>	h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P>

<P> 	i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence."</P>

<P>	The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and
conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order
10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request
for access to classified information.</P>

<P>	The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period
of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these
personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of
variables known as the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The
Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical
basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in
Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be a determination in terms of
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant
concerned."</P>

<P><STRONG><U><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In DOHA cases the Government has the initial burden to go forward with <EM>prima facie</EM>
evidence in support of the factual and conclusionary allegations in the SOR.  If the Government
meets this initial obligation, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's
<EM>prima facie</EM> case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly
consistent with the interests of national security to grant him or her a security clearance.</P>

<P>	In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian
workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. 
The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an
Applicant for clearance may be involved in repeated instances of off-duty illegal drug abuse which
demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</P>

<P>	Furthermore, the Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security
clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an
Applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in her private affairs, then there exists the
possibility that he or she may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</P>

<P>	In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by <EM>prima facie</EM> evidence
that the Applicant has used illegal drugs (Criterion H).  The Applicant, on the other hand, has
introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome
the Government's <EM>prima facie</EM> case against her. </P>

<P>	Drug abuse is defined as the illegal or improper use, possession, transfer, sale or addiction
to any controlled or psychoactive substance, narcotic, cannabis or other dangerous drug.  The
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide
by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.  If an Applicant has demonstrated
a lack of respect for the law in her private affairs, then there exists the possibility that an Applicant
may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.  </P>

<P>	In this case, the Applicant abused heroin and cocaine and became addicted to them.  I find
that the Applicant's fairly recent extensive drug abuse is incompatible with the Applicant's security
responsibilities.  This is so because of the obvious potential for an unauthorized disclosure of defense
secrets resulting from neglect or misadventure caused by the abuse of illegal drugs.  </P>

<P>	With respect to the Applicant's cocaine use which occurred in 1966, over thirty years ago,
and in 1988, over nine years ago, it has not been repeated.  I find that the cocaine use is in the distant
past, and is no longer of security significance.  Accordingly, allegation 1.m., is found for the
Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Applicant, however, has not successfully mitigated the Government's case.  Given the
Applicant's long history of heroin addiction, occurring over a twenty-eight year period, and her
series of unsuccessful attempts to stop using the drug, I am not convinced that the Applicant has
once and for all beaten the addiction.  The Applicant's most recent relapse occurred in November
1994, less than three years ago.  Prior to that she relapsed in 1991.  The Applicant's testimony is
credible, and so is her desire and intent to remain drug free.  However, battling the addiction to
heroin is obviously no easy chore, and additional time in rehabilitation would more amply guarantee
the Government that the Applicant has in fact finally conquered her addiction.</P>

<P>	Assuming the Applicant continues to follow her prescribed treatment program, and in fact
remains completely clean from heroin, or any other illicit drug, she is not precluded from reapplying
for a security clearance in the future.  However, at this time it is much too early in her rehabilitation
to ensure that she will not return to her old habits.  The Applicant has only been completely drug free
for shortly less than three years.  The Applicant is commended for her efforts at turning her life
around, and is encouraged to continue working towards a complete drug free lifestyle.  It is evident
that she has worked very hard to get to this point, and she has made significant progress toward
showing that she can be trusted.  However, at this time she does not meet the eligibility requirements
for access to classified information.  Accordingly, Criterion H is found against the Applicant.  </P>

<P>	On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not overcome the Government's <EM>prima
facie</EM> case opposing her request for a continued security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence
supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed
in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.</P>
