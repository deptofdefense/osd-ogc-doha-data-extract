<P>The fact that applicant was convicted of multiple crimes and sentenced to multiple prison terms exceeding one year precludes him from receiving a security 
clearance under 10 U.S.C. 986. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>On December 21,  2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for applicant 
and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 7, 2002, and elected to have his case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department 
Counsel submitted the Government's written case (FORM) on or about April 10, 2002. Applicant filed a response to the FORM on May 15, 2002. Department 
Counsel did not object to applicant's response. The case was assigned to me on May 31, 2002.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 42 year old employee of a defense contractor.</P> 
<P>In December 1998, applicant was charged in State A with (1) Child Abuse by a Parent, (2) two counts of Rape, second degree, (3) two counts of Sex Offense, 
third degree, (4) two counts of Sex Offense, fourth degree, and (5) two counts of Assault, second degree. These charges were based upon criminal and sexually 
perverted conduct applicant engaged in with his minor daughter in December 1996. He pleaded guilty to one count of Sex Offense, fourth degree, and one count 
of Assault, second degree. In March 2000, he was sentenced to a total of eight years in jail, with all but eighteen months suspended. Applicant spent more than 
one year in jail, part of which was spent in a work release program.</P> 
<P>In January 1999, applicant was indicted in State B on the following charges involving the same minor daughter: (1) Statutory Rape, (2) Felonious Incest, and (3) 
Indecent Liberties with a Child. These charges were based upon criminal and sexually perverted conduct occurring between 7/1/98 and 8/30/98. Applicant 
pleaded guilty to Felonious Incest and Indecent Liberties with a Child, and in August 2000, he was sentenced to two terms of 21 to 26 months in jail. The jail 
time was suspended for five years pending the successful completion of five years of supervised probation. Applicant was also ordered to pay restitution of 
$4,500.00 and court costs of $131.00.</P> 
<P>Despite his guilty pleas, applicant denies that he ever engaged in criminal or sexually perverted conduct with his minor daughter. In a signed, sworn statement 
that he gave to the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) in September 2001, he stated the following:</P> 
<P>"I plea bargained in both jurisdictions . . . because I weighed my options and found that it was the lessor of two evils. I did not want to plead my case in front of 
a jury of 12 when it would have been my word against my teen-age daughter. I knew sentiment would be bias in her favor. My attorney also told me I would 
receive no jail time if I accepted the plea bargain, which turned out not to be the case."</P> 
<P>At the time his criminal charges were pending, applicant was serving in the military reserves. In a letter to a superior, applicant characterized the criminal 
proceedings he was involved in as "domestic in nature," apparently in an attempt to remain eligible for a promotion. Applicant's description of the court 
proceedings was clearly misleading and was designed to conceal the true nature of the matter before the court. This intentional misrepresentation to his military 
superiors constitutes a violation of 18 U.S.C.1001, a felony.</P> 
<P>The October 9, 2001 memorandum that applicant attached to his SOR answer rebuts the allegation that he was administratively discharged from the military 
reserves in June 2001.</P> 
<P> A January 16, 2002 letter from one of applicant's supervisors was attached to applicant's SOR answer. In it, the supervisor describes applicant as an 
"outstanding professional" with "the highest moral standard" who is very deserving of a security clearance.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth Guidelines (divided into conditions that could raise security concerns and conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns) which must be followed by the Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Guidelines are applicable:</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>1.2.1: Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless</P> 
<P>of whether the person was formally charged.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>1.2.2: A single serious crime or multiple lessor offenses.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Sexual Behavior</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>1.2.1: Sexual behavior of a criminal nature.</P> 
<P>1.2.4: Sexual behavior which reflects lack of discretion or judgment.<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Disqualifying Conditions</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Mitigating Conditions</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>None.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The evidence establishes that following investigations in two different states, applicant was charged with and convicted of serious crimes involving the sexual 
abuse of his minor daughter. The evidence further establishes that the court in each state sentenced applicant to a jail term exceeding one year. Each sentence, 
standing alone, bars applicant from receiving a security clearance under 10 U.S.C. 986.</P> 
<P>Even in the absence of 10 U.S.C. 986, applicant would not be eligible for a security clearance at the present time. His criminal and sexually perverted conduct 
with his minor daughter raises too many doubts about his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness under Guidelines D and J, and his intentional 
misrepresentation of material facts in his letter to his military superiors raises too many doubts about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, honesty, and 
candor under Guideline E. Applicant has not only failed to remove these doubts, he has compounded them by denying he engaged in any inappropriate conduct 
with his daughter and by denying he intentionally tried to mislead his military superiors.<A HREF="01-17357.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>In view of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant applicant a security clearance at the present time. </P>
