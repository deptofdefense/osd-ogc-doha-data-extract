<P>Applicant's history of financial difficulties makes him unsuitable for a security clearance. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 23 June 2005 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of financial considerations.<A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR in August 2005 and requested a decision on the record..  He did not respond to 
DOHA's 22 September 2005 File of Relevant Material (FORM). DOHA assigned the case to me 7 November 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add subparagraph 1.o., a charged-off account that first appeared on Applicant's August 2005 
credit report. The record evidence supports the amendment and, accordingly, I grant the motion. Applicant having not responded to the FORM, I formally enter 
his denial of the allegation, consistent with his answer to the original SOR.         </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied the allegations of the SOR. He is a 38-year-old creative director employed by a defense contractor since February 2001. He seeks to retain the 
clearance he has held since approximately September 1995. He submitted his clearance application for periodic reinvestigation in November 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to at least 1996. He attributes his financial problems to his 1994 marriage to a woman who turned 
out to be a compulsive shopper, suffering from both bipolar disorder and ADHD. Their finances deteriorated so quickly that they filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy 
petition and were discharged from $62,000.00 in debt in September 1996. Applicant had an automobile repossessed in January 1997 and had his wages 
garnished in January 1998. In December 2001, Applicant's employer notified the government that the creditor at 1.l. had filed a garnishment order to recover 
their judgment, plus interest and fees, totaling over $15,000.00. Applicant and his wife separated in October 2000 and have since divorced.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges fifteen delinquent accounts totaling nearly $34,000.00, falling delinquent between October 1997 and August 2005. Over $21,000.00 of that 
amount is for an automobile loan first reported delinquent in August 2005. The fifteen debts are supported by four credit reports obtained between November 
2001 and September 2005. Some of the accounts are reflected as individual accounts; some as joint accounts. With the exception of the debt at 1.o., Applicant 
denies the remaining debts as either paid previously or the responsibility of his ex-wife. However, he has not provided documentation of paid accounts, divorce 
records showing allocation of marital debt, or any evidence of his efforts to remove erroneous entries from his credit report.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established a Guideline F case, and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns.  Government records reflect a large amount of delinquent 
debt acquired after Applicant's bankruptcy discharge in 1996.<A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial 
difficulties are both recent<A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and not isolated;<A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> indeed they appear to be ongoing, with a new delinquent account in August 2005. Although they may have been 
due somewhat to circumstances beyond his control,<A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> there is no evidence that Applicant has sought credit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under 
control.<A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Finally, Applicant provided no evidence to support his assertions that these accounts were either paid or that he had been relieved of the legal 
obligation for the accounts. <A HREF="04-08086.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
