<P>In 1993, Applicant was arrested and convicted of Driving While Intoxicated (DWI).  He was required to attend a DWI course which he did not complete until 
2004. He made a number of statements indicating the matter had been resolved, even though a warrant was still outstanding. The record evidence mitigates the

</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 27, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="02-22025.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On June 17, 2004, 
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On October 2004, I was assigned the case. On  November 10, 2004, I convened a hearing in this matter. 
On November 17, 2004, the transcript (tr.) of the hearing was received.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents, which were received on November 17, 2004. Department Counsel having no 
objection, the documents were admitted into evidence as Applicant's Exhibit (App Ex B). </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct. The Applicant admits to the following: he was arrested in 1993 and charged with DWI and a 
warrant was issued for failure to appear. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After thorough review of the whole record, I make the 
following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is  44 years old, has worked for a defense contractor since May 1995, and is seeking to obtain security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1978, Applicant was arrested for DWI after he had an accident while driving drunk.  The accident resulted in Applicant having surgery and part of his skull 
was removed. He pleaded nolo contendere to the charge. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 1993, Applicant was arrested for DWI after his car hit a stop sign. He had been drinking at a farewell party prior to leaving the state. He was found 
guilty, fined $400, and ordered to attend a DWI course in State 1. In May 1993, Applicant moved to another state, State 2. His move was delayed so he could 
appear in court for the DWI arrest. After paying the $400 fee, it was agreed he could attend the DWI program in State 2. In May 1994, a warrant was issued for 
his failure  to appear in State 1. (Government Exhibit, Gov Ex 5)  In May 1995, Applicant moved to State 3. In August 1995, Applicant gave a signed, sworn 
statement (Gov Ex 4) wherein he said he had not yet attended the DWI school, but had made arrangement to take that course.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2003, Applicant gave a signed, sworn statement (Gov Ex 3) wherein he stated he had not attended a DWI program and assumed the $400 fee covered 
all his court imposed requirements.  In the same sworn statement Applicant states that in May 2000, when he attempted to change his address on his State 3 
driver's license he was informed there was an outstanding warrant from State 1. He was "provided information regarding whom to contact in [State 1], and I 
sent the appropriate agency the required fee of about $100 to clear the warrant." (Gov Ex 3) In his March 2003 statement he said he would make arrangements 
to fulfill the requirements to satisfy the warrant, if the warrant was not already satisfied. Applicant contacted State 1 and was told he needed to send $100 
because of the DWI. (Tr. 35) When he sent the money, he assumed the matter was closed. Applicant now lives in State 4.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 2004, Applicant completed an interrogatory wherein he states, "I was not aware of a warrent [sic], till I received this, but I did have my license 
suspended also, that is why I thought it was corrected . . ." (Gov Ex 2)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In April 2004, Applicant paid $65 and attended a three-day DWI school in State 4. (App Ex A). As of September 2004, the warrant was still outstanding. (Gov 
Ex 5) &nbsp;In November 2004, Applicant contacted State 1 and provided a copy of his certificate for the DWI course. He was told the judge would be contacted to 
have the warrant removed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against 
clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Criminal Conduct, Guideline J. Under Guideline J, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal activity creating doubt about his judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. In 1993, Applicant was arrested and convicted of DWI. Applicant's conduct is aggravated because it took him 10 years before he completed 
the required DWI course. Because of this incident, Disqualifying Condition (DC ) 1. (E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless 
of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) and 2. (E2.A10.1.2.2. <EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>) apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His arrest and conviction occurred in 1993, which </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was 11 years before the hearing. This behavior is not recent. MC 1 (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A10.1.3.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> <EM>The criminal behavior 
was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>.</EM>) applies.  I find for Applicant as to criminal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations under Guideline E, (Personal Conduct) are unfounded.  The Government has shown Applicant's statements were incorrect, but this does not 
prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about a warrant. The Applicant has denied intentional falsification.  Deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance is a 
security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1995, Applicant made a statement he had not taken the required DWI course, but had arranged to do so. The course was not completed until 2004. In 2000, 
Applicant learned there was an outstanding warrant from State 1 when he attempted to change his address on his State 3 driver's license. Applicant contacted 
the appropriate agency, sent them $100, assumed the matter was closed and the warrant cleared. In March 2004, Applicant completed an interrogatory wherein 
he stated he was unaware the outstanding warrant had not been cleared until he received the interrogatory. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has shown Applicant stated the warrant had been cleared when it was still outstanding, but this does not prove the Applicant deliberately 
provided false information about the warrant. Applicant believed his statements were true. In 2000, when informed there was an outstanding warrant he 
contacted the appropriate agency, paid $100, and thought the matter was resolved. He believed the matter was closed. His 2003 and 2004 statements reflect this 
belief.  When told in 2004, the warrant was still outstanding, he said he was unaware of a warrant.  Actually, he knew a warrant had previously existed, but as 
of 2004 he thought it had been cleared, and said so, "I thought it was corrected." It would have been more accurate for Applicant to have said he was unaware 
the warrant was "still outstanding," until he was told of its existence when he received the interrogatory. There is no intentional falsification. I find for 
Applicant as to SOR paragraphs 2.a, 2.b., and 2.c and find for Applicant as to Personal Conduct, SOR subparagraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
