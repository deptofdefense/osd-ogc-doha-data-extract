<P>While he was making payments on a Chapter 13 bankruptcy wage-earner's plan, Applicant was falling behind in paying other debts. He scheduled credit 
counseling for two days after his hearing. Applicant was also involved in criminal conduct related to his consumption of alcohol, a bad check, and deliberately 
misleading a Defense Security Service investigator. Applicant failed to mitigate financial, criminal, alcohol, and personal conduct security concerns. Clearance 
is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. In accordance with Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6 &para; E3.1.2 (Jan 2. 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on 26 May 2005 detailing the basis for its 
decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 17 June 2005 and elected to have a hearing before an 
administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 1 November 2005. On 14 December 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 28 December 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old quality assurance auditor for a defense contractor. He has worked for this contractor and its predecessors for 31 &frac12; years. He has had a 
clearance since about 1977. He is a superior performer and model employee.</P> 
<P>Applicant and his wife became financially overextended in 1995. Applicant admits that he and his wife have never been good at budgeting. Ex. 2 at 4. In 1997, 
they filed a petition for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy wage-earner's plan. The plan was approved and Applicant completed payments over 60 months and had his 
debts discharged in 2002. While he was paying off his Chapter 13, Applicant incurred more than $21,000 in additional delinquent debts that were placed for 
collection or charged off, as alleged in the SOR. He has made no effort to resolve these delinquent debts nor to investigate some of the debts he does not 
recognize. His employer has referred him to a financial counselor with whom Applicant was scheduled to meet on 16 December.</P> 
<P>Applicant started drinking alcoholic beverages when he was 19 years old. Over the years, he would, "on average," consume a 12-pack of beer over a weekend. 
Ex. 2 at 2. In May, 2001, he became embroiled in a verbal spat with his wife as they were doing home repairs. He threatened to commit suicide, picked up a 
small knife and a screwdriver, and hit himself in the chest with them. Applicant's wife called police, who reported that, when they arrived at Applicant's house, 
"he appeared to be very intoxicated." Ex. 7. Applicant did not inflict injuries other than a few scratches and whelps on his stomach and shoulder. </P> 
<P>In August 2002, Applicant became involved in a physical altercation with his neighbor. When police arrived, they found Applicant "non responsive due the 
amount of alcohol consumed." Ex. 6.</P> 
<P>In April 2003, Applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident. The police officer who responded to the scene had Applicant perform a field sobriety test 
which he failed. Applicant refused the officer's request he take a Breathalyzer. He was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) and fleeing 
the scene of an accident. He eventually pled guilty in May 2005 to the DWI offense. He was placed on probation for two years. As a result of his conviction, 
Applicant was referred for an evaluation of his use of alcohol. The counselor tested Applicant and opined that he had a low probability of having a substance 
dependence disorder. Ex. P. She recommended Applicant be referred to the DWI education class, which he completed in November 2005. Ex. O. Applicant is 
still on probation until 2007. He continues to consume alcohol, but not with great frequency.</P> 
<P>In July 2003, while appearing in court for the DWI offense, Applicant was arrested for theft by check of between $20 and $500. He had been sent a notice of the 
bad check, but had failed to redeem it. He was taken to jail and required to post bond. The charge was dismissed after Applicant paid the check and the court 
fees before 22 March 2004. </P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In any matter within the executive branch of the Government of the United States, it is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, 
fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation. 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government 
of the United States.  <EM>See Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 30 October 2003, Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement to an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). In the statement, Applicant claimed that, 
other than his DWI arrest, he "had not had any other problems with the police or law enforcement to include alcohol or drug related offenses." Ex. 2 at 2.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denied deliberately omitting his arrest for theft from his signed, sworn statement. He claimed he was under the understanding that all the information 
he would give was voluntary and he had some right under the Privacy Act. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Answer at 3; Tr. 33. After carefully observing Applicant's demeanor and listening to 
his testimony, I find he deliberately falsified his statement to the DSS agent. An Applicant's involvement with law enforcement officials is relevant and 
material to his security worthiness. Therefore, I find Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1997 (&para; 1.a); had six debts totaling more than $17,200 that had been charged off 
as bad debts (&para;&para; 1.b-1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.m); had six delinquent debts totaling more than $4,000 that were in collection status (&para;&para; 1.e, 1.g, 1.i-1.l); and was convicted 
of theft (&para; 1.n). Applicant admitted all the allegations, except &para;&para; 1.d and 1.l, with explantion. An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1.) and is 
unable or unwilling to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Even while paying on his wage-earner's plan, Applicant was failing to pay his other debts. He knew 
the Government was concerned about his debts, but did nothing to resolve them. Deceptive or illegal financial practices such as check fraud are also potentially 
disqualifying. DC E2.A6.1.2.2. Although Applicant will receive counseling in the future, he failed to demonstrate that his financial problems will not continue. 
None of the mitigating conditions apply. I find against Applicant on &para; 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J-Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI and leaving the scene of an accident in April 2003 (&para; 2.a); was arrested in July 2003 
and convicted of theft (&para; 2.b); and violated 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 by deliberately providing false information in a signed, sworn statement given to a DSS agent (&para; 
2.c). Applicant admitted each of the allegations, with explanation. A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established each of the allegations. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is potentially disqualifying for an applicant to engage in criminal conduct (DC E2.A10.1.2.1) whether it 
is a single serious crime (violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001) or multiple lesser offenses (DC E2.A10.1.2.2). After examining all of the mitigating conditions, I 
conclude none apply. I find against Applicant on &para; 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G-Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged that, at times between 1975 and October 2003, Applicant used alcohol to the point of intoxication (&para; 3.a); threatened to commit 
suicide after consuming alcohol in May 2001 (&para; 3.b); was involved in a physical altercation with a neighbor after consuming alcohol (&para; 3.c); and was arrested 
for driving while intoxicated in April 2003 and leaving the scene of an accident (&para; 3.d). Applicant admitted each of the allegations, except that in &para; 3.a. 
Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established each of the alcohol-related incidents alleged in the SOR. It is a potentially disqualifying condition to be involved in alcohol-related 
incidents away from work. DC E2.A7.1.2.1. Applicant does not believe he has a drinking problem, and he has some support from a counselor that he is not 
alcohol dependent. He asserts that he only had a beer or two during the incidents. Yet the record shows impairment at significantly greater levels of alcohol 
consumption than Applicant is willing to admit. He failed the field sobriety tests that preceded his DWI arrest, and the police officers who saw Applicant after 
his "suicide attempt" and the fight with his neighbor report he was very intoxicated. I find his consumption of alcohol does cause him problems. Applicant 
claims he rarely drinks, now, and only has a beer or two when he does. Normally, that might invoke MC E2.A10.1.3.3 (positive changes in behavior supportive 
of sobriety). Unfortunately, based on his lack of candor during his testimony and in his previous statements, I was unable to conclude he was being honest with 
me. I find against Applicant on &para; 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline</STRONG> <STRONG>E-Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts in a signed, sworn statement by denying any arrests other than that of April 2003, when he had 
also been arrested in July 2003 (&para; 4.a). Applicant admitted the allegation, with explanation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard 
classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a security determination is 
a security concern and may be disqualifying. DC E2.A5.1.2.3. Information is material if it would affect a final agency decision or, if incorrect, would impede a 
thorough and complete investigation of an applicant's background. ISCR Case No. 01-06870, 2002 WL 32114535 at *6 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2002). An 
applicant's criminal history is a matter that could affect a final agency decision on whether to grant the applicant a clearance and his failure to disclose it would 
impede a thorough investigation of the applicant's background. I conclude Applicant deliberately tried to mislead the DSS agent by claiming he had never been 
arrested for other than the DWI. None of the mitigating conditions listed under the guideline apply. I find against Applicant on &para; 4.</SPAN></P>
