</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 17, 2003, under the 
applicable Executive Order<A HREF="01-25258.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="01-25258.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security 
concerns raised under Guideline E  (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  On January 23, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a 
hearing before an administrative judge.  On July 21, 2005, the case was assigned to me.  I convened a hearing on October 5, 2005, to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced eleven 
exhibits, identified as Government's Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 11.  Applicant called no witnesses and introduced fourteen exhibits, identified as Applicant's Ex. 
A through N.  Applicant submitted a summary memorandum and an additional exhibit, identified as Ex. O, after the close of the hearing. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant objected to the admission of the Government's Ex. 6 and Ex. 8.  After postponing a decision on the admissibility of these exhibits until a foundation 
could be laid, I overruled Applicant's objection and admitted Ex. 6 and Ex. 8 as relevant and material.  The Government's Exs. 1 through 5, 7, and 9 through 11 
were admitted without objection.  The Government objected to the admission of Applicant's Ex. H and Ex. J.  Applicant withdrew Ex. H.  I sustained the 
Government's objection to Ex. J, a letter to Applicant's counsel by Applicant's previous counsel, who offered commentary on the observations and actions of a 
judge in a proceeding at which he represented Applicant's business.  In lieu of Ex. J, Applicant agreed to submit a transcript of the proceeding referenced in the 
letter.  The Government did not object to the Applicant's proffer of the transcript, identified as Applicant's Ex. O, or to Applicant's post-hearing summary 
memorandum. Additionally, Applicant's Exs. A through G, I, and K through N were admitted to the record without objection.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding October 26, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains seven allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied any 
disqualifying conduct under Guideline E and offered additional information which he claimed explained, refuted, extenuated, or mitigated the allegations set 
forth in each of the seven subparagraphs of the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 69 years old and president and chief executive officer of a privately-held corporation which has been a defense contractor since 1979. (Ex. 1; Ex. 
L; Tr. 63-64)  After graduating from high school in 1954, Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force for four years. He then studied electronic engineering for three 
years at a university.  (Ex. 1.)  From 1959 through 1978, he worked for defense contractors in senior electronics and management positions. (Tr. 41-42.)  In 
1979 he and a partner established their own small company, specializing in the manufacture of specialized electronic devices used by the U.S. military.  As 
prime government contractors and as subcontractors, the company has designed, developed, and produced over $90,000,000 in equipment since 1979.  
Beginning in 1986, the company entered into a number of contracts to produce electronic devices for the military. (Ex. 4, at 2.)  The company is currently 
selling approximately $3 million in military equipment to the Government each year.  (Ex. L; Tr. 72-73.)   While the company employed as many as 70, 80, or 
90 individuals in the past, it currently employs about  25 people. (Ex. L; Tr. 68; 92.)  As a government contractor, Applicant has held a security clearance 
continuously since 1960.  (Answer to SOR, at 2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has known his business partner since 1973, and they are personal friends.  (Tr. 94)  On his security clearance application (SF-86), Applicant listed his 
partner as a person who knew him and could attest to where Applicant had lived from 1989 to 2001.  (Ex. 1, at 1.)  Together, Applicant and his partner own the 
building where they carry out their business, and their company leases the building from them.  (Tr. 69-70.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In developing their business, the two partners divided duties according to their respective strengths and experience.  Applicant used his technical and marketing 
background to seek out new customers and, from the company's inception to the present time, has served as the company's chairman and chief executive 
officer.  His partner carried out administrative and financial duties for the company.  (Tr. 65; 90.)  From approximately 1990 to 1995, the partner served as 
president of the company.  During that time, Applicant focused his energies on marketing and developing business, and he spent approximately one-half of his 
time in travel away from the office.  Some of his financial and administrative duties were delegated to the company's general manager and to his business 
partner.  (Tr. 89-90.)  Applicant had overall responsibility for program review but did not certify periodic payment requests.  (Tr. 78-80) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1991, the Government awarded the company a delivery order, identified as Y302,  under a firm-fixed price contract in the amount of approximately 
$4,590,000.00 for the fabrication, test, and delivery of 23 military electronic devices.  The period of performance of the contract was from March 12, 1991 to 
November 1992.  The unit price for labor, materials and profit for each electronic device was $199,564.  (Ex. 11, at 1-2.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After the contract was awarded, the project manager for the contract became aware that the actual costs for labor and materials required to complete the contract 
were less than the parties had bargained for in the contract, thereby resulting in a large un-bargained-for projected profit for the company.  (Ex. 11, at 1-4.)  In 
arch 1991, this information was brought to the attention of Applicant's partner, who was, at that time, the president of the company.  Internal company 
documents quoted in the Government's Memorandum in Support of Offer of Proof<A HREF="01-25258.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> indicated the company considered using the excess profits--estimated to be 
approximately $1.7 million--to build company assets.  ( Ex.  11, at 3.)  In June 1991, Applicant's partner and Applicant were each awarded a bonus of 
$150,000 (to be paid over three years) based on the award of delivery order Y302. (Ex. 11, at 4.)  In December 1992, Applicant's partner and Applicant were 
awarded bonuses of $325,000 and $330,000 respectively and $35,715 each in dividends on their company stock holdings.  (Ex. 11, at 4, fn 1.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 1992, Applicant's partner signed, for the company, a progress payment request (SF-1443), identified as Progress Payment 16.  In signing the SF-1443,  
he certified the information on the form was correct and it was based on the books and records of the company, even though he knew the actual manufacturing 
costs to the company were far below those originally negotiated, the amount requested exceeded actual costs, and the amount requested was not a good faith 
estimate of actual costs.  (Ex. 11, at 8-9.)  Neither the company nor Applicant's partner denied making a material false statement to the Department of Defense 
in July 1992 when the partner, representing the company,  signed and filed the SF-1443 requesting Progress Payment 16.  (Ex. 11, at 9.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1994, the Defense Contract Audit Agency conducted a review of the contracts awarded to Applicant's company (Tr. 84.)  Applicant reviewed the company's 
response to the audit.  (Tr. 85.)  In September 1995, the Inspector General, Department of Defense, (IGDoD), began an investigation to determine whether the 
company withheld any material information from or made any false statements to the Government in connection with the negotiation and subsequent award of 
firm fixed price Delivery Order Y302. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 2000, the partner pled guilty to one criminal charge of making a false statement to the Government (18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001), was assessed $50, fined $5,000, 
and awarded supervised probation of 12 months.  Pursuant to the provisions of 10 U.S.C. 2408 and 48 CFR 203.570-2, he was barred for five years from 
working for the company as a member of its Board of Directors, or as an officer, supervisor, or manager.<A HREF="01-25258.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  (Ex. 6; Ex. 8.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In July 2000, the company also pled guilty to one criminal charge of making a false statement to the Government (18 USC &sect; 1001).  While Applicant was not 
personally charged with the crime, he appeared and entered a guilty plea on behalf of the company.  (Ex. 7.)  The company was assessed $200, fined $20,000, 
and awarded supervised probation of two years. <A HREF="01-25258.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> (Ex. 7; Ex. 9.)  The criminal fine was paid in full by the company.  (Tr. 58.)  Special conditions of probation 
required the company to submit to regular or unannounced examinations of its books and records and interrogation of knowledgeable persons within the 
organization.  Additionally, the company was required to notify the court of any adverse changes in its business or financial condition or prospects, the 
commencement of any bankruptcy proceedings, the initiation of any major civil litigation, criminal prosecution, or administrative proceedings against it, or any 
investigation or formal inquiries by governmental entities of violations of criminal law.  The company was also required to give notice of its criminal conduct to 
its employees and shareholders and to inform them of its program to prevent and detect violations of law.  (Ex. 9, at 3.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a result of the IG DoD's  investigation, the United States alleged the company made false statements and failed to disclose material information in 
connection with Delivery Order Y302, thereby violating the Truth in Negotiations Act, 10 U.S.C. &sect; 2306a, 41 U.S. C. &sect; 254b, and the False Claims Act, 31 
U.S.C. &sect;3729, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">et</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">seq</SPAN>.  Additionally, the United States alleged that, as a result of its false statements, the company was subject to civil liability under the 
provisions of 31 U.S.C. &sect; 3729, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">et</SPAN>. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">seq.</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The United States also alleged that, between 1988 and 1995, the company made false representations as a part of its contract negotiations with the Government 
for design and production of specialized military electronics equipment and that the Government made payments on the negotiated contracts based on the 
company's false representations.  The United States further alleged the company did not provide accurate, current or complete cost data for labor hours charged, 
and it overcharged on labor hours even when it had prior contract production information showing that fewer labor hours were required.  The United States also 
alleged the company overcharged the Government over $900,000 on material costs on the several contracts.  (Ex. 4, at 2-4.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was not personally charged in the civil matter.  He acknowledged an awareness of a disagreement between the company's managers and the 
government auditors on issues of pricing, but asserted such disagreements were common in the administration of government contracts.  (Answer to SOR, at 
unnumbered page 4.)  As president of the company, Applicant assumed responsibility for admitting unlawful conduct and paying penalties assessed.  (Tr. 55-57.)  While the company did not admit liability for the actions alleged by the United States, it signed a Consent Decree on July 24, 2000, in which it agreed to 
pay the United States $2,500,000.00 in full settlement and satisfaction of the claims raised by the United States.  ( Ex. 4.)  Applicant personally guaranteed 
$100,000 toward satisfaction of the indebtedness.  (Answer to SOR, at unnumbered page 3.)  At his hearing, Applicant affirmed that all payments under the 
Consent Decree and civil settlement were timely made.  (Tr. 58.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the company's admitted conduct raised the prospect of contract debarment, the company and a military department within the Department of Defense 
entered into a three-year  administrative agreement to ensure the company carried out acceptable contracting practices and established and implemented a 
program of compliance reviews, audits, and reports.  The company developed a written code of ethics and appointed an ethics and compliance administrator 
who was responsible for identifying and investigating violations of the company's code of ethics.  (Ex. G; Tr. 58-61.)  During the three-year period in which the 
company was under the compliance agreement, the company was reviewed and audited several times, and no improper conduct was found.  The company was 
released from the administrative agreement in March 2003.  (Ex. D.)  It was never suspended or disbarred from government contracting and continues to receive 
government contracts.  (Tr.52;59; 61.)  As president, Applicant has directed that the ethics and compliance program remain a part of the company's contracting 
policy.  (Tr. 60.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant acknowledged the difficulties his partner's conduct had caused the company.  He also acknowledged his partner's technical and engineering strengths 
and their importance to the quality of the company's products.  (Tr. 98-99.)  He affirmed his continuing respect for his partner and his confidence in his ability 
to perform his duties.  (Tr. 94-95.) </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E  - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was president and chief operating officer of a government contracting company, which was investigated by the IG DoD, 
pursuant to findings by the Defense Contract Audit Agency that the company had failed to disclose accurate cost and pricing data while negotiating a contract 
with the Department of Defense (&para; 1.a.); that the IG DoD disclosed evidence that the company engaged in defective pricing and labor mischarging (&para; 1.b.); that 
in July 2000 the company pled guilty to one count of making a false statement and was sentenced to 24 months probation and fined $40,000 (&para; 1.c.); that the 
company entered into a civil settlement with the Government in July 2000 and agreed to pay $2,500,000 to the United States for violations of the Truth in 
Negotiations Act and the False Claims Act (&para; 1.d.); that Applicant, as Guarantor, was liable for $100,000 to be paid in satisfaction of a $2,500,000 settlement 
between the company and the United States (&para;1.e.); that prior to the investigation by the IG DoD, Applicant was aware of complaints about the inaccuracy of 
labor hours charged to a government contract by the company (&para; 1. f.) that  prior to the investigation by the IG DoD, Applicant was aware of complaints about 
the correctness of  pricing on a DoD delivery order by the company (&para; 1.g.)  Applicant admitted the facts alleged in &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., and 1g. were true 
or partially true but denied they were evidence of disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  He denied that part of the allegation in &para; 1.c. 
which stated the fine paid by the company for its admitted violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 was $40,000.  Record evidence established the fine was $20,000. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government argued that Applicant's failure as chief executive officer to exercise adequate oversight demonstrated disqualifying conduct under Guideline E 
even if he had no actual knowledge of his partner's personal criminal conduct and the wrongdoing and criminal conduct imputed to the company.  Applicant 
presented evidence that he was working to develop new business for the company and was therefore absent from the daily operations of the company during the 
time his partner, who was the president of the company from approximately 1990 to 1995, engaged in criminal conduct and  wrongdoing.  Applicant also 
presented evidence that he took strong steps to admit the company's wrongdoing and criminal conduct when he learned of it, to comply with all penalties levied 
upon the company for criminal conduct, and to impose policies to remedy the ethical and managerial weaknesses that gave rise to the wrongdoing and criminal 
conduct.  Applicant was never charged personally with criminal conduct or wrongdoing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government expressed concern that Applicant retained his business relationship and personal friendship with his partner in spite of the partner's 
wrongdoing and criminal conduct.  The record shows Applicant complied with statutory requirements limiting his partner's role in the company's management.  
While acknowledging his partner's wrongdoing, he also affirmed his confidence in his partner's rehabilitation and his capacity to do vital work for the 
company.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record is less clear about Applicant's knowledge of excess labor and materials costs which the company charged the Government.  Applicant 
acknowledged he was aware of differences of opinion between the company's program managers and the Government's contract monitors.  However, the 
record does not specify how these differences of opinion may have been related to conduct later identified as dishonest or deceptive dealing by the company.  
The record does show Applicant signed a consent decree acknowledging the company's commitment to pay $2,500,000 in full settlement and satisfaction of 
claims by the Government that the company had overcharged on material costs and labor.  Applicant guaranteed payment of $100,000 of the settlement, and he 
ensured full payment of the total amount within the deadlines set by the agreement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's partner's certification of a false payment request, which resulted in criminal charges against him personally and against the company, occurred in 
1992.  The conduct which resulted in civil penalties to the company occurred between 1988 and 1995.  The record evidence shows the company complied with 
all remedial instructions and timely paid all fines and penalties deriving from the criminal and civil charges.  The company has submitted to scrutiny and review 
by governmental entities that oversee contracting practices.  In his capacity as chief executive officer and president of the company, Applicant has established 
ethical standards and operating policies to ensure that such disqualifying conduct does not occur again.  The company has not been disbarred from contracting 
and has subsequently been awarded contracts by governmental entities.  After nearly being derailed, the company appears solidly back on track, thanks in no 
small part to Applicant's leadership and good judgment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have evaluated Applicant's credibility and I have considered the record as a whole.  I have weighed the evidence of Applicant's conduct against the whole 
person standard specified in Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.1. of the Directive.  I conclude the record does not sustain the Guideline E allegations in the SOR that 
Applicant personally engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations.  The record shows that Applicant's business partner and associate admitted to disqualifying conduct when he was president 
of the company that he and Applicant founded.  During the period of his partner's malfeasance, Applicant was focused on engineering questions and seeking 
new markets.  Financial issues were delegated to the business partner.  While it could be argued that in 1992 Applicant should have been more attentive to the 
details of contract management within his small company, it cannot be convincingly argued that his conduct demonstrates questionable judgment or an 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Accordingly, the Guideline E allegations in the SOR are concluded for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
