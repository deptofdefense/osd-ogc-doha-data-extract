<P>Applicant has a judgment against him for almost $20,000 that dates back to the mid1990s,</P> 
 
<P>and four other delinquent debts totaling about $615.00.  These debts have not been satisfied or otherwise resolved.   He also wrote five bad checks in 
1995/1996, totaling about $440.00.  Criminal charges were filed, but were dismissed after a civil compromise was reached and Applicant agreed to pay the

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
denied or revoked.  </P> 
 
<P>On March 4, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have a decision made after a hearing before a DOHA 
Administrative Judge.  The case was originally assigned to another Administrative Judge, but was transferred to me on April 15, 2003, because of caseload 
considerations.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 15, 2003, and the hearing was conducted on May 2, 2003.  At the hearing, Department Counsel 
offered 13 exhibits  (Government Exhibits (GX) 1 - 13).  Applicant testified on his own behalf and offered two exhibits</P> 
 
<P>(Applicant's Exhibits (AX) A - J).  Applicant submitted two additional exhibits after the hearing (AX C and AX D).  The transcript (Tr) was received at DOHA 
on May 19, 2003. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 43-year-old test technician for a defense contractor.  The SOR contains five allegations under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and one 
allegation under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits SOR allegations 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., </P> 
 
<P>and 2.a.  These admissions are accepted and made Findings of Fact.  Based on the contents of the case file, including Applicant's testimony and all exhibits, I 
make the additional following Findings of Fact as to each SOR allegation. </P> 
 
<P>GUIDELINE F (Financial Considerations)  </P> 
 
<P>1.a. - As of March 4, 2003, Applicant was indebted to Collection Agency A in the approximate amount of $19,956.00, for a judgment issued against him in 
November 1998.  Applicant has explained how he views this debt and states that it "was my impression after a foreclosure, loans were paid" (Tr at 27 -33), but 
he has not documented or otherwise established that the debt never actually existed or, if it did, that it no longer exists as a valid debt. </P> 
 
<P>On May 15, 2003, Applicant contacted an attorney who responded that "after evaluating case no. MC57670, the outstanding 2<SUP>nd</SUP> trust deed, and a number of 
your financial obligations, we believe that a bankruptcy may benefit you" (AX D).  The case number cited above is the same that appears in the March 27, 2002 
credit report referring to the October 1997 judgment for $19,955.00 (GX 4).</P> 
 
<P>I find that the debt and judgment cited in SOR 1.a. remain open and valid.    </P> 
 
<P>1.b. - Applicant is indebted to Medical Firm B in the approximate amount of $215.00, for an account placed for collection.  Although Applicant has repeatedly 
claimed that he is not aware of the debt and that it may be his daughter's medical debt, he has not taken steps to resolve this debt. His explanation about the 
family problems that allegedly prevented any attempt at resolution (Tr at 34) is not persuasive, particularly considering the time that has elapsed since he 
became aware of DoD's concerns about this debt.  </P> 
 
<P>1.c. - Applicant is indebted to Cable Company C in the approximate amount of $70.00, for an account placed for collection.  As of the hearing date, he had not 
yet resolved this debt and, apparently, had not made any significant efforts to do so.  </P> 
 
<P>1.d. - Applicant is indebted to Telephone Company D in the approximate amount of $209.00, for an account placed for collection.  As of the hearing date, he 
had not yet resolved this debt and, apparently, had not made any significant efforts to do so. </P> 
 
<P>1.e. - Applicant is indebted to Hospital E in the approximate amount of $117.00.  Applicant does not recall going to this facility, but has not contacted the credit 
reporting agencies to challenge the debt or ask questions about it (Tr at 36).  </P> 
 
<P>All of the above debts have remained unresolved for as long as eight years.  I have considered Applicant's work history, as shown in AX A.   </P> 
 
<P>  Guideline J (Criminal Conduct)</P> 
 
<P>2.a. -  Applicant wrote a bad check in February 1995, three bad checks in December 1995 and one more bad check in January 1996, to stores that filed criminal 
complaints with the local District Attorney.  On February 23, 1996, Applicant was charged in State A with two counts of writing bad checks, both 
misdemeanors.  Criminal charges were dismissed after a civil compromise under which Applicant paid the debts (Tr at 37, 38).  </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman Bold"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Considering the evidence as a whole, I find the following specific adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P> 
 
<P>GUIDELINE F (Financial Considerations)</P> 
 
<P><EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</P> 
 
<P>3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</P> 
 
<P>Condition that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>3. The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, business turndown, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation).</P> 
 
<P>GUIDELINE J (Criminal Conduct)</P> 
 
<P><EM>The Concern</EM>: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>1.  Any criminal conduct . . . ;</P> 
 
<P>2.. . . .multiple lesser offense</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>1. The criminal behavior is not recent</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"Eligibility for access to classified information is restricted to U.S. citizens whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United 
States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion and sound judgment, . . . and willingness to abide by regulations governing the use, 
handling, and protection of classified information."  (Executive Order 12968  &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995).  Eligibility is predicated upon an applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I have evaluated the totality of the evidence under both the specific additional guidance found in Enclosure 3 to the Directive and the general guidelines under 
Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2 to the Directive. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS </SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the early 1990s, Applicant was working for his present employer and also opened a sandwich shop with money received from an inheritance (Tr at 38, 39).  
The shop failed and then Applicant was laid off.   The bad checks were written during this period (Tr at 40).  Applicant is married and has five children (Tr at 
44).  Applicant has about $17,000.00 equity in his home and a 401k plan containing about $3,000.00 (Tr at 48).  During the month prior to the hearing, 
Applicant and his wife discussed filing for bankruptcy (Tr at 49) and did contact an attorney after the hearing  (Tr at AX D).  Applicant has paid off some of the 
debts cited in his credit reports, but not the ones cited in the SOR (Tr at 51). </P> 
 
<P><EM>Guideline F </EM>- The Judgment for $19,956.00 (SOR 1.a.) is by far the largest debt alleged in the SOR.  The issuance of the judgment in October 1997 is found in 
credit reports dated May 21, 1999 (GX 5), March 27, 2002 (GX 4), and January 23, 2003 (GX 6, GX 7, and GX 8).  This judgment is discussed by Applicant in 
his sworn statement of July 21, 1999 (GX 9), in which he states the judgment pertains to Applicant's business, which subsequently failed, after which the 
business site owner demanded payment of three years rent due pursuant to their rental agreement. </P> 
 
<P>The other debts cited in the SOR are also clearly established by the totality of the record,</P> 
 
<P>so the important question to be resolved is whether Applicant has mitigated the negative impact of his failure to resolve the debts over a period of many years.  I 
have considered his family and employment problems and given them considerable weight in my evaluation, but the record compels the conclusion that 
Applicant has not made significant efforts to resolve the cited debts since being recalled by his employer regaining employment in May 2002.  I note his recent 
inquiries into the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection, but only after the hearing did he contact an attorney and obtain an opinion the bankruptcy was a 
viable option.     </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I am required to base my evaluation and decision on whether Applicant's conduct comes with any of the Directive's Disqualifying Conditions (DC).  I conclude 
that he does have at least an eight-year history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC 1), and has shown an inability, if not unwillingness, to satisfy his 
debt (DC 3), despite having funds and assets currently available to  pay off the smaller debts, and at least make payments on the largest debt cited in SOR 1.a.  
In addition, he has had the legal remedy of filing for bankruptcy protection available to him, but has procrastinated in doing so until just recently. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to possible Mitigating Conditions (MC), Applicant's financial problems are still recent  and are not isolated, so that MC 1 and MC 2 dos not apply.  </SPAN>Since 
Applicant had been laid off for six years and four months out of the ten years prior to the hearing (Tr at 18), <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3 may apply as to how the debts were incurred 
but not as to their resolution, since the record indicates that resolving the cited debts have been within his ability during the past year.  Applicant has not 
demonstrated that he is receiving credit counseling, or that his financial problems are under control, as required to qualify for MC 4, nor has he yet initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors, as required by MC 6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The fact that his wife generally handled the checkbook does not excuse his own responsibility for his own debts or his failure to resolve debts so long 
delinquent.  The issuance of five bad checks in 1995/1996 indicates how long the financial irresponsibility has lasted.  Applicant has certainly had not yet 
established financial rehabilitation.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM>Guideline J </EM>- the five bad checks in question were for $190.00 in February 1995, $51.75, 90.34, and $103.66 in December 1995, and $23.42 in January 1996 
(GX 12).  In each case, the creditor had made phone calls, and sent letters, with no response (GX 13).  The matter was dismissed  after Applicant and the 
creditors reached a civil compromise and Applicant paid the debts (GX 11).  </P> 
 
<P>Disqualifying Conditions 1 (any criminal conduct) and 2 multiple lesser offenses) are applicable.  As to Mitigating Conditions, MC 1 is applicable since the bad 
checks were not issued recently (1995 and 1996).   MC 2 is not applicable since the issuance of five bad checks cannot be considered an isolated event.  Under 
C 4, the record does not indicate that the misconduct is "not likely to recur," and there is "no clear evidence of successful rehabilitation," as required by MC 
5. </P> 
 
<P>Under these circumstances, the issuance of the bad checks is still of security significance. </P> 
 
<P>Overall, I conclude that totality of the evidence supports all of the SOR allegations and their nexus or connection with Applicant's security clearance eligibility.  
The same cannot be said for Applicant's offer of evidence in mitigation.  His wife's involvement in handling family debts and payments does not excuse his 
failure to exercise his personal financial responsibility.   </P> 
 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  As required by 
DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended, at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified  information is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."  Applicant has not demonstrated he possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness 
required of anyone seeking access to the nation's secrets. His conduct creates significant doubts about serious matters, and such doubts must be resolved against 
the granting of a clearance.     </P>
