<P>Applicant has a lengthy history of alcohol-related incidents. He was evaluated as alcohol dependent after a 2002 conviction for driving while intoxicated. He 
resumed drinking as soon as he completed a court-ordered DWI education course. Although he claims he has reduced his consumption of alcohol, sufficient

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 29 March 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision<A HREF="04-01108.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive. Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 16 May 2005, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 8 July 2005. On 17 
August 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 25 August 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 31-year-old radar technician for a defense contractor. He has held a security clearance for 10 years. Applicant is a single parent of a young 
daughter, and helps his girlfriend care for her children.</P> 
<P>Applicant started to consume alcohol when he was 14 or 15 years old. By the time he was in high school, he was drinking every weekend. In 1990, he was 
arrested for being a minor in possession of alcohol. In 1993, while home from college, he was arrested for public intoxication. </P> 
<P>Applicant began working for a defense contractor in 1995. In March 1996, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) and reckless driving. He was 
drinking to "excess" once or twice a week at the time. Ex. 2 at 2. DWI charges were not filed, but Applicant was convicted of reckless driving and paid a fine. </P> 
<P>In May 1997, Applicant was arrested for public intoxication-auto. The charge was dismissed. But by this time, Applicant was drinking "to excess" a couple of 
times a week. He was arrested again in June 1998 and eventually convicted of public intoxication. </P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested in March 2000 and charged with public intoxication and breaking the public peace. In June 2000, the court dismissed the case after 
Applicant complied with the terms of an order to defer adjudication.</P> 
<P>Applicant was arrested in March 2002 and charged with public intoxication. </P> 
<P>In August 2002, Applicant lost control of his vehicle and it rolled into a ditch. A passing motorist took Applicant to a hospital. Applicant refused a police 
request to provide a breath/blood sample to determine if he was intoxicated. He was arrested for DWI. Applicant did not consume alcoholic beverages between 
his arrest and his court appearance in April 2003. Applicant pled nolo contendere and was found guilty of DWI. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail, but it was 
suspended and he was placed under supervision of the court for 10 months. He was also required to submit to urinalyses and attend a DWI education program.</P> 
<P>In August 2003, as part of the court supervision, Applicant was admitted to an outpatient substance abuse program. He was diagnosed by a licensed clinical 
drug counselor as being alcohol dependent. He successfully completed the program, which included attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, and was 
discharged in March 2004. He was instructed to attend an after care program, as needed, and "to continue to make changes in daily living routines to support 
ongoing abstinence." Ex. 5 at 7. He was also ordered to take Antabuse, but the court retracted this order after Applicant's doctor refused to administer the drug.</P> 
<P>Applicant's last AA meeting was immediately before or immediately after he completed the alcohol education program in March 2004. He began consuming 
alcoholic beverages again by July 2004, and probably as early as March or April 2004. He still drinks, but he limits his drinking to social occasions. His wife 
last saw him drink a few weeks before the hearing. He had five or six beers throughout the day.</P> 
<P>A supervisor opined that Applicant was a trustworthy employee who should get a clearance. Although he knew Applicant had been involved in at least one-alcohol-related incident, he was not aware that a court had ordered Applicant into an alcohol education course. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication from 1988 to July 2004 (&para; 1.a); was convicted of minor in possession of 
alcohol in 1990 (&para; 1.b); was arrested in 1993 for public intoxication (&para; 1.c); was arrested in March 1996 for DWI and reckless driving (&para; 1.d); was arrested in 
ay 1997 for public intoxication auto, convicted, and fined (&para; 1.e); was arrested in June 1998 and convicted of public intoxication (&para; 1.f); was arrested in 
arch 2000 for public intoxication and breach of public peace for which he was granted deferred adjudication (&para; 1.g); was arrested in March 2002 for public 
intoxication and convicted (&para; 1.h); was arrested for DWI in August 2002, convicted, and required to participate in intensive outpatient substance abuse 
treatment in a state program, attend AA meetings, and have Antabuse therapy (&para; 1.i); received treatment for alcohol dependence from 11 August 2003-1 March 
2004 (&para; 1.j); continues to consume alcohol (&para; 1.k). Applicant basically admits all of the allegations with some explanation.<A HREF="04-01108.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute evidence of potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant has been 
involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work such as DWI. DC E2.A7.1.2.1. Applicant was diagnosed by a licensed clinical drug counselor as being 
alcohol dependent. <EM>See</EM> DC E2.A7.1.2.4. I find against Applicant on &para; 1.a to the extent it alleges Applicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication from 
1988 through his August 2002 arrest for DWI. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are two mitigating conditions that could apply to this case: The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem 
(MC E2.A7.1.3.2); and Applicant has made positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (MC E2.A7.1.3.3). Applicant has made some changes in his 
behavior supportive of sobriety-he has decreased the amount of alcohol he consumes. His last DWI incident was more than three years ago. However, I am 
reluctant to grant him a clearance in light of his inability to recognize the depth of his problem. He failed to acknowledge he had been evaluated as being 
alcohol dependent. He began drinking again as soon as he was no longer under the court's supervision. Although some alcohol dependent persons have shown 
they can consume alcohol in moderation, there hasn't been sufficient time-a little over a year-to determine whether Applicant will be able to maintain his 
sobriety in the future. I find against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
