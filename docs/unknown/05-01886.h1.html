</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 6, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant Statements of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated June 24, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted SOR 
allegations 1.a.(1) through (8), and denied (9) with an explanation. He admitted SOR allegations 1.b. (1) through (3), denied allegation 1.c. and 1.d., and 
admitted allegations 2.a., 2.b., 2.c. and 3.a. Applicant did not respond to allegations 2.d. or 2.e.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was assigned to me on October 17, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on October 18, 2005, scheduling the hearing for November 9, 2005. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted seven exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7. The exhibits were admitted 
into the record without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted two exhibits that were marked as Applicant's Exhibits (AE) A-B. The 
exhibits were admitted without objection. The transcript was received on November 28, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR, are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 30-year-old computer systems administrator who has worked for a federal contractor since 2002. Applicant was married in 1995, and divorced in 
1999. He has two children who live with their mother and for whom he pays child support. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was cited  about October 22, 1998, for Driving while License Suspended/Revoked. His drivers license had been suspended indefinitely as of

was reinstated after he paid the fines, court costs and delinquent fees. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January 2005. No assets were reported and his debts were discharged on April 27, 2005. Applicant claimed the 
only debt that was discharged was a car debt for repossession and he reaffirmed his other debts.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant has had delinquent debts in the past that were 
charged off and his "credit repair service" told him not to pay them because they were almost seven years old and would drop off his credit report soon. 
Applicant took their advice and did not pay the charged off debts.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed his Security Clearance Application (SCA) on May 14, 2002. In answering Questions 21<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant listed only two felonies that he had 
been charged with<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and failed to list the other felonies as detailed above. In answering Question 26<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant answered "No" and failed to list his offenses of 
January 8, 1997, April 28, 1998, and October 22, 1998, as detailed above. Applicant claimed he did not believe he had to list felonies that were committed as a 
juvenile or over seven years old because he had made an inquiry to his facilities security officer about this issue. On those felonies that were within the seven 
year period, Applicant claimed he did not associate being arrested with being actually charged and he could not remember the exact dates of the charges, so he 
did not list them.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> I find Applicant's testimony was not credible. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "No" to Question 34<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> which asked him if his wages had ever been garnished in the last 7 years. Applicant's wages were garnished in about 
ay 2001, for delinquent child support payments. Applicant claimed he was unaware that his wages were garnished and thought his payments were 
"voluntary." Applicant acknowledged he signed a court ordered garnishment document but claimed he was not aware his wages were being garnished because 
he believed he was having the payment deducted from his paycheck as a convenience to himself.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> I find Applicant's statements were not credible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant answered "No" to Question 35<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>. Applicant failed to list a repossession on a vehicle in March 1999, leaving a balance due of approximately $14, 
158.00. Applicant claimed although he was recently made aware that his ex-wife's car was repossessed, when he filled out his SCA he did not believe he was 
financially liable for the car. The car  had been awarded to her when they divorced. He later found out that he was being held responsible, so he subsequently 
filed for bankruptcy and included only this debt to be discharged.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> He reaffirmed his other debts choosing to pay them off. Although not alleged, Applicant 
failed to list on his SCA, delinquent debts that had been charged off prior to his filing for bankruptcy. Applicant claimed he did not believe he had to list 
charged off debtors. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claims he is a changed man that made stupid mistakes when he was young. He has since abandoned those negative influences in his life and regrets 
his past transgressions. He claims he has learned from his mistakes. He owns a home and is likely to obtain custody of his son this summer. Applicant's co-workers/supervisor/employer believe him to be loyal, trustworthy, strongly committed and dedicated to his job, his company, and his country.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline E, personal conduct, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations, with their respective DC and MC, apply in this case. 
Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, 
the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding 
circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the 
conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the 
probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or 
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="05-01886.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F- Financial Considerations-a security concern exists when a person has significant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible 
may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of 
life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guideline E, Guideline J, and Guideline F. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> <EM>), </EM>PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.4 (<EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging 
in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail),</EM> and PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency), 
</EM>all apply in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant deliberately failed to divulge on his SCA all of his transgressions with regard to his past felony criminal conduct, other criminal offenses and his 
wages being garnished. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2 applies. Applicant has a long sorted criminal history. When questioned as to his reasons for not providing the 
requested information, Applicant claimed it was because he had been told by his facilities security manager that he did not have to list criminal conduct 
committed as a juvenile. When questioned why he did not provide information about criminal conduct committed as an adult he stated it was because he 
thought he only needed to list his charges and not arrests. When his attention was directed to the specific language of the question he claimed he misunderstood 
it. PC DC E2. A5.1.2.4 applies. Applicant's testimony was consistently not credible. Applicant's past conduct including fourteen arrests, eleven of which were 
for felonies, his willingness to hide his past, and lack of truthfulness demonstrates questionable judgment and a pattern of dishonesty that makes him vulnerable 
as a security risk. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>The falsification was 
an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily), </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>The individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts), </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.4 <EM>(Omission of material facts was caused or 
significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully 
provided), </EM>and<EM> </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress). </EM>I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant concealed the full extent of past criminal misconduct. He did so by deliberately lying on 
his SCA, a felony violation. Applicant's actions were recent as evidence by his recent deliberate omissions. There is no evidence to suggest Applicant made a 
prompt good faith effort to set the record straight, but rather he continued to minimize his actions. Even taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the 
Applicant that he received bad advice from his facilities security manager, he still deliberately failed to divulge information about his felony arrests as an adult. 
PC MC E2.A5.1.3.2, PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3, and PC MC E2A5.1.3.4, do not apply. I considered Applicant's testimony regarding his failure to list his 
repossession and find his explanation to have merit under the circumstances. Although it appears Applicant has cleaned up his life and is now trying to be a 
productive citizen, I find his lack of candor and questionable judgment in filing out his SCA to be a security concern, therefore, PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 does not 
apply. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply under Guideline E. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns with regard to his personal 
conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged), </EM>and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser charges) </EM>apply. Applicant was arrested for 
numerous felonies and misdemeanors as both a juvenile and adult. He was convicted and sentenced as detailed above. Applicant did not provide truthful 
answers on his SCA, a violation of Title 18 U.S.C.&sect; 1001, a felony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>The conduct was not 
recent),</EM> CC MC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident), </EM>CC MC E2.A10.1.2.4 (<EM>The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur)</EM>, and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation)</EM>. Applicant's criminal offenses 
run the gamut and many are of a very serious nature involving questions of moral turpitude. Applicant's testimony often tried to minimize his actual 
involvement in some of the offenses charged. Applicant had a consistent and escalating pattern of criminal conduct that showed a total lack of respect for the 
rule of law. Applicant continued by lying on his SCA, a felony offense. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all of the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC), especially CC MC E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>The criminal behavior was not recent), </EM>CC 
C E2.A10.1.3.3. (<EM>The person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life), </EM>and CC MC 
E2. A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.). </EM>I find none apply. Although much of the conduct that occurred is not recent, the fact that 
Applicant willingly lied about it on his SCA in violation of a federal criminal statute is of grave concern and a recent occurrence that negates application of this 
mitigating condition. Also a concern is that much of his past criminal conduct involved theft and schemes of moral turpitude which reflects poorly on 
Applicant's character. It appears Applicant has stayed out of trouble for the past few years and is trying to turn his life around, which is applauded. 
Unfortunately he can not escape his long history of total disregard for the law as both a juvenile and an adult. Applicant's past history, questionable testimony, 
and failure to fully divulge his past conduct in a sworn document suggests a recurring pattern of deception that is a grave concern. I find Applicant has failed to 
mitigate the security concerns regarding his criminal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations),</EM> and FC DC 
E2.A6.1.2.3<EM> (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>),<EM> </EM>apply in this case. Applicant wrongly believed he was not responsible for a debt on his ex-wife's 
repossessed car. Applicant failed to pay this debt and it remained delinquent until he filed for bankruptcy and had the debt discharged. Applicant reaffirmed his 
other debts and has been paying them off. Applicant's other past delinquent debts were not part of the SOR and are not considered for disqualifying purposes. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and especially considered FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1 (<EM>The behavior was not recent), </EM>FC 
C E2.A6.1.3.3 (<EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),</EM> FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4 (<EM>The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)</EM>, and FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).</EM> Bankruptcy is a legitimate and legal means to resolve delinquent debts. Applicant exercised this option to 
resolve a major debt that technically belongs to him. When Applicant learned that a repossessed car debt did belong to him he took action to resolve it. He 
originally believed the car debt belonged to his ex-wife because she was in possession of the car. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. applies. He also reaffirmed his other 
debts and has continued to make payments on them. FC MC D2.A6.1.3.6 applies. Applicant has mitigated the security concern regarding financial 
considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the evidence in the record. I have also considered Applicant's juvenile status when he committed many of the criminal offenses, and his 
continuing criminal activity after attaining majority. I have considered the exhibits provided by Applicant. Although Applicant has started on the path of turning 
his life around, his long criminal history of committing serious offenses can not be overlooked as security concerns, along with his failure to divulge the full 
extent of his background. Applicant's history of unwillingness to comply with rules, in violation of the law, dishonesty, lack of candor, and questionable 
judgment heighten the security concerns. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his criminal conduct and personal conduct. He has 
successfully mitigated the security concern regarding financial considerations. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant, and Guidelines J and E 
are decided against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
