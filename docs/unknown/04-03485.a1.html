<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May 2, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons 
advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and 
Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On 
January 17, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed 
pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred in his synopsis; whether the Administrative Judge erred in his analysis 
of Applicant's plan to remedy his delinquent debts; and whether the Administrative Judge erred in his consideration of the mitigating conditions under the 
Adjudicative Guideline.  Applicant's first claim of error is not persuasive.  The Board reads a Judge's decision as whole.  The fact that the Judge's synopsis did 
not cite facts that were mentioned elsewhere in the Judge's decision does not render the decision defective.  Regarding Applicant's second issue, a reading of 
the Judge's decision as a whole shows that the Judge clearly considered Applicant's recent attempts at improving his financial situation.  However, the Judge 
was not obliged to give those attempts as much weight as Applicant would like.  Applicant has not established that the Judge erred because he gave less weight 
to favorable evidence than Applicant advocates.    As to Applicant's third issue, the Judge offered a rational explanation for his decision not to rely on 
Applicant's ex-wife's admissions to conclude that Applicant's delinquencies were absolved (namely the lack of specificity of the admissions).  Thus, Applicant 
has not demonstrated that the Administrative Judge erred in denying Applicant a clearance. </P>

<P>The decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a clearance is AFFIRMED.</P>
