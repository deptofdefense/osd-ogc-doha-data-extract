  The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security  clearance decision.  The Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable  evidence or vice versa.  Given the record evidence in this case, the Judge's findings of fact about Applicant's history of improper or illegal  drug use reflect a reasonable interpretation of the evidence as a whole.  In light of the Judge's findings, the Judge had a rational basis to  conclude Applicant's overall history of improper or illegal drug use raised serious security concerns under Guideline H, and that the evidence  which Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome those security concerns.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued the Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated November 25, 2003, which 
stated the reasons why DOHA proposed to deny or revoke Applicant's access to classified information.  The SOR was based upon Guidelines 
H (Drug Involvement).  Administrative Judge Thomas M. Crean issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated October 15, 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issue: whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised by 
Applicant's drug involvement had not been mitigated.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine 
whether there is factual or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with 
specificity and identify how the Administrative Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with 
specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or 
capricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or 
conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant 
evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it 
offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere 
difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decision).  In deciding whether the 
Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, 
the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance adjudications are 
conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of 
fact are supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary 
evidence in the same record.  In making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the 
Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is 
record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence 
supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.  Although a 
Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a heavy burden on 
appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at 
pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Items E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised by Applicant's drug involvement had not been 
mitigated</SPAN>.  On appeal, Applicant contends the Judge should have concluded that the security concerns raised by his prior drug use had been 
mitigated because: (1) the drug use was not recent,<A HREF="03-11655.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (2) it was isolated or aberrational,<A HREF="03-11655.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> (3) Applicant has demonstrated an intent not to 
abuse drugs in the future,<A HREF="03-11655.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and (4) Applicant's marijuana use was actually less than stated by the Judge in his conclusions.  In support of 
those contentions, Applicant asserts that: (i) his last use of drugs was in April 2003--over 18 months prior to the Judge's decision, (ii) in his 
September 2004 response to the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant stated that he did not intent to use marijuana 
again, (iii) Applicant used Percoset on only one occasion and Ritalin on only two occasions in the last 10 years, and (iv) Applicant only used 
marijuana on a quarterly to yearly basis, rather than on a quarterly basis from 1992 to 2003.  For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the 
Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P>The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the 
record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 (January 15, 2003) at p. 7.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence 
does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a 
whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  An applicant's disagreement with the 
Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, 
capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Given the record evidence in this case, the Administrative Judge's findings about Applicant's  lengthy and serious history of improper or 
illegal drug use reflect a reasonable interpretation of record evidence as a whole.  Applicant's challenge to the Judge's findings of fact reflect 
strong disagreement with the Judge's findings, but fail to demonstrate the Judge's findings are erroneous.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional 
Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  In light of the Judge's findings, the Judge had a rational basis to conclude that Applicant's overall 
history of improper or illegal drug use raised serious security concerns under Guideline H, and that the evidence which the Applicant had 
presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome those security concerns.  The Board does not find persuasive Applicant's contention that 
the Judge should have concluded his drug abuse history was mitigated under the Drug Involvement mitigating conditions.  Therefore, we 
conclude that the Judge's decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>
