<P><STRONG></STRONG><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>On February 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a 
security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, and other persons to whom 
he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not United States citizens or may be subject to duress and that he has traveled to his native India in 
1997.  On March 8, 2004, Applicant responded in writing and with attachments to the SOR allegations.  Applicant denies SOR 1.c., and he admits 1.a., 1.b., 
and 1.d. He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 4, 2004, which was forwarded to Applicant.  In the submission the Government 
included two documents for Administrative Notice: Items 5 and 6.  Applicant received the FORM on June 14, 2004, and failed to respond by the July 14, 2004 
deadline.  The case was assigned to me on July 26, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 53 years old and has been a senior associate with a defense contractor from 1982 to present.  He applied for a security clearance in June 2002.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Item 4)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in India in 1951 and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1986. He has an MBA awarded in 1975 by a university in India.  He 
worked in India from 1975 to 1977.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife who is a U.S. citizen have one child who was born in the United States.  He has lived at the same 
residence in State #1 for almost fifteen years.  (Item 4)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father and mother are citizens of and reside in India. Applicant's father retired more than 25 years ago from the Indian Army where he was a 
Brigadier General.  His brother worked for the Indian Army as a Brigadier General but has retired and no longer has an Indian government security clearance.  
He currently lives in the U.S. on an immigration visa and has a permanent resident card.  In 1997 Applicant traveled to India to visit his parents and brothers for 
21 days.  Applicant has a sister who was born in India and is a citizen of India, but lives in Canada. (Item 2) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">According to the U.S. Department of State Background Note on India, it is a federal republic.  The U.S. has transformed its relationship with India as U.S. 
interests require a strong relationship as both are democracies committed to political freedom protected by representative government.  They also share an 
interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.  The U.S. and India announced in January 2004 the Next Steps in the Strategic 
Partnership.  (Item 5)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government of India generally respects the human rights of its citizens according to the U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights 
Practices in 2003.  (Item 6)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the 
overall common sense determination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  The adjudication process 
is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as 
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).  Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of 
this case: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Foreign Influence (Guideline B) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. <STRONG>The Concern</STRONG>: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. 
Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of 
persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 484 
U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established an initial security concern under Guideline B<A HREF="02-30717.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (Foreign Influence) as Applicant's immediate family members are citizens of and 
reside in India. The Indian citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in 
the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  The possession of such ties 
raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.  The evidence of existence of immediate family members, 
who are citizens of and reside in, India comes within Disqualifying Condition 1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">However, based on the nature of the overall record, including the Applicant's extended ties in the United States where he has lived for over twenty years and the 
close relationship of India to the United States, I have determined that his family members in India do not constitute an unacceptable security risk under 
itigating Conditions 1 and 3.<A HREF="02-30717.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">   First, his father and brother no longer have any ties to the Indian Army as both are retired, his father for 25 years.  Further, his 
brother is now a permanent resident of the U.S.  Thus, his Indian family members no longer have any connection with the Indian government, nor is there any 
evidence that their presence in U.S. and India can be exploited by the Indian government.  Applicant does not have binding family ties in India as he has not 
visited his family in India since 1997, so his contact is casual and infrequent.  While Applicant was born in India, he has worked for a defense contractor since 
1982 and became a citizen of the United States in 1986.  Thus he has strong ties to the U.S. and strong family ties in the U.S. with his wife and child here.   
Further India and the U.S. have a strategic partnership.  As a democracy with an overall good human rights record, it is unlikely that India would pressure 
Applicant's elderly mother and father in such a way as to subject Applicant to exploitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt">After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under SOR Paragraph 1; I conclude that he has 
mitigated the allegations in SOR subparagraphs1.a. through 1.d.</SPAN></P>
