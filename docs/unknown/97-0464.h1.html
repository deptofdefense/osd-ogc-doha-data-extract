</P>

<P>	On July 9, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive
Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992
(Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant, and recommended
referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated July 28, 1997, the Applicant responded to
the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested a hearing.  A copy of the SOR is attached to this
Decision and incorporated herein by reference.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on August 21, 1997, and 
held a hearing on October 2, 1997.  The Department Counsel presented two exhibits ("Exhs") and
the testimony of no witnesses.  The Applicant's case consisted of his own testimony and the
presentation of no exhibits.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the transcript ("Tr") of
the hearing on October 8, 1997<A NAME="transcript receipt date"></A>.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following single
criterion: paragraph 1, Criterion H (drug involvement).  The Applicant has admitted the factual
allegations contained in each of the subparagraphs of the SOR.  Except as noted herein, the
Applicant's admissions are hereby incorporated as findings of fact.</P>

<P>	The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in
the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following additional Findings of Fact:</P>

<P>	The Applicant is a 20-year-old junior draftsman employed by a U.S. Government contractor. 
The Applicant seeks to obtain a Confidential<A NAME="level seeking or to retain?"></A> personnel security clearance.</P>

<P>	In August 1991 few weeks before the Applicant entered high school at age 14, he began to 
use marijuana with his friends and classmates.  He smoked marijuana one or twice a week for the
next two years.  He smoked marijuana daily during 1993-95 until he graduated in May 1995.  He
typically contributed anywhere from $5 to $10 a week with his friends to buy marijuana.  The
Applicant estimates that three-fourths of the student body of his high school was involved with
marijuana and/or other illegal drugs.  He was told on one occasion that a marijuana cigarette he
smoked also had hashish in it, but he was not sure, and it had no special effect on him.  He also
experimented with LSD given to him on three occasions during the December 1994-February 1995
period. </P>

<P>	 For the year after high school graduation the Applicant reduced his use of marijuana to about
three times a week.  He did take a puff or two on marijuana cigarettes offered to him on four
different occasions in the July-November 1996 period.  In a signed, sworn statement that the
Applicant gave to a Defense Investigative Service (DIS) agent on April 18, 1997, he declared that
he had "no intentions of using the drug in the future" and added that "[m]y future is more important
to me than the use of any type of illegal substance."  Exh. 2, page 2.<A HREF="97-0464.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Nevertheless, the Applicant
took a puff on an offered marijuana cigarette in August 1997, about a month or six weeks before the
hearing, and after he had responded to the SOR.  Tr pages 33-40.  He regretted that action and
declares that he has learned that marijuana use is not "conducive to a good future" and would not
like any future children of his to be born with defects attributable to drug usage.  Tr pages 41-43.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative
guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines
are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant
or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In
evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully con-sidered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P>

<P>	The criteria, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an
evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>CRITERION H - DRUG INVOLVEMENT</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>		Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions
regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an
unauthorized disclosure of classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P>			Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering:</P>

<P>			  (a)	drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act
of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens)
and</P>

<P>			  (b)	inhalants and other similar substances.</P>

<P>			Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal
drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical
direction.</P>

<P><STRONG>		Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be
disqualifying include: </STRONG></P>

<P>			  (1)	any drug abuse (see above definition); </P>

<P>			  (2)	illegal drug possession, including cultivation, process-ing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; </P>

<P><STRONG>		Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P>

<P>			  (3)	a demonstrated intent not to abuse any
drugs in the future;</P>

<P>	The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors
enumerated in Section F.3:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P>		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequences involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur
in the future.</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following
factors:</P>

<P>		The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P>

<P>		The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include
knowledgeable participation</P>

<P>		The frequency and recency of the conduct</P>

<P>		The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P>

<P>		The voluntariness of participation</P>

<P>		The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes</P>

<P>		The motivation for the conduct</P>

<P>		The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P>

<P>		The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision
to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding
that to do so is <U>clearly consistent</U> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may only draw those inferences
and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations
under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established
under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P>

<P>		It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence
standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the
interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard
indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they
must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government
to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of
the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the
Board in second-guessing the agency's national security
determinations.</P>

<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that
Supreme Court guidance in its context to go to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence
that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial
evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence -- rather than as an indication of
the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="97-0464.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose
of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation
of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an
applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold
a security clearance.<A HREF="97-0464.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor of the Applicant  who testified, the
undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Criterion H.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant's illegal drug purchases and use during and after high school were both
regular in frequency and prolonged.  This conduct falls within the scope of DC #1 and DC #2, which
are identified on page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>.  In the last two years he has moved out of his mother's home,
attended a community college, and has had several jobs, leading to his present professional position. 
It has, moreover, been more than two years since he used marijuana daily.  These have been
significant changes in his life.  However, he has continued to socialize with his former high school
friends in the past year or so and has taken a puff on a marijuana cigarette they offered him on five
different occasions.  The last time occurred (1) after his instructor hired him and told him that current
illegal drug abstinence was important<A HREF="97-0464.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> and, indeed, (2) after he responded to the SOR on July 28,
1997.  This conduct fails to <STRONG><U>demonstrate</U></STRONG> an intent not to abuse drugs in the future within the scope
of MC #3, which is identified on page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>. </FONT></P>

<P>	The Directive requires that the factors listed in Section F.3 and enclosure 2 to the Directive,
identified on page 4 <EM><STRONG>supra</STRONG></EM>, be considered, as appropriate, in making this decision.  The nature,
seriousness, frequency, and recency of his drug involvement all militate against the Applicant.  His
youthful age and relative inexperience weigh in his favor.  The absence of rehabilitation and the
reasonable likelihood that the Applicant will continue to use marijuana when presented to him in
certain social contexts are unfavorable in his case.  Complete abstinence from all illegal drug
involvement for a period of time beyond twelve months would strengthen his security clearance
application.  Therefore, Criterion H is concluded adversely to the Applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Formal findings as required by Enclosure 1 of the Directive (see paragraph (7) of section 3
of Executive Order 10865, as amended) and the additional procedural guidance contained in item
25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1. Criterion H:					AGAINST APPLICANT</P>

<P>	Subparagraph 1.a.:					Against Applicant</P>

<P>	Subparagraph 1.b.:					Against Applicant</P>

<P>	Subparagraph 1.d.:					Against Applicant</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>DECISION</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is the determination
of the undersigned that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
