<P>The Applicant was found guilty of two felonies for drug offenses committed in 1997.  He was sentenced to four to five years in prison, which was suspended.  
The provisions of 10 U.S.C. 986 apply.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 17, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on May 23, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on November 19, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on December 20, 2002, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for 
resolution on January 24, 2002.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's past criminal conduct militates against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 46 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  In April of 1976, the Applicant was found guilty of two felonies, Transportation of Marijuana, and Possession of Marijuana for Sale (Government Exhibits 
(GXs) 4, 6 and 7).  The underlying conduct for which he was found guilty occurred in November of 1975, when the Applicant was 19 years of age (GX 7 at 
page 1).  He knowingly drove a car across the U.S./Mexican border with marijuana in its trunk (<EM>id</EM>).  He explains, "I knew there would be Marijuana in the car 
trunk, and that it would be illegal, but I thought I would not get caught, and I did need the money" (<EM>ibid</EM>).  As a result of his conviction, the Applicant was 
sentenced, in part, to four to five years in prison, all suspended (GX 4).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The facts admitted by the Applicant in subparagraph 1.a., above, brings this case within the purview of 10 U.S.C. 986, which disqualifies him from having 
a security clearance granted or renewed by the Department of Defense.  In a meritorious case, however, the Secretary of Defense may authorized an exception to 
this prohibition (GX 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his sworn statement, he Applicant avers he "was young," but offers little else in the way of mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Conviction in a Federal or State court . . . of a crime and sentence to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">none.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence that are speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline J (criminal conduct); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, 
with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in 
all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude 
towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant was convicted for two felonious that occurred about 27 years ago.  He was sentenced to four to five years in prison, which was suspended, but 
this sentence brings him within the purview of 10 U.S.C. 986, which does not cite the age of the conviction as a factor to be weighed.  Pursuant to the 
provisions of the federal statute, Guideline J is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his criminal conduct.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: AGAINST THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a.   Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and <STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">supra</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
the Applicant.  I do not recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. 986.</SPAN></P>
