</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On July 31, 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-32670.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-32670.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under  Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on September 29, 
2003,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and  by letter dated October 8, 2003, he requested that his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of 
Relevant Material (FORM) on January 13, 2004.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 8.  By letter dated January 14, 2004, a copy of 
the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant did not 
submit additional information or objections within that time period.  On March 5, 2004, the case was assigned to me for a decision.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains ten allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Nine allegations relate to conduct addressed under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, and one 
allegation relates to conduct addressed under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all nine allegations under Guideline 
E and denied the Guideline J allegation.   His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 49-year-old welder employed by a defense contractor.  He was married in 1975, but he and his wife are now separated.  He is the father of one 
child, born in 1979. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant completed and certified a security clearance application (SF-86) on April 16, 2002.  He answered "no" to Questions 33, 35, 37,  38, and 39 on the 
SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 33 on the SF-86 reads: "<STRONG>Your Financial Record - Bankruptcy  </STRONG> In the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code 
(to include Chapter 13)?" In July 1997, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in a United States Bankruptcy Court. A payment agreement could not be 
reached.  In February 1998, the bankruptcy court entered an order dismissing Applicant's Chapter 13 petition after failure to confirm a payment plan.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 35 on the SF-86 reads: "<STRONG>Your Financial Record - Repossessions  </STRONG>In the last 7 years, have you had any property repossessed for any reason?"  In 
January 2001, Applicant turned possession of his home over to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) when he was unable to maintain 
monthly payments.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 37 on the SF-86 reads: "<STRONG>Your Financial Record - Unpaid Judgments  </STRONG> In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not 
been paid?"  In February 1997 a judgment was entered against Applicant in the amount of $136.00.  As of August 28, 2002, the judgment had not been 
satisfied.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 38 on the SF-86 reads: "<STRONG>Your Financial Delinquencies - 180 Days</STRONG>   In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?"  In 
February 1997, a judgment was entered against Applicant for $136.00.  As of August 28, 2002, Applicant had not satisfied the judgment.  Applicant owed an 
automobile credit company approximately $749.42 on a delinquent account which had been charged off as a bad debt in or about March 1998.  Applicant made 
the final payment to satisfy the debt in October 2001.  In January 1999, Applicant satisfied a judgment entered against him in the approximate amount of 
$1,586.00 for a loan he had failed to pay. Applicant is responsible for a debt of $740.40 on an account charged off as a bad debt in November 2000 and  referred 
for collection.  As of August 28, 2002, this debt had not been satisfied.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 39 on the SF-86 reads: "<STRONG>Your Financial delinquencies - 90 Days </STRONG> Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?" In February 1997, a 
judgment for $136.00 was entered against Applicant.  As of August 28, 2002, the judgment had not been satisfied.  As of August 2002, Applicant had not 
satisfied the aforementioned debt in the amount of $740.40.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After completing his SF-86, Applicant signed and dated the following statement:    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"<STRONG>CERTIFICATION BY PERSON COMPLETING FORM</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">My statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See section 1001 of Title 18, United 
States Code).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant denied deliberately falsifying his answers to Questions 33, 35, 37, 38, and 39 on his SF-86.  He said his brother helped him complete the SF-86 and 
entered data that was not accurate or complete.  Applicant did not thoroughly and carefully review the entries his brother made on the SF-86, and he signed and 
certified the answers provided by his brother.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E  - Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant deliberately falsified his answers on his SF 86 to questions 33, 35, 37, 38 and 39 (&para;&para; 1.a. (1), 1.b., 1.c.(1), 1.d.(1), 1.d.(2), 
1.d.(3), 1.d.(4), 1.e.(1) and 1.e.(2)).  Applicant admits the falsifications and argues they were carried out by his brother, to whom he entrusted the responsibility 
of preparing his SF-86.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant's responsibility to provide truthful and complete responses to questions on his or her SF-86 cannot be delegated to another person.  With respect to 
the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a.(1) through 1.e.(2), Applicant falsified his SF-86 by omitting and concealing relevant and material 
information about his debts and financial obligations in his responses to Questions 33, 35, 37, 38, and 39, bringing his conduct under disqualifying condition 
E2.A5.1.2.2.  He did not fully and truthfully provide the requested information, and thus mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.6. does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person's refusal to provide relevant and material information to the Government provides a rational basis for denial or revocation of access to classified 
information for that person.  ISCR Case No. 98-0445 at 3 (App. Bd. April 2, 1999), (quoting <EM>Gayer v. Schlesinger, </EM>490 F. 2d<EM> </EM>740, 754 (D.C. Cir. 1973); 
<EM>Clifford v. Shoultz</EM>, 413 F. 2d 868 (9<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 396 U.S. 962 (1969)).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in the SOR, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's assertions that he did not intend to falsify his 
responses to Questions 33, 35, 37, 38 and 39 on his SF-86 are not credible in light of his awareness of his financial problems over a period of several years and 
his creditors' many attempts to put him on notice of delinquent debts and financial liabilities.  Additionally, Applicant's statement that he failed to answer the 
questions accurately and completely because he had delegated the completion of his SF-86 to his brother lacks credibility.  Applicant's failure to provide his 
own complete, truthful, and correct answers to the questions about his financial situation reflects questionable judgment and raises a security concern under &para; 
E2.A5.1.2.2 of Guideline E.  His conduct also raises concerns under &para; E2.A5.1.2.5. because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty and rule violation.  His reticence 
to reveal the truth about his conduct suggests that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests above those of the government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1. does not apply to the facts of this case.  The information withheld by Applicant is pertinent to a determination of his 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. Two other mitigating conditions under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern 
raised by Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently 
provided the correct information voluntarily.  &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  While Applicant supplied some correct information about his financial delinquencies when 
questioned by a special agent of the Defense Security Service on August 28, 2002 (Item 7) and in response to interrogatories from DOHA on February 18, 2003 
(Item 8), his falsifications were not isolated incidents and they are recent.  Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.3. is also inapplicable, since Applicant did not make 
prompt good faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts.  Accordingly, the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. (2) 
of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant knowingly and willfully falsified his answers to Questions 33, 35, 37, 38, and 39 on his security clearance application in 
violation 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 and that these acts constituted felonious criminal conduct.  An applicant with a history or pattern of criminal behavior raises serious 
doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent  statement or representation in any matter within the 
executive branch of the Government of the United States.  18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001.  Security clearances are within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the 
Government of the United States.  <EM>See</EM> <EM>Egan,</EM> 484 U.S. at 527.  Applicant deliberately lied on the security clearance application he certified and signed for the 
purpose of obtaining a security clearance.  Under all the circumstances, Applicant failed to convince me that he did not knowingly and willfully falsify his 
security clearance application.  An applicant may be disqualified if allegations of criminal conduct are raised against him.  &para; E2.A10.1.2.1.  The criminal 
offense was an isolated incident, and therefore mitigating condition E2.A10.1.3.2 applies.  Nonetheless, after weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions, the finding is against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
