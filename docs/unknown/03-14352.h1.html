<P>Applicant's sporadic marijuana use from 1986 to 2002 has not been mitigated because he believes marijuana should be legal and he has provided mixed signals 
about his future intentions of using marijuana. Applicant's attempts to conceal the full picture of his marijuana use over an eleven year period from 1992 until 
2003, support an adverse finding under both the personal conduct and criminal conduct guidelines. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On August 30, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as 
reissued through Change 4 thereto, dated April 20, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR provided reasons why DOHA could 
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for Applicant. On September 20, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. </P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2005, and I convened a hearing on January 25, 2005. The government submitted six exhibits (GE) and Applicant 
submitted one exhibit (AE) containing character references. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 2, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>During the hearing, the Government moved to amend the SOR by changing the date in subparagraphs 2.b. and 2.c. from March 3, 2004 to March 13, 2003 to 
conform the SOR with the evidence presented. The motion was granted. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges drug involvement, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. Applicant denied all factual allegations except for subparagraph 2.c. Applicant 
opined his incorrect "no" answer to question 28 of his March 2003 security clearance application (SCA), generated all the confusion about his past drug use, 
and led to the  allegations under paragraphs 1 and 2, except for subparagraph 2.c. Applicant is 47 years old and has been employed as a computer scientist for a 
defense contractor since January 2001. He seeks a top secret clearance. He has held a security clearance since 1988. </P> 
<P>Applicant has provided conflicting information regarding his marijuana use over the years. While he claims he started using the drug in his freshman year in 
college in 1976 (Tr. 21; 60), three security clearance applications (SCAs) identified as GE 1, GE 2, and GE 3, reflect his first year of college was six years later 
in 1982. Though Applicant testified his next use of marijuana after 1976 was between 1993 and 1996 (Tr. 21), with his last use occurring in 1996, the certified 
results of interview (CRI)<A HREF="03-14352.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> appearing in GE 5 (May 2, 2003), reflects Applicant's sporadic use began in 1986 and did not end until 2002. </P> 
<P>The record evidence supports a finding Applicant used marijuana while possessing a security clearance (subparagraph 1.b. of the SOR), notwithstanding the 
statements in his answer to the contrary. Even without the presence of GE 5 (CRI), Applicant has acknowledged use of marijuana between 1993 and 1996. (Tr. 
21.) GE 2 and GE 3 show Applicant has possessed a security clearance since 1988. Considering  GE 1, GE 2, GE 3, and GE 5, I find Applicant sporadically 
used marijuana from 1988 to 2002 while possessing a security clearance. </P> 
<P>My factual finding Applicant used marijuana longer than he is willing to admit is also based on his opinion of marijuana use. Applicant testified that marijuana 
is naturally created and there is enough scientific evidence demonstrating seriously ill people need the drug. (Tr. 39) He does not feel marijuana use is morally 
wrong. As for the ethical considerations, in Applicant's view it depends on what a person does for a living. (Tr. 37.) Though he will not use marijuana until it 
becomes legal or he gets cancer, he believes marijuana should be legal. (Tr. 37.) Regarding his future intentions of using marijuana (subparagraph 1.c.), 
Applicant stated he would use it in the proper circumstances. (GE 5) However, he testified he did not plan to use the drug in the future because his conscience 
would bother him. He did not explain. (Tr. 61-62.)</P> 
<P>The incorrect information Applicant furnished in at least three SCAs solidifies my finding regarding Applicant's marijuana use until 2002. Applicant completed 
an SCA in July 1992. In response to question 20a. (subparagraph 2.a.), which asked "have you ever tried or used or possessed any narcotic (to include heroin or 
cocaine), depressant (to include quaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to include marijuana or hashish), or any mind 
altering substance (to include glue or paint), even one time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a licensed physician?," Applicant answered 
"no." Applicant claimed he was led to believe his "no"answer to the question was excusable because (1) he was not using the drug at the time (he filled out the 
application) and had not used the drug for over 10 years, (2) he had never been arrested for marijuana use, and (3) he had only used the drug once or twice in 
college (Tr. 23). At the hearing, Applicant realized his "no" answer to question 20a. was a falsehood.</P> 
<P>Applicant was presented with the same question (numbered 27 on this SCA) in his March 13, 2003 SCA (subparagraph 2.b.), and again he provided a "no" 
response. At the hearing, Applicant first denied his drug use occurred within the prior 7 years of March 13, 2003, the date he signed the SCA. Next, he 
contended he really did not know when he had last used marijuana before signing the form in March 2003. (Tr. 27) In response to question 28 (subparagraph 
2.c.) which asked, "have you <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ever</SPAN> illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while 
possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly or immediately affecting public safety?," Applicant answered "no."</P> 
<P>In January 1998, Applicant was asked the same two questions in an SCA and he furnished the same "no" responses. In justification of his "no" answers to both 
questions, Applicant stated: </P> 
<P>I answered those questions no when the answer was yes because I had had a clearance for a long time. I had only recently - -  or I had indulged in it for a few 
periods. I had put it down again, and I just felt, rightly or wrongly, I felt that stirring up a pot would not be in the best interests of me at the time. (Tr. 25.)</P> 
<P>Applicant provided the same "no" answers in an SCA he furnished the Government in March 2002. While Applicant's false answers to questions 27 and 28 of 
his 1998 and 2002 SCAs are not alleged in the SOR, I view these additional falsifications as having an adverse impact on Applicant's overall veracity. </P> 
<P>Applicant claims he answered "no" to SCA question 28 in March 2003 because he wanted a chance to discuss his marijuana use with an investigator. Even 
though Applicant thought the investigator was very nice, polite (Tr. 51), and non-adversarial (Tr. 52) during the interview, when the interview was over and the 
investigator asked him to write a sworn statement, he became agitated. He did not want to write down any information that would be submitted to law 
enforcement agencies (Tr. 51) or could be considered incriminating. (Tr. 52.)<A HREF="03-14352.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Applicant furnished five character statements from coworkers. Three of the coworkers with up to six years of professional contact with Applicant, consider him 
trustworthy and a real professional. Two other character references believe Applicant is a good husband and father. </P> 
<P><STRONG><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given consideration in every case according 
to the pertinent guideline; however, the conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The government must prove controverted facts by substantial evidence. After the government meets its burden, the applicant has the ultimate burden of 
presenting evidence in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation that demonstrates it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a her security 
clearance. Any doubt concerning an applicant's security clearance access should be resolved in favor of national security. <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 
484U.S. 518, at 531.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Illegal involvement with drugs raises security concerns regarding an individual's willingness to protect classified information.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
<P>Conduct involving questionable judgment or dishonesty may indicate the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>A history or pattern of criminal conduct raises security concerns about a person's judgment and trustworthiness.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG>. Drug abuse or dependence can impair social or occupational functioning and may lead to the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information. The government has established a case under the drug involvement (DI) guideline. DI disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM>any drug use</EM>) 
applies. Applicant has used drugs sporadically since 1986 to 2002. In addition, from 1988 to 2002, Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance. 
DI DC E2.A8.1.2.5. (<EM>recent drug involvement, especially following the granting of a security clearance, or an expressed intent not to discontinue use, will 
almost invariably result in an unfavorable determination</EM>) also applies.</P> 
<P>Even though Applicant's last documented marijuana use occurred in 2002, DI mitigating condition (MC) E8.1.3.1. (<EM>the drug involvement was not recent</EM>) fails 
to overcome Applicant's history of marijuana use between 1986 and 2002. The duration of Applicant's drug use militates against the application of DI MC 
E2.A8.1.3.2. (<EM>the drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event</EM>). Given the circumstances of this case, Applicant's stated intention to forego 
marijuana use in the future does not constitute enough evidence under DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3. (<EM>a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>). In view 
of Applicant's opinion that marijuana should be legal, and Applicant's poor credibility coupled with his representations he would use the drug in the proper 
circumstances, more evidence is needed to convince me Applicant has not used marijuana since 2002 and will not resort to drug use in the future. </P> 
<P>Applicant's deliberate omissions of his marijuana use from his SCA in 1992 and 2003 establishes personal conduct (PC) DC E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>the deliberate 
omission of relevant material facts from a personnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance eligibility</EM>). The deliberate but unalleged 
falsifications of his 1998 and 2002 SCAs demonstrate the magnitude of Applicant's resolve to keep his post-1996 marijuana use a secret. All mitigating 
conditions under PC have been considered, but none are applicable because of Applicant's continuing refusal to admit the full nature and scope of his drug use. 
PC MC E2.A5.1.3.2. (<EM>the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has provided correct information voluntarily</EM>) does not apply 
to mitigate because Applicant's deliberate omissions were not isolated, and Applicant continues to deny he omitted any information about his history of drug 
use. </P> 
<P>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3. (<EM>the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>) is not applicable on 
these facts as Applicant continues to deny he used marijuana as set forth in GE 5. Rather, his consistently dishonest answers reflect how committed he is to not 
revealing any information that could pose adverse consequences to his interests, presumably in keeping his security clearance. </P> 
<P>Applicant claims he relied on the representations made by his security officer which resulted in the deliberate omissions from his SCA in 1992. E2.A5.1.3.4. 
(<EM>omission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted 
information was promptly and fully provided</EM>). The foregoing condition must be ruled out for mitigation because Applicant was 32 years old when he filled out 
the form in 1992. He had already had a security clearance for four years. Even though Applicant may have relied on the security officer, commonsense should 
have guided him to provide truthful information on the security form. Finally, Applicant continues to deny the full history of his drug use. The pattern of 
falsifications from 1992 to the present requires a formal finding against Applicant under the PC guideline.</P> 
<P>His pattern of deliberate omissions also constitutes violations of Federal law, 18 United States Code (U.S.C.) 1001, under the criminal conduct (CC) guideline. 
E2.A10.1.2.1. (<EM>allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was ever charged</EM>). Applicant's past deliberate omissions of drug 
use is material information the Government has a legitimate right to know about in order to make an informed decision about Applicant's security 
qualifications. </P> 
<P>Because Applicant's last deliberate omission occurred in March 2003, less than two years ago, coupled with Applicant's continuing denial of the full scope of 
his drug use, E2.A10.1.3.1. (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM>) is not applicable to mitigate. E2.A10.1.3.2. <EM>(the crime was an isolated incident</EM>) is also not 
available to mitigate the record's pattern of deliberate misconduct. Applicant's decision not to admit his drug use means that he remains outside the mitigating 
reach of CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>). In sum, Applicant's positive job performance evidence does not overcome 
his drug involvement, personal conduct and criminal conduct. In finding against Applicant under the specific guidelines, I have also considered this case under 
the whole person factors of the whole person concept. E2.2.1. Given Applicant's drug use and repeated efforts to conceal the extent of his drug use, Applicant 
has provided insufficient evidence under factor 6 (<EM>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</EM>) and factor 9 (<EM>the likelihood 
of continuation or recurrence</EM>) to conclude his drug use and willingness to deceive the government will not recur in the future. </P>
