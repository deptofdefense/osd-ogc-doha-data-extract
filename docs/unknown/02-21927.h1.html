<P>Applicant is a 51-year-old naturalized citizen of the United States.  He was born in Saudi Arabia and came to the U.S. in 1980 on a Saudi scholarship.  He has 
worked for defense contractors since 1992, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1997.  Applicant twice used his Saudi passport to return to that country for 
personal visits since becoming a U.S. citizen, but has since renounced his Saudi citizenship and returned the passport.  Applicant's mother, three brothers, and 
two sisters live in Saudi Arabia.  He also has extensive ties to the United States, including his spouse, his professional career, and substantial financial interests.  
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from the possible foreign preference and foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 6, 2002, Applicant submitted a security clearance application.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, 
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the 
"Directive").  On August 25, 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised 
under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, Guideline C, Foreign Preference, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 2, 2003.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  On October 20, 2003, Applicant 
submitted an amended answer to the SOR.</P> 
<P>The case was assigned to me on August 18, 2004.  With the concurrence of the parties, I conducted the hearing on September 27, 2004.  At the outset of the 
hearing, Government counsel moved to withdraw the allegations under Guideline E, without objection, and I granted the motion.  The government presented 
nine exhibits.  Applicant's counsel presented eight exhibits, the testimony of two witnesses, and Applicant's testimony on his own behalf.  DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) on October 7, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant denied the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.b, and 3.a of the SOR.  Amended Answer to SOR, dated October 20, 2003.  He admitted the factual allegations in 
&para;&para; 2.a, 2.b (in part), and 2.c of the SOR, with explanations.  <EM>Id.  </EM>Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough

overseas, specializing in the topic of democracy and Islam.  Tr. at 83-84.  She has made several government-sponsored trips overseas to speak to foreign 
audiences on related subjects.  Tr. at 84-85.</P> 
<P>Applicant's father worked for an Arabian and American oil company in Saudi Arabia all his adult life until he retired.  Tr. at 32.  He then began an ironwork 
shop, which he ran until he passed away in January 2000.  <EM>Id.</EM>; Tr. at 11.  </P> 
<P>Applicant's mother is 70 years old and a retired homemaker living in Saudi Arabia with one of Applicant's brothers.  Tr. at 32, 33, 51; Ex. 1 at 8.  She has no 
ties to the government.  Tr. at 32.  Applicant has seen his mother twice in the last four years.  Tr. at 34.  His mother and one of his sisters came to visit him in

U.S. more frequently, and Applicant sees him during layovers.  Tr. at 35.  Applicant has not seen his other two brothers in four years.  <EM>Id.</EM>  </P> 
<P>Applicant traveled to Saudi Arabia twice since becoming a U.S. citizen.  Tr. at 39.  In 1999, he elected to travel to the mid-east to join his wife for a part of her 
government-sponsored lecture tour.  Tr. at 39.  He used the opportunity to visit his family in Saudi Arabia.  Ex. 1 at 11.  Because Applicant decided to travel on 
short notice-leaving no time to obtain a visa for Saudi Arabia-he traveled on his Saudi Arabian passport.  Tr. at 39.</P> 
<P>Applicant's second trip to Saudi Arabia since becoming a U.S. citizen occurred in January 2000, when Applicant's father passed away.  Tr. at 40.  The Saudi

of a Saudi national who has become a U.S. citizen.  <EM>Id. </EM>at 2<EM>.  </EM>The United States and Saudi Arabia enjoy good relations.  Ex. II at 7.  Mutual concern about 
regional security, oil exports, and sustainable development have resulted in close economic and security ties.  <EM>Id.</EM>  The United States remains concerned about 
human rights conditions in Saudi Arabia, including abuse of prisoners, restrictions on speech, press, assembly, and association, discrimination against women 
and minorities, and suppression of worker's rights.   <EM>Id.</EM> at 8.  The U.S. is also concerned about terrorists in Saudi Arabia targeting American travelers.  Exs. III, 
IV, V at 6-7, VI at 4-5.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength 
of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, 
and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a 
clearance.</P> 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
<P>Guideline <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">B, Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, or other persons to whom he may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for 
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries 
are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline C, Foreign Preference:  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she 
may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C, Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets out circumstances that could indicate a disqualifying foreign preference.  Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.2.  Under &para; E2.A3.1.2.1, "[t]he exercise of 
dual citizenship" may be disqualifying.  Similarly, &para; E2.A3.1.2.2 indicates that the "[p]ossession and use of a foreign passport" may show a potentially 
disqualifying foreign preference.  In this case, Applicant used his foreign passport twice after becoming a U.S. citizen.  The use of a foreign passport is an 
exercise of the rights and privileges of a citizen of that foreign country.  ISCR Case No. 98-0252 at pp. 7-8 (App. Bd. Sept. 15, 1999).  Applicant's admissions 
are substantial evidence supporting these two potentially disqualifying conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive also sets out conditions that could mitigate security concerns related to foreign preference.  Under &para; E2.A3.1.3.1, it may be mitigating where 
"[d]ual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country."  Applicant became a citizen of Saudi Arabia because of his birth to 
Saudi parents in that country.  However, he also exercised his Saudi citizenship when he used his Saudi passport after obtaining U.S. citizenship.  ISCR Case 
No. 98-0252, <EM>supra</EM>.  I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It may also be mitigating where the activity in question is "sanctioned by the United States."  Directive, &para; E2.A3.1.3.3.  Applicant used his Saudi passport to 
travel to Saudi Arabia on two occasions.  United States' law does not prohibit a U.S. citizen from holding or using a foreign passport; however, recognizing that 
it is lawful is not the same as sanctioning the practice.  Here, the United States did not direct, request, or require Applicant to use his foreign passport, it merely 
allowed Applicant to exercise his rights.  I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, it may be mitigating where an "[i]ndividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship."  Applicant renounced his Saudi citizenship 
unequivocally and returned his passport to that country.  Ex. C.  Moreover, he has chosen to live in the United States for the greater part of his adult life, his 
wife is a U.S. citizen, he and his wife have risen to positions of responsibility and respect in their career fields, and he has all his assets here.  I conclude this 
mitigating condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully considered all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the "whole person"concept.  I conclude that Applicant has mitigated 
the security concerns arising from his previous exercise of dual citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B, Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual 
has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country<EM>.</EM>"  Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family 
members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Applicant has a mother, three brothers, and two sisters who are citizens 
and residents of Saudi Arabia.  Applicant maintains regular contact with his mother and siblings.  These circumstances "could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information."  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  I conclude this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.2.3 of the Directive, it may be disqualifying where, "[r]elatives . . . are connected with any foreign government."  Two of Applicant's brothers 
are pilots for the national airline and Applicant's sisters worked for the national school system.  I find this potentially disqualifying condition applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These security concerns can be mitigated where it is determined that "the immediate family members . . . are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United States."  Directive, &para; 
E2.A2.1.3.1.  Two of Applicant's brothers are employed by the national airline, and two sisters worked for the public school system, agencies controlled by the 
government.  None of Applicant's brother or sisters are members of the ruling family or the government.  There is no evidence indicating any one of them is an 
"agent of a foreign power."  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C.A. &sect; 1801(b).<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In assessing whether an applicant is vulnerable to exploitation through relatives in a foreign country, it is helpful to consider several factors, including the 
character of the government of the relevant foreign country.  Saudi Arabia is a monarchy founded upon Islamic law.  Many aspects of Saudi legal traditions are 
inconsistent with the human rights embraced by the United States, including its treatment of women, prisoners, and minorities, and its protection of speech, 
press, assembly, and association.  At the same time, Saudi interests in oil exports and the regional stability essential to that end have made it an ally of the 
United States in security, trade, and other political interests. <STRONG> </STRONG>Under the circumstances, the possibility that the government would attempt to exploit or pressure 
its residents to act adversely to the interests of the United States is limited.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives in Saudi Arabia.<STRONG>  </STRONG>As noted above, Applicant's brother and sisters are not and have 
never been employed by the Saudi military forces.  Applicant's sisters and two brothers have worked for organizations controlled by the government, 
specifically, the school system and the national airline.  Applicant's other brother operates an independent family business, and his mother is retired.  Under 
these circumstances, there is some opportunity for adverse influence against Applicant's relatives in Saudi Arabia.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to pressure or duress applied indirectly through his ties with his relatives.  Applicant maintains regular 
contact with his mother, sisters and brothers.  I find he is bound by close ties of obligation and affection to his relatives in Saudi Arabia.  At the same time, he 
has extensive ties to the United States.  Applicant has now lived here most of his adult life, his spouse is a citizen and resident of the U.S., and all his financial 
interests are in the United States.  He has worked for defense contractors for many years and was previously granted access to confidential material without 
adverse incident.  Considering the extent of his ties to the United States, I find Applicant is not vulnerable to pressure or duress.  I conclude the mitigating 
condition set out in &para; E2.A2.1.3.1 of the Directive applies.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A2.1.3.3 of the Directive, it may also be mitigating where "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  
Applicant has not seen his relatives in Saudi Arabia very frequently in the last four years.  However, he maintains regular telephonic contact.  As mentioned 
above, he sees one of his brothers from time to time when he comes to the U.S. on business.  I conclude this mitigating condition does not apply.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts and circumstances in this case in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated any potential 
security concerns arising from Applicant's family ties to Saudi Arabia.</SPAN></P>
