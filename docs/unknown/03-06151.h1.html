<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is employed by a U.S. defense contractor and is also a Navy reservist. She married a citizen of Pakistan but did not report it to her employer until 18 
months later. Although she separated from her husband in 2001, she has taken no steps to divorce him. Her husband has a mother, two brothers and a sister who 
are citizens of, and reside in, Pakistan. She has had no contact with her husband or his relatives for over two years. Applicant made a false statement to a 
Defense Security Service investigator on September 21, 2001, that her husband was only her fianc&eacute;. The INS concluded in 2003 that her marriage was 
fraudulent and was entered into for the purpose of circumventing U.S. immigration laws. Clearance is denied. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry ,</EM>as<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN>amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement, dated July 27, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned 
to me on October 1, 2004. A Notice of Hearing was issued on October 6, 2004 and the hearing was held on November 10, 2004. The Government introduced 
nine exhibits at the hearing and all were accepted into evidence. The Applicant testified on her own behalf. The SOR Par. 2.b. was amended at the hearing to 
conform to the evidence presented.  The transcript was received on November 19, 2004. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 50 years old and has been employed by a U.S. defense contractor since February, 2000. She is also a Navy reservist with a college degree in special 
education.</P> 
 
<P>On March 17, 2000, at age 46 she married a citizen of Pakistan who had worked for the Government of Pakistan before entering the U.S. This was her first 
marriage but she did not report it to her employer until approximately one year and a half later. Although she separated from her husband in 2001 because they 
could not agree of where to live, and it had become apparent to her that he had married her to obtain a green card and U.S. citizenship, she has taken no steps 
since the separation to divorce him. In January 2003 he was denied an immediate relative visa by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). </P> 
 
<P>Her husband has a mother, two brothers and a sister who are citizens of, and reside in, Pakistan. Applicant  has had no contact with her husband or his relatives 
for over two years. She does not know where her husband is living or whether he is still in the United States.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant made a false statement to a Defense Security Service investigator on September 21, 2001, saying that her husband was only her fianc&eacute;. The INS 
concluded in 2003 that her marriage was fraudulent and entered into for the purpose of circumventing U.S. immigration laws. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence</P> 
 
<P>of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do 
so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The 
applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt 
as to</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The applicable Guidelines cited in the SOR concern the following Disqualifying Conditions (DC): </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence-Guideline B:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including co-habitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual 
potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. (E2.A2.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of  affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country. 
(E2.A2.1.2.1)Possible mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the immediate family members would not constitute an 
unacceptable security risk (E2.A2.1.3.1) and that contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. (E2.A2.1.3.3)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant's admissions, the Government established reasons to deny her a security clearance because of foreign 
influence. Having established such reasons, the Applicant had the burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or 
extenuates the disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424 
(App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. She is still married to a citizen of Pakistan who has four close relatives living there. Even though Applicant has had no contact with 
her husband or his relatives for two years she remains married to him and the fact that she has taken no positive steps to legally terminate the relationship leaves 
her vulnerable to threats and undue persuasion. Mitigating factors are not applicable.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal Conduct-Guideline E:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations 
could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. The following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or 
administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility. (E2.A5.1.1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Refusal to complete required security forms, releases, or provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security officials or other 
official representatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. (E2.A5.1.1.2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trust-worthiness determination. (E2.A5.1.2.3)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail. (E2.A5.1.2.4.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress. (E2.A5.1.3.5.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the fact that Applicant has had no contact with her husband or his relatives for two years might indicate that the mitigating condition was applicable, the 
fact that she is still married to him and has taken no steps to divorce him makes the condition inapplicable. Her failure to report the marriage to her employer 
promptly and to mislead the investigator also are factors considered. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that she made several serious 
errors in judgment and continues to do so, and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.</SPAN></P>
