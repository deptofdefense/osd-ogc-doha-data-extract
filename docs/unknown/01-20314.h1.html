<P>Applicant's more than 30 years of marijuana abuse was not mitigated where Applicant used marijuana in the mid-1980s while in a cleared status, retained his 
clearance in1992 based on his cessation of marijuana abuse in 1985, but resumed and increased his drug abuse in 1994--while still in a cleared status--when 
he used marijuana to self-medicate his sexual dysfunction, without regard for its illegality or its prohibition by both company and government policy. 
Applicant's violation of company sexual harassment policy and misuse of company computers to send nude photographs over the internet cast additional doubt 
on his fitness for access to classified information. Clearance denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 9 August 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-20314.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</SPAN> On 5 
September 2002, Applicant answered the SOR and requested an administrative determination on the record. He later changed his mind and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on 7 January 2003 and received by me the same day. On 10 January 2003, I set the case for hearing, and issued a Notice of 
Hearing (NOH) on 13 January 2003 for a hearing on 28 January 2003. On 27 January 2003, Applicant requested a continuance to obtain counsel. I granted the 
continuance, and on 24 February 2003 issued a second NOH setting the case for hearing on 11 March 2003.</P> 
<P>At the hearing, the government presented five exhibits--admitted without objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented eight exhibits--seven admitted 
without objection, one admitted over objection--and the testimony of four witnesses, including himself. DOHA received the transcript on 19 March 2003.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR, except for subparagraphs 1.e. and 2.a. and c.; accordingly, I incorporate those allegations as findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant--a fifty-seven-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks to retain the access to classified information he has had since approximately 1982. 
He has a doctoral degree in mechanical engineering and has been with his current employer, albeit not always in the same location, since approximately January 
1981.</P> 
<P>Applicant has an extensive history of marijuana abuse--at various frequencies over the years, to include periods of abstinence--going back to 1967. He 
acknowledges that his marijuana use was illegal at all times he used it, as well as contrary to both company and government policy after he obtained his 
clearance, regardless of whether his use occurred on duty or off (Tr. 64; 91-92).</P> 
<P>Applicant began using marijuana in approximately 1967, and used it what he described as "experimentally" until approximately 1971, during his undergraduate 
years. He went to work for his current employer in approximately January 1981 and obtained his first security clearance in approximately February 1982. He 
has been an exemplary employee for his company for over 20 years (A.E. E).</P> 
<P>On 14 September 1992, Applicant executed a Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ)(DD Form 398)(G.E. 5) to begin a periodic reinvestigation of his 
clearance. He truthfully answered "yes" to two questions requiring him to disclose his history of drug use/possession (question 22.a.) and his history of drug 
activity (question 22.b), and with the attention to detail typical of engineers<A HREF="01-20314.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> described both:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On 21 January 1993, Applicant gave a sworn statement to the Defense Security Service (DSS)(G.E. 4) that confirmed the above drug involvement and 
acknowledged Applicant's understanding that his security clearance required him to remain drug free:<A HREF="01-20314.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I listed my total involvement with illegal drugs on my PSQ and I have previously been interviewed by DIS concerning this involvement. I have not used or in 
any way been involved with illegal drugs since that which I reported on my PSQ and I don't intend to be in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant apparently remained drug free until some time in 1994, when he met the woman he would marry in July 1995. They met at a party in early 1994 and 
began dating. When they decided to become intimate, Applicant told her about his sexual dysfunction. Although she had used marijuana only "minimally" 
before (Tr. 102-103), she suggested that marijuana might relax him and at least lessen his "performance anxiety." He tried it and found that it worked to 
improve his sexual performance. For the year and a half that they dated before marrying, Applicant and his spouse used marijuana approximately once per 
month before sexual relations, because she lived in another state and they only got together once per month. After they married, they used marijuana 
approximately once per week before sexual relations. They used a small pipe to smoke the marijuana (Tr. 95, 105). He used enough to get a "buzz." She used 
marijuana to keep him company and share the moment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On 20 March 2001, Applicant provided another sworn statement to the DSS (G.E. 2) describing his more recent drug abuse (in his own handwriting):</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Having admitted to the occasional use of the illegal drug, marijuana, the following elaboration is provided: My use of marijuana is limited to sharing small 
quantities with my wife in the privacy of our home, usually in connection with intimate relations. Typical use is 3-4 times a month, always on weekends, since 
our marriage in July, 1995. I have never used marijuana at work, during working hours, or during the week when my performance at work could be 
compromised. I have never used marijuana in quantities sufficient to impair judgment, nor do I drive a motor vehicle or operate tools or machinery while under 
the influence of any substance, legal or illegal.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On several occasions I have purchased small quantities of marijuana (less than 1 ounce) for personal consumption. Such quantities typically last 2-3 years at our 
rate of consumption. I have never purchased marijuana with the intent to sell or otherwise profit from the purchase. I have never used, purchased, sold or 
otherwise trafficked in any other illegal drug.<A HREF="01-20314.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant now insists that he stopped using marijuana in approximately mid- 2000 (Tr.64), only bought marijuana once (not including the purchase of one joint 
while in vacation in the Caribbean in 1998 (Tr. 93), and will not use marijuana in the future (Tr. 68). He acknowledged that he has made a similar statement in 
the past and returned to marijuana abuse (Tr. 68-69). Although he does not remember making the 1992 drug disclosures, he acknowledges that the information 
on his PSQ could only have come from him and his recollection of his drug abuse between 1967 and 1985 would have been better in 1992 than 2000 (Tr. 111-113).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided urinalysis testing results demonstrating that he tested negative for marijuana metabolite on 6 drug screens that he took between 28 January 
2003 and 4 March 2003 (A.E. F). He has never been subjected to a random drug screening at work (Tr. 64).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On 30 October 2000, Applicant was disciplined by his employer for violating company sexual harassment policy and for misuse of company email systems 
(G.E. 3). Applicant brought in a picture portfolio that included nude photographs to show them to a coworker who had expressed an interest in posing (not 
necessarily nude) for him. Another employee overhead the conversation, was offended, and reported Applicant to management. During the company 
investigation, Applicant acknowledged sending nude photographs via company email to the woman (not a company employee) who had posed for them.<A HREF="01-20314.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had several extra-marital affairs in the 1980s (Tr. 44) that were a contributing factor in his 1990 divorce from his first wife. This conduct was 
adjudicated in his 1992 periodic reinvestigation (G. E. 5).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's character references consider him an extremely honest and trustworthy person. They believe his past abuse of marijuana is no impediment to his 
having a clearance. Both have had clearances themselves and are aware that marijuana use is illegal, contrary to most company drug abuse policies, and 
contrary to government policy for both cleared and uncleared employees and for cleared contractor personnel. One is president of his small company, a 
company that prohibits all illegal drug use by its employees on-duty or off- (Tr. 28-29).</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the 
applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline H, and Applicant has not mitigated the conduct. Applicant abused marijuana, on and off, for more than 
thirty years, from 1967 to at least 2001.<A HREF="01-20314.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Clearly, the illegality of the conduct did not affect Applicant's decision to use marijuana. Nor did his cleared status 
affect his decision to use marijuana. Although he obtained a clearance in 1981 he used and purchased marijuana until 1985. He ceased his marijuana use in 
1985 and the period of abstinence between then and his periodic reinvestigation in 1992 made Applicant eligible to continue his clearance. However, Applicant 
obtained his renewal 1992 based on his assurances that he would not use drugs in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite that assurance, he resumed marijuana use in 1994, and became a regular user of marijuana. That he did so only with his wife in the intimacy of his 
sexual relations with her is beside the point. Applicant's drug abuse was recent and it was neither isolated nor aberrational. The fact that his drug abuse was 
confined to a particular set of circumstances does not lessen its security significance. On the many occasions when he use marijuana he put himself potentially 
at risk to disclose classified information. The illegality of his conduct, and the policy proscriptions of both employer and government, played little in 
Applicant's decision to use. Applicant stated an intent to refrain from drug use in 1992, and he  demonstrated an intent to refrain from drug abuse in the future 
by the most important means: by having not used drugs for more than seven years at the time, and continuing drug free until 1994 or so. He has again stated an 
intent to refrain from drugs in the future--and has been drug free for approximately 24 months<A HREF="01-20314.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>--but I cannot conclude that he has demonstrated an intent to 
refrain under the circumstances of this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It may appear that Applicant is unlikely to use marijuana in the future, now that his sexual dysfunction is being addressed by Viagra. But as noted above, 
Applicant's resumed and continued marijuana abuse even though aware of the illegality and policy proscription of drug abuse. Further, Applicant's similar 
claim in 1986 got him a clearance then, yet he returned to marijuana use after being granted a clearance. The appropriate disqualifying condition suggests that 
under these circumstances, a clearance will almost invariably be revoked. There is nothing in the record to suggest that his is the case for variation. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> In addition, 
10 U.S.C. &sect;986 prohibits renewal of a clearance held by person who is a user of illegal</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> drugs. Given his extensive history of marijuana abuse and its recency I 
conclude that Applicant is a user of illegal drugs. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline H. against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has also established its case under Guideline E. Although Applicant's disciplinary action for misuse of company email and violation of its 
sexual harassment policy is comparatively minor, it nevertheless demonstrates Applicant's poor judgment and willingness to bend the rules to his own 
purposes. Similarly, Applicant's ongoing drug use in the face of known legal and policy proscriptions demonstrates his unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations. However, I consider Applicant's past affairs to have no security significance for this adjudication, both because of the prior adjudication and the 
passage of twenty years without additional misconduct. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline E. against Applicant.</SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992--and amended by Change 3 dated 16 February 1996, and by Change 4 
dated 20 April 1999 (Directive).

<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A fact Applicant acknowledged at hearing as well (Tr. 91-92). 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Noticeably absent from this statement is any claim, now made by Applicant at hearing (Tr. 64), that he had stopped using marijuana shortly after he began treatment for his sexual dysfunction 
in January 2000 (confirmed by A.E. G) and obtained a prescription for Viagra (prescription confirmed by A.E. G, but not the date of prescription), vitiating any need to continue his marijuana 
use. Applicant also claimed (Tr. 71-72) that he described his marijuana use in language that suggested continuing use because he has a great bias in favor of active voice in his writing. This 
claim is incredible for a two reasons. First, the statement consists largely of passive voice sentences that nevertheless describe his drug use as continuing into March 2001. Second, he confuses 
active voice with present tense. "I stopped using marijuana in January 2000" is a perfectly good active voice sentence that is nevertheless past tense. I conclude that Applicant did not include 
such a sentence in his March 2001 sworn statement because he had not, in fact, stopped using marijuana then. The SOR alleges--and Applicant admits--marijuana abuse to at least March 
2001. Applicant's first claim to have ceased marijuana abuse, and his first report of medical treatment for his sexual dysfunction, appears in his September 2002 answer. 
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant claims that his conduct did not violate company policy (Tr. 45-51; A.E. A, B, C) because the person he showed the portfolio to was not offended, and the complainant was not the 
alleged "victim" (A.E. D). However, the company concluded otherwise. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under the provisions of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>10 U.S.C. 986</EM>, any person who is an unlawful user of. . . a controlled substance s defined in section 107 of the Controlled Substances Act (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>21 U.S.C. 802</EM>) may not be 
granted or have renewed access to classified information (Footnote in original).

guidance that cases not be evaluated in a piecemeal fashion. 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I conclude that Applicant used marijuana at least as late as his March 2001 sworn statement, notwithstanding his assertions that he stopped using marijuana shortly after he was prescribed 
Viagra for his sexual dysfunction. After at least six years of regular marijuana use, it was part of their bedroom ritual; there's no reason to assume they stopped using marijuana just because the 
Viagra was effective
