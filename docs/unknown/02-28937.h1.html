<P>Applicant, a 29-year-old engineer, had three criminal charges relating to or as a result of alcohol use, while a university student. The latest was in 2001. They 
were mitigated by passage of time and change of lifestyle. Clearance in granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On April 19, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on December 22, 2004. A notice of hearing 
was issued on January 13, 2005, and a hearing was held on February 23, 2005. Four government exhibits and 14 Applicant exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. The Applicant testified. The transcript was received on March 8, 2005.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a defense contractor who had alcohol-related offenses in 1997, 1998, and 2001. Applicant admitted all of the specific 
allegations relating to his alcohol related incidents, but denied drinking to excess since 2002 when his professional career as a mechanical engineer began after 
college graduation. </P> 
<P>Applicant over-indulged in alcohol as a high school student and while in college. In 1997 he was charged with after hours consumption of alcohol and fined 
$50.00. A year later he was charged with driving while intoxicated and given Probation Before Judgment, placed on a one year supervised probation, fined 
$355.00 and ordered to enroll in and complete an alcohol class which he did with Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). </P> 
<P>Applicant's last encounter with law enforcement occurred when he was a few months short of college graduation in 2001. He was arrested on his campus after 
an out-of-town basketball game against a traditional rival. Some disorderly celebrations occurred after the game. Applicant had watched the game on television 
in a bar, consumed several beers, and was walking home when he came upon a campus bonfire. He went towards the bonfire to see what was happening. 
Unbeknownst to him the area had been the site of a campus riot and police had dispersed the crowd but were present. He approached a policeman who pointed a 
weapon at him. Applicant flexed his muscles and was shot several times with a pepper ball gun, arrested and charged with second degree assault, resisting 
arrest, failure to obey a lawful order, and disorderly conduct. He admits the incident and states that it was a totally stupid thing to do. The charges were placed 
on the inactive docket and no action was ever taken. </P> 
<P>Since graduation three months after the 2001 arrest, Applicant has been successfully employed by a company doing contract work on government programs. He 
is well regarded by his employer, his colleagues, family, and friends (Exhs. A-N). He has not had any further incidents involving alcohol or criminal activity 
since 2001. He has changed his lifestyle, become a home-owner, and drinks only an occasional beer at social events. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 
531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has cited a Disqualifying Condition (DC) pursuant to the Directive concerning alcohol under Guideline G. This relates to excessive alcohol 
consumption (E2.A7.1.1) and alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence or other criminal incidents. (E2.A7.1.2.2.) 
itigating factors could include  the fact that the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no current problem (E2.A7.1.3.2.), and that there have 
been positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All three incidents occurred over four years ago. While Applicant should have learned from the first two incidents and the MADD counseling that drinking 
could lead to legal problems, he did get involved in the 2001 incident. He did not learn the lesson and the last incident was the most egregious of the three 
incidents. However, even that one is now over four years old and his record since that time is clear of any incidents that might call his judgment into question. 
He has been gainfully employed in his profession with the same company since college graduation and has been become a stable member of his community. 
From the documents presented at the hearing and the testimony of the Applicant, I conclude that enough time has elapse and sufficient changes in his lifestyle 
have occurred that the mitigating factors are applicable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant is an impressive person of talent 
who has risen in his company to a responsible position. He expresses regret for his conduct. After considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an 
integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude Applicant's overall record of good conduct justifies a finding that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant a security clearance to him.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline G:  FOR APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
