</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations. He has compounded his financial problems with his repeated yet empty promises for over two 
years to repay his overdue debts. Given this pattern of inaction for more than two years, Applicant's payment of one of the creditors in late October 2004, 
coupled with his decision to enroll in the debt consolidation plan, are insufficient to overcome his history of financial difficulties. Conversely, the record lacks 
sufficient evidence of deliberateness to warrant a finding against Applicant under the personal conduct guideline. Clearance is denied. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 7, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, amended through Change 4, April 20, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR also recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed his Answer to the SOR on May 27, 2004. Applicant elected to have his case decided on a written record. The Government provided a copy of 
the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 27, 2004. Applicant received the FORM on October 4, 2004. His response is dated October 29, 2004. The 
case was assigned to me for decision on November 16, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Pursuant to E3.1.7., subparagraph 3.a. of the SOR is amended by changing the date July 1, 2002, to June 28, 2002, to conform the SOR with the evidence 
presented. A review of the security clearance application (SCA), which is item 4 of the Government's FORM, and the subject matter of the allegation in 3.a., 
shows that the SCA is dated June 28, 2002, not July 1, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations under the financial guideline. He claimed subparagraph 1.a. and 1.e. are the same debts as 
are 1.b. and 1.f.<A HREF="03-00759.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> He denied he deliberately failed to disclose information (subparagraph 2.a.) in response to question 39 of his security clearance application 
(SCA) dated July 1, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 29 years old and employed as a network specialist by a defense contractor. He seeks a secret security clearance. Applicant's SCA, dated June 28, 
2002 (Item 4), indicates Applicant was on active duty in the military from 1993 to 2002; he held a secret security clearance during the period. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 28, 2002, Applicant signed his SCA. In response to Question 39, requiring information of debts over 90 days delinquent, Applicant answered "no," 
explaining he was unaware of the overdue debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 30, 2002 (sworn statement, Item 5), Applicant explained the bills listed in the SOR became delinquent because (1) he had to pay too much 
money in moving from the local area to another location in the middle Atlantic region; (2) he discovered when he got to his destination, the cost of living was 
higher than in the local area; and (3) it took his wife some time to find employment at the new location. In Applicant's personal financial statement (attached to 
his sworn statement), he indicated he had $500.00 left over every month after he paid all bills and expenses. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In Item 5 (sworn statement dated September 30, 2002), Applicant also outlined the steps he was going to take to pay the past due debts. He intended to contact 
the creditors in the next 30 days to discuss settlements or payoffs because (1) he was in better financial shape, (2) he moved to more affordable rental 
accommodations, and (3) his wife was working, although she was scheduled to take time off from work for about two months, and then return to work in 
January 2003. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 11, 2003 (Item 6, interrogatory answers), Applicant was asked to provided updated information regarding his efforts to resolve the debts identified 
in subparagraph 1.a., 1.d., and 1.e. Applicant claimed he discovered the creditor in 1.a. was willing to set up a payment plan, but he had not made contact with 
the creditor to commence payments under the plan. Applicant claimed the creditors in 1.d. and 1.e. consented to a payment plan of $400.00 a month that he was 
scheduled to start in November 2003. Applicant also stated he would pay an unlisted creditor in November 2003. However, between October 2003 and May 
2004, Applicant had not paid any of the creditors.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the FORM, dated October 29, 2003, Applicant explained he was involved in an auto accident in December 2002 that totaled his car. The 
money he was going to use to resolve the SOR debts he had to use to purchase transportation for his wife in October 2003. In addition, his wife's surgery kept 
her out of work longer than anticipated and she encountered trouble finding a job. Applicant repeated his intention to repay his past due debts. To bolster his 
claim, Applicant enrolled in a credit consolidation plan to pay off the delinquent creditors. According to Applicant, the plan will pay all the debts in nine 
months. However, no payments have been made under the plan. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, Applicant's credibility is undercut by his repeated promises to pay his debts for over two years. Applicant made a strong 
representation in September 2002 when he provided a sworn statement that because of his improved financial position, he would have no trouble making 
contact with his over-due creditors and resolving his debts. One year later in October 2003, he claimed he made contact with the three of the creditors and was 
about to launch a repayment plan that would require him to pay $400.00 a month. However, he provided no evidence of payment of any of the past due debts. 
Applicant's answer in May 2004 reflects he had not provided documentation to prove he had paid any of his creditors. Applicant did not provide any evidence 
of payment until October 28, 2004, more than two years after he promised to make his creditors whole. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant indicated there were a lot of physical hardships in the military that resulted in his current debt. He did not explain what those hardships were and their 
precise impact on his financial status. He believes he is working on a software program that will bring invaluable dividends to the military planning structure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy conditions which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance decisions. These conditions 
must be considered in every case according to the pertinent guideline; however, the factors are in no way <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">automatically</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">determinative</SPAN> of the decision in any case 
nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations </STRONG>(Guideline F)</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern of this guideline is that individuals who are financially overextended place themselves at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The concern of this guideline is deliberately providing false information during a security investigation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts by substantial evidence. Once the Government meets its burden, the burden shifts to applicant to 
rebut, refute, explain, mitigate, or extenuate the facts. An applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to demonstrate he qualifies for a security clearance. 
Any doubt concerning an applican's security clearance access should be resolved in favor of national security.<EM> Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, at 
531</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The circumstances of this case invoke the financial considerations disqualifying condition (FI DC) E2.A.6.1.2.1. (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) 
because there are six debts that have been delinquent since 1991 and 1992. The total delinquent amount is about $17,300.00. Applicant's repeated promises to 
pay the debts between September 2002 and October 2004 require the application of FC DC E2.A6.1.2.2. (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>). Initially, 
Applicant was unable to repay the past due debts, but his improved financial status over the last two years, i.e., the $500.00 monthly remainder he had in 
September 2002, should have persuaded him to resolve the smaller debts to demonstrate he was truly committed to eliminating the debt delinquencies.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are five FC mitigating conditions (MC) that are potentially applicable to the circumstances of this case. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.1. <EM>(the behavior was not 
recent</EM>) applies in a limited fashion as all the debts became delinquent in 1991 and 1992. Even though the debts became delinquent in 1991 and 1992, the fact 
there are still six debts totaling more than $17,300.00 requires FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>) to be dismissed due to inapplicability.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control</EM>) applies to unforeseen events that arise to interfere 
with a person's ability to pay his or her debts. Inordinate moving expenses, compounded by a higher cost of living, and his wife's inability to get employment 
immediately are unfortunate events that can hinder a person's ability to pay his bills. However, higher moving expenses to a location with a higher cost of living 
are facts of life that can be reduced in amounts during the planning stage by choosing less costly movers and moving to a area with a lower cost of living as 
Applicant ultimately did. Applicant's moving and cost of living explanations for not addressing the delinquent debts earlier do not entitle Applicant to 
mitigation as an unanticipated condition. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The medical problem caused by Applicant's wife is a condition that warrants some consideration under FC MC 3. Applicant's car wreck and required purchase 
of a used car in October 2003 would provide Applicant with considerable additional consideration had he provided documentation of the monetary loss due to 
the accident and the cost of the used vehicle in October 2003. Additional concerns are raised about the credibility of the car wreck and purchase of the used 
vehicle in October 2003 because neither incident is mentioned in Applicant's interrogatory answers or his answer to the SOR. The limited application of FC 
C 1 and FC MC 3 is insufficient to overcome the adverse evidence under FC DC 1 and FC DC 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC DC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is 
under control</EM>) will generally apply where the evidence shows that financial counseling has aided an applicant in restoring order to his or her  financial 
obligations. The condition does not apply as there is no evidence of official or unofficial counseling. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.5. (<EM>the affluence resulted from a legal 
source</EM>) is not applicable to these facts. FC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) 
applies in mitigation because Applicant paid off the sixth creditor (listed in the SOR) on October 28, 2004. However , the mitigation is diluted by the time it 
took for Applicant to take his first documented step in repaying his creditors. The consolidation plan does not receive much weight because Applicant has made 
no payments under the plan. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case under the personal conduct guideline, the Government has presented insufficient evidence, 
especially Item 7 (CBR), to show Applicant deliberately falsified his answer to question 39 of the SCA. PC DC E2.A5.1.2.2. <EM>(the deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security questionnaire used to determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness.</EM>) There is no doubt the missing information is material in that it could affect the course of the investigation. However, the absence of sufficient 
evidence of deliberateness supports a finding in Applicant's favor under the PC guideline. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The findings against Applicant under the FC guideline and for him under the PC guideline remain unchanged after a full review of the evidence under the whole 
person concept. The unfulfilled promises by Applicant to settle or pay off his delinquent debts raise lingering security concerns that his financial problems will 
persist in the future.</SPAN></P>
