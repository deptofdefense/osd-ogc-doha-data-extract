<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, a form carpenter with a federal contractor, has a history of alcohol abuse, including numerous alcohol-related arrests that resulted in several convictions for DUI.  He self-admitted on three 
occasions for alcohol detoxification.  Despite being treated for alcohol dependence, he continues to consume alcohol.  He was discharged from the Army in 1972 for drug abuse.  He has been arrested 
approximately 22 times.  He falsified an answer on his security clearance application.  He successfully mitigated the security concern involving drugs, but failed to mitigate the security concerns about

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 6, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 
1992, as amended.  The SOR alleged facts under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline H (drug involvement), Guideline J (criminal conduct), and Guideline E (personal conduct) which 
precluded DOHA from making a  preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance.  DOHA 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On or about December 19, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations in the SOR, and requested a decision without a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in 
support of the government's case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on March 21, 2006.  In the FORM, the government moved  to amend SOR subparagraph 4.a. by substituting a new 
subparagraph 4.a. in lieu thereof.  Applicant offered no objection.  The government's motion is sustained.  Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation by April 20, 2006.  Applicant filed a response to the FORM which was received by DOHA on May 1, 2006.  The case was  assigned to me on May 31, 2006.</SPAN></P>

show he failed to appear in court, a warrant was issued, and he was subsequently arrested on November 11, 1999.  Upon his plea of guilty he was sentenced to seven days in jail. <A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> The government

individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information."<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A>  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as 
well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing use, handling, and protection of classified information."<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A>  Eligibility 
for a security clearance may be adjudicated using the  security guidelines contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating the security 
worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive: nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; 
frequency and recency of the conduct; age of the Applicant; motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, wilful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences involved; absence or presence of rehabilitation; and probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A>  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's 
security suitability.<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A>  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A>  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the 
government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who 
will protect the national interests as his or his own.  The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in 
favor of the government.<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A>  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, not actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security decisions shall be "in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, 
loyalty, and patriotism. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence as a whole,  I find the following guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline G: <EM>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information due to carelessness</EM></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline G. Applicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents and arrests.  The arrest records, the clinical evaluations, and Applicant's admissions  support 
most of the SOR allegations. The following Guideline G Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) apply: AC DC E2.A7.1.2.1. (<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as 
driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or their criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>) and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5. (<EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of 
impaired judgment</EM>.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted to DUI arrests in November 1973, March 1977, July 1977, February 1987, July 1987, and April 1988.  He was arrested in December 1973 for public intoxication.  He admitted to 
receiving treatment at VA hospitals in August 1986, September 1988, and March 1999, for alcohol detoxification.  From June 2001 to December 2001, he was treated at a VA hospital, in part, for 
alcohol dependence.  He admitted relapsing in May and August 2002.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant stated he hasn't had any drinking problems since 2003.  He continues to drink as many as six beers per week.  Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC). E2.A7.1.3.2. <EM>(The 
problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem) </EM>and AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3. <EM>(Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety) </EM>do not apply in light of 
Applicant's record.  He has a 30 year pattern of alcohol abuse and he continues to drink notwithstanding four treatments for alcohol problems, and in the face of an alcohol dependence diagnosis.  
Because of the extent of his conduct, sufficient time has not elapsed to conclude these mitigating factors are applicable.  He has not provided proof of successful rehabilitation to include being alcohol-free for 12 months, proof of consistent attendance at AA or similar meetings, and receipt of a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  No other mitigating conditions apply.  I  conclude Guideline G against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline H.  Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM>Any drug abuse</EM>)<A HREF="05-07079.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A> and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (<EM>Illegal drug possession, 
including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>)<EM> </EM>are applicable.  Applicant admitted he was discharged from the United States Army for drug abuse.  He denied his April 
1998 arrest for possession of controlled substances paraphernalia.  However, his arrest and subsequent failure to appear in court are found in the FBI identification records and sheriffs' arrest and 
booking reports.  SOR subparagraph 2.c. alleges Applicant's use of crack cocaine.  The record is devoid of any evidence to support the allegation and I find the government did not establish its case on 
this point. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #ff0000"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition (DI MC)  E2.A8.1.3.1. (<EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>) applies.  There are two events, 25 years apart, and nothing further in the last eight years.  The 
latter fact makes DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3. (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>) applicable.  Possession of drug paraphernalia is not proof of drug usage.  Since there is no evidence of 
drug usage since 1973, I conclude Guideline H for Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct </STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline J.  Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. <EM>(Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged) </EM>applies.  Applicant admitted 15 arrests between 1971 and 1995, three Article 15 while in the Army, and the four arrests he denied appearing in the FBI records and 
sheriff's arrest records.  This pattern of offenses makes applicable CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>.)  Additionally, there is one violation under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001 
for making a false answer on a security clearance application.  There was no evidence of crack cocaine use by Applicant and the other two allegations under Title 18 fail because Applicant's answers 
were truthful to the two answers to Question 27.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) E2.A6.1.3.1.  <EM>(The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>), CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2. (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident</EM>), and CC MC E2.A6.1.3.6. (<EM>There 
is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>) do not apply.  While his last arrest was in 1998, he has over 20 arrests, they are not isolated or coerced, and there is no evidence of rehabilitation.  One of 
his false answers on his security clearance application occurred in 2005, so there is a continuing pattern of criminal activity for 35 years.  I conclude Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established its case under Guideline E.  Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2. (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and 
material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) applies.  In his answer to the SOR Applicant stated, "I did not list my arrests or alcohol treatment on the 
security paperwork because I thought it would keep me from getting a job."  He listed one DUI arrest in 1990.  He stated that he was not good at remembering dates of arrests.  With over 20 arrests, his 
answer that he could only remember one is not credible.  He served a year in jail after one arrest.  His willingness to ignore the truth for his own benefit and his failure to acknowledge his previous 
falsification by denying them in his answer renders him untrustworthy and a security risk.  Applicant's conduct further demonstrates unreliability and questionable judgment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">But, the allegations of making false statements  contained in SOR subparagraphs 4.b. and 4.c. are predicated on the use of crack cocaine as alleged in subparagraph 2.c.  Having concluded that there is 
no evidence supporting Applicant's use of crack cocaine, the government has not established its case for SOR subparagraphs 4.b. and 4.c.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the mitigating conditions apply.  He did not voluntarily correct the false information previously provided, there is no evidence that he received improper or inadequate information, and he 
admitted lying on his security clearance application to enhance his chances at getting a job.  There are no reasons to apply any of the mitigating conditions.  I conclude Guideline E against Applicant.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions listed under each applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person 
concept, and have made a fair and commonsense assessment of the record.  This record  raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified information and to exercise 
the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's 
security clearance.</SPAN></P>
