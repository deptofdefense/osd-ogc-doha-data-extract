<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,  as amended by
Change 3, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated April 10, 1997, to the Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	On April 29, 1997,  Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested
that his case be determined on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government submitted
its File of Relevant Material on May 31, 1997, a copy of which was forwarded to Applicant with
instructions to submit material in explanation, extenuation or mitigation within thirty days of receipt. 
Applicant elected not to file a response and the case was assigned for resolution to a DOHA
Administrative Judge on July 21, 1997.  On August 7, 1997, the case was transferred to the
undersigned due to workload considerations.</P>

<P>          </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	After a thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
this Administrative Judge renders the following findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 32 year old sales manager who has worked for his current employer, a defense
contractor, since December 1995.  He seeks a security clearance for his duties there.</P>

<P>	Applicant was born in foreign country A to a United States citizen on January 9, 1965.  By
virtue of his birth abroad to a United States national, Applicant possesses both foreign country A and
United States citizenship.</P>

<P>	Adopted by two resident citizens of foreign country A,<A HREF="97-0172.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> Applicant was raised and schooled
there.  From September 1978 to September 1983, Applicant studied economics and mathematics at
an educational institution in foreign country A.  From 1984 to 1988, Applicant served on active duty
as an officer in a branch of foreign country A's military. </P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></P>

<P>	In January 1989, Applicant commenced employment in foreign country A as a regional sales
manager with an international defense industry research and publishing firm.  In March 1990, he was
transferred to that firm's offices in the United States.  He remained employed by that concern until
June 1994 when he started a position with another publishing firm.</P>

<P>	As a dual citizen of the United States and foreign country A, Applicant is entitled to vote in
foreign country A elections.  Resident continuously in the United States from March 1990, Applicant
since his relocation has not exercised any voting right and/or privilege other than that afforded him
as a United States citizen.  On November 20, 1993, Applicant married  a United States citizen.  He
intends to remain in the United States because of his employment here and marriage to a United
States citizen.</P>

<P>	Circa March 1984 to at least April 1997, Applicant possessed a foreign country A passport. 
Applicant obtained his United States passport on or about January 12, 1988.  Over the December
1991 to September 1995 time frame, Applicant made nine separate trips to foreign country A.   He
used his foreign country A passport to enter the country in preference to his United States passport
"for convenience."  Applicant used his United States passport for all other travel.<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></P>

<P>	Applicant does not anticipate any financial benefits or privileges from the foreign country
A government and has not registered with foreign country A's embassy to obtain benefits.  He has
never traveled to foreign country A for purposes of fulfilling any citizenship requirements and does
not maintain his dual citizenship to protect financial interests, property ownership, or employment
or inheritance rights in foreign country A.  Applicant has some money invested in a bank in foreign
country A which he inherited on the death of his adoptive father.  As of January 3, 1997, Applicant
was contemplating the purchase of property in foreign country A as a joint investment with his sister
who continues to reside in that nation.</P>

<P>	Applicant has been forthcoming about his dual citizenship status with the Department of
Defense.  In conjunction with his personnel security background investigation, Applicant was
interviewed by a Special Agent of the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) on January 3, 1997.  
Applicant advised the Agent that he holds allegiance to both the United States and foreign country
A.  He indicated he would not use a position of trust with the United States Government to serve the
interests of foreign country A in preference to those of the United States.  Applicant also denied any
further obligation to the foreign country A ministry of defense, but volunteered that he would serve
in foreign country A's military again, if required.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in
making the overall common sense determination  required.  Each adjudicative decision must also
include an assessment of the seriousness, recency, frequency and motivation for an applicant's
conduct; the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with
knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; the age of the applicant; the absence or
presence of rehabilitation, the potential for coercion or duress, and the probability that the conduct
will or will not recur in the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section F.3. and Enclosure 2.  Because
each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the
factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. 
oreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a
recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable
behavior. </P>
</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	 Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following
adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1">FOREIGN PREFERENCE</P>

<P><STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over
the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that
are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P>

<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>	(1) the exercise of dual citizenship</P>

<P>	(2) possession and/or use of a foreign passport</P>

<P>	(3) military service or willingness to bear arms for a foreign country</P>

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">* * *</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, a decision to grant or
continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is
clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense
determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions
which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact,
the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions
under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant
may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Burden of Proof<STRONG></U></CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as
a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present
evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence
of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against the Applicant.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	A dual citizen of foreign country A and the United States from birth, Applicant's foreign
citizenship would be of little security significance if it was based solely on his birth on foreign soil. 
In order for conduct to be cognizable under criterion C, foreign preference, the individual must have
<EM>acted</EM> in such a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States.  Having
considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, this Judge
concludes that the Government has established its case with regard to criterion C.</P>

<P>	<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>Raised and educated in foreign country A by an adoptive family of country A origin and
orientation, Applicant served four years as an infantry officer in country A's military from 1984 to
1988 and he remained in country A to pursue a civilian career in sales management.   <FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>By all
accounts, he was only nominally a United States citizen. There is no evidence Applicant had any
personal experience with the United States during his formative years or any close relatives in this
country.   Apart from pr<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>ocuring his United States passport on January 12, 1988, there is no evidence
that Applicant exercised any right and/or privilege of his United States citizenship prior to the
transfer of his job situs to offices in the United States in March 1990.  After accepting a benefit of
United States citizenship (the passport), Applicant not only continued to maintain a valid country
A passport, but on his trips to country A thereafter, Applicant presented his foreign passport in
preference to his United States passport "for convenience."  <FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>Inimical intent or detrimental impact
on the interests of the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access
under criterion C.  The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that those entrusted with
this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which one is also
a citizen in cases of dual citizenship.</P>

<P>	In determining the current security significance of Applicant's exercise of  rights or
privileges afforded him as a citizen of foreign country A, this Administrative Judge must consider
the Adjudicative Guidelines pertaining to foreign preference set forth in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. 
 Of the nine listed potentially security disqualifying conditions (DC), Applicant's conduct falls with
in DCs 1. (exercise of dual citizenship), 2. (possession and or/use of a foreign passport) and 3.
(military service or willingness to bear arms for a foreign country). <FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>Although Applicant had
apparently received an inheritance on the death of his adoptive father, there is no evidence that he
was continuing to maintain dual citizenship to protect a financial interest in foreign country A.</P>

<P>	Foreign preference concerns are mitigated under the Directive if the dual citizenship is based
solely on birth (MC 1.),<A HREF="97-0172.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> the indicators of possible foreign preference occurred before obtaining
United States citizenship (MC 2.), the activity is sanctioned by the United States (MC 3.) or the
individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship (MC 4.).  In Applicant's case,
it is his United States citizenship which was based solely on birth.  MC 1. does not apply to
Applicant's foreign country A citizenship.  MC 2. is clearly not apposite where he has held United
States citizenship from birth.  Moreover, there is no evidence that his foreign military service or his
use  of his country A passport were sanctioned by the United States.   <FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>Prior to his employment
transfer to the United States,  his actions were for the most part consistent with the exercise only of
his foreign country A citizenship.<A HREF="97-0172.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	Having dervied economic and political benefits from his foreign country A citizenship for
twenty-five of his thirty-two years,  he has only recently sought to exercise the rights and privileges
attendant with his United States citizenship.  To his credit, he has not voted by proxy in foreign 
country A elections since becoming resident in the United States but has voted in United States
elections.  While he has also established residence in the United States, married a United States
national and indicated an intent to remain here, his presentation of his country A passport when
visiting that nation since is an act of foreign preference.  As recently as April 29, 1997, Applicant
expressed allegiance to country A as well as to the United States and a willingness to again serve in
foreign country A's military, if required.  As his continued use of his foreign country A passport and
his willingness to serve in the foreign military demonstrate, Applicant has no intent to renounce his
country A citizenship.  As of January 3, 1997, he was contemplating purchasing property in country
A with his sister, a resident national of foreign country A.   While Applicant has a legal right to
maintain his dual citizenship with its attendant benefits as well as responsibilities, it has not been
demonstated that he can be counted on to always act in preference to the United States.  He continues
to bear allegiance to foreign country A and has both financial and family ties there.  There exists an
unacceptable risk that his future decisions will be influenced by concerns for foreign country A,
whose interests may or may not be completely consistent with those of the United States. 
Accordingly, subparagraphs<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT> 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. are resolved against him.<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>The Government's position is that mitigating condition 1 (dual citizenship based solely on birth) is available
for Applicant.  This Administrative Judge does not share such an expansive reading of MC 1, but instead interprets that
