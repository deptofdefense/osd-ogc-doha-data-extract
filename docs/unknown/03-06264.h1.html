<P>Applicant is a self-employed food service consultant for a defense contractor.  She has delinquent debts, including for federal and state taxes, she has not 
satisfied.  Applicant did not file federal tax returns for two years which is a criminal offense under a federal statute.  Applicant deliberately did not provide 
correct answers to questions on her security clearance application concerning debts past due over 180 days in the last seven years and currently past due over 90 
days.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 8, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a 
security clearance for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(February 20, 1990), 
as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (January 2, 1992), 
as amended and modified (Directive).  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 12, 2004.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 26, 2004, and November 24, 2004.  She admitted to all of the allegations, except for denying part of one 
allegation under Guideline F, and denied the allegations under Guidelines E and J.  Her request for a hearing before an administrative judge was received by 
DOHA on November 26, 2004.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on January 27, 2005, and the case was assigned to me on February 
1, 2005.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 22, 2005, for a hearing on March 21, 2005.  Applicant requested a delay of the hearing and the hearing 
convened on March 29, 2005.  Six government exhibits, one Applicant exhibit, and the testimony of the Applicant were received during the hearing.  The 
record was held open for Applicant to submitted additional documentary information, but she did not submit additional information.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The transcript was 
received on April 8, 2005.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 39-year-old self-employed food service consultation.  She receives assignments from a defense contractor to consult on food service.  She is 
employed full-time as a contracts manager for another company that is not a defense contractor.  A security clearance is required for the food service consulting 
business.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has delinquent debts dating from 1996.  Debt 1.a. in the SOR is for a 1996 trash collection bill.  Applicant stated the debt was paid and she would 
provide documentary information of the payment.  Debt 1.b. in the SOR is a 1997 credit card bill applicant stated she was paying and would provide 
documentary information of the payments.  Applicant did not provide documentary information to confirm she is making payments on these debts.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.c. in the SOR is a 1997 city personal property tax bill for $11,708 for a car.  Applicant alleges she owes the city only $2,219 since the vehicle was not 
located in the city for the entire time the tax was assessed and that she made payments on the tax.  Applicant agreed but did not provide documentary 
information of the reduced tax and payments made to the city.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.d. in the SOR is taxes owed the Internal Revenue Service for tax year 1997<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>.  Debt 1.e. in the SOR is taxes owed State A for tax year 1997.  This tax was 
payed by tax refund offset in a later tax year.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Debt 1.f. in the SOR is taxes owed State B for tax year 1997.   Both State A and State B placed a tax lien against 
Applicant for 1997 taxes.  Applicant stated she has payment arrangements with the Internal Revenue Service and State B but provide no documentary 
information of an arrangement.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.g. in the SOR is a 1998 telephone bill Applicant stated was paid.  Applicant did not provide any documentary information the bill was paid.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.h. in the SOR is an Internal Revenue tax bill for tax year 1998.  Debt 1.i. in the SOR is a State B tax bill for tax year 1998.  State B placed a tax lien 
against Applicant for the 1998 taxes.  Applicant stated she is making payments on these tax debts but provided not documents to support her claim.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.j. in the SOR is for payment of equipment leased by Applicant in 1999.  Debt 1.k. in the SOR is for the rent of an apartment in 1999.  Applicant stated 
she has attempted to make arrangements with the creditors on these two debts but was unsuccessful.  Applicant provided no documentary information on her 
attempts to make arrangements with the creditors.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Debt 1.l. in the SOR is taxes owed State B for tax year 2000.  Applicant states she has arrangement with the state to pay the tax arrears but provided no 
documentary information of the arrangements.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not file federal income tax returns for tax years 1999 and 2000.  A willful failure to file federal tax returns violates 26 United States Code, 
Section 7203.  Applicant stated she did not willfully fail to file the tax returns but had extra money taken from her paycheck to cover her federal and state taxes.  
Applicant did not provide documentary evidence of the money taken from her pay or the federal tax returns for 1999 and 2000 that she did eventually file.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant completed a security clearance application in March 2002.  In response to question 36 asking if there were any tax liens in the last seven years, 
Applicant listed a tax lien for State A but not the two tax liens for State B.  Applicant stated she did not know there were tax liens from State B because she had 
moved and she did not receive the notices.  Additional state taxes for State B were being withheld from her pay so she did not believe State B would initiate a 
tax lien.  Applicant provided not documentary information of the amount of taxes for State B withheld from her pay.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On her March 2002 security clearance application, Applicant listed one debt in response to question 38 asking in the last seven years if there had been debts 
delinquent over 180 days, and answered "no" to question 39 asking if there were any debts currently over 90 days delinquent.  In fact, there were numerous 
debts in the last seven years delinquent over 180 days and a number of debts currently over 90 days delinquent.  She stated she accidently answered the 
questions incorrectly.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security clearances.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines 
for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each 
clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, 
and the factors listed in the Directive &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable information about

voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree

necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN>  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible 
for access to classified information.<A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Thereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-06264.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN>  An applicant

<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</P> 
 
<P>Guideline F - Financial Considerations: A security concern exists for an individual who is financially irresponsible.  An individual who is financially 
irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in 
one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline J - Criminal Conduct: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</P> 
 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct: A security concern exists for conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty<EM>, </EM>or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information.</P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guidelines are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>I carefully considered all of the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the 
SOR.</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline F.  Applicant's delinquent debts dating from 1996 brings the matter within Financial Considerations 
Disqualifying Conditions Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>a history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to 
satisfy debts</EM>).  Applicant has been accumulating delinquent debt since 1996.  Some of these debts are for small amounts and some are large amounts, 
particularly for unpaid taxes.  Applicant has not satisfied her delinquent debts even though she says she will and claims she is trying to make arrangements with 
creditors.  Applicant's debts show a history of not meeting financial obligations and an unwillingness or inability to satisfy debts.  I conclude the above 
disqualifying conditions have been established.</P> 
 
<P>The only Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition that could apply to Applicant is Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>).  Applicant stated she either paid some of her delinquent debts, made arrangements to pay delinquent debts, 
or attempted unsuccessfully to make arrangements with creditors to pay debts.  Applicant did not produced any documents to verify her claims of satisfied debts 
or arrangements to satisfy debts.  The only document she provided shows a tax refund in a later year for State A applied to her past due taxes to State A.  The 
debt has been satisfied even if by forced application of a tax refund.  I conclude Applicant has not met her burden to establish that she initiated a good-faith 
effort to satisfy the remainder of her debts and mitigate allegations for financial considerations.</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline J.  Applicant's failure to file federal tax returns for tax years 1999 and 2000 in violation of a federal 
criminal statute brings the matter under Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.1 (<EM>allegations or admission of criminal conduct, 
regardless of whether the person was formally charged</EM>) ; and Directive &para; E2.A10 .1.2.2 (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>).  Applicant's failure 
to file federal income tax returns for two tax years is a federal criminal offense so the government has established the disqualifying condition.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant presented no information to mitigate the Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions.  The Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions to be considered 
for Applicant's case are Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>the criminal behavior was not recent); Directive &para; </EM>E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM>); and 
Directive &para; E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>).  The failure to file two years of federal tax returns four and five years ago is not 
recent and not isolated, but her failure to pay is recent.  Applicant claims she is paying the back taxes but provided no proof to back-up her claim.  She 
presented no documentary information tax returns have been filed and payment made on past due taxes.  There is no indication of successful rehabilitation from 
Applicant.  Applicant has not presented information to mitigate the security concern for criminal conduct.</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline E.  Applicant's failure to list all of the tax liens and all delinquent debts past due over 180 days in the 
last seven years and all current delinquent debts over 90 days brings the matter under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 (<EM>the 
deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness</EM>).  When Applicant listed on the security clearance 
application only a tax lien from State A, she had not received a notice of tax liens from State B because she had moved.  She also had extra withholding for 
State B's taxes taken from her pay.  It is reasonable to conclude Applicant did not know of the State B tax liens.  Her failure to list the tax liens from State B in 
response to question 36 was not a deliberate attempt to omit, conceal or falsify her response, and I find for her as to this allegation.  However, Applicant did 
know she had numerous delinquent debts over 180 days past due in the last seven years and currently had debts past due over 90 days.  Even though she did not 
know the exact debts and the amounts of indebtedness, she knew debts existed and she made no attempt to learn the facts before completing the security 
clearance application.  I conclude Applicant deliberately omitted, concealed or falsified her responses to questions 38 and 39.  Since Applicant did not provide 
correct information voluntarily or before being confronted with the facts, she did not established the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions under Directive &para; 
E2.A5.1.3 (<EM>the falsification was an isolated incident, not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</EM>); and Directive &para; 
E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>I carefully considered all of the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</P>
