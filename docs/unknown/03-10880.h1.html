<P>Applicant has a history of bankruptcy (discharged in 1997) followed by additionally incurred delinquent debts  between 1997 and 2000 during periods of 
intermittent unemployment and problems with his child support.  The listed debts exceed $14,000.00.  His delinquent debts despite remain significant amidst 
continued Applicant resistence to addressing his debts despite his reported ability to do so with the net monthly income available to him since at least February 
2003.   Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 12, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on May 3, 2004 and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on May 5, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing on June 
4, 2004.  A hearing was convened on August 24, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, 
continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness 
(himself) and 16 exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on September 1, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as follows: subparagraph 1.l to add the words after the words "in the 
approximate amount of $2,832.44:" Beginning with a new sentence,  "A default judgment was taken against Applicant by the creditor."  There being no 
objections from Applicant, and good cause being shown, Department Counsel's amendment motion was granted.  Applicant was permitted to answer 
subparagraph 1.l, which he admitted. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to permit him an opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of 
charging of an Applicant checking account, credit reports showing two listed accounts as one, payment of one of the listed accounts and the judgment regarding 
creditor 1.l.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven (7) days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn, was afforded five (5) days to 
respond.  Applicant failed to supplement the record within the time permitted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated delinquent debts, 12 in all on debts that total in excess of $14,000.00, and to petitioned for 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 1996, for which he was discharged in January 1997.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of his debts (<EM>i.e., </EM>those with listed creditors 1.d through 1.h and 1.l) while denying the others.  
Specifically, he denied any delinquent debts with creditors 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He admitted petitioning for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1997, for which 
he was discharged.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 44-year-old data monitor for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR, and admitted to by 
Applicant, are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his wife accumulated considerable consumer debts prior to their divorce in January 1996.  Under the terms of their divorce decree, Applicant was 
assigned responsibility for taking care of all of the joint marital debts incurred during the term of the marriage, and hold his wife harmless therefrom (<EM>see</EM> ex. C).  
Among those assumed debts was the loan on their family vehicle, which the wife was granted possession as a part of the couple's pre-trial stipulation (<EM>see</EM> exs. 2 
and C).  Applicant was also ordered to pay $360.00 a month in child support for his young daughter, for whom his wife was awarded custody (<EM>see</EM> ex. C).  The 
wife, though, was assigned responsibility for maintaining a policy of medical/hospitalization insurance for bearing responsibility for one-half of the uninsured 
medical, hospitalization, dental, prescription drug and physician's expenses reasonably incurred on behalf of their child.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Soon after his divorce had become final, Applicant began falling behind in paying the debts assigned to him to discharge under his divorce decree.  After 
struggling for a while to pay his debts,  he elected to petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy as a means to discharge his old debts (<EM>see</EM> exs. 2 and 6).  Applicant 
received his bankruptcy discharge in January 1997 (ex. 6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his bankruptcy discharge, Applicant persevered in working, paying his child support, and generally staying current with his debts and expenses.  
After he was terminated from his employer the first time (in July 1998), he found work with another company and made intermittently before being laid off the 
following year.  For the ensuing three months he was unemployed, he couldn't pay anything on either his debts or his child support (<EM>see</EM> exs. 1 and 2).  When he 
resumed work with the same employer in 1999, he made some payment progress with his creditors.  However,  he stopped making payments on his debts even 
before he was terminated by the same employer for the second time:  in April 2001 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1; R.T., at 154-55). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant joined a new employer in August 2001 but continued to avoid paying anything on his old debts or child support (even after returning  to work), 
despite a reported monthly remainder of $367.00 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2; R.T., at 165).  Since February 2003, he has been able to resolve his child support arrearage and 
secure financial relief from withholding on his child support (<EM>see</EM> ex. P; R.T., at 140-42), while gaining custody of his daughter in April 2004 (<EM>see</EM> ex. M).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Altogether, Applicant has accrued over $14,000.00 on 11 debts since his emergence from Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January 1997.  His debts include a 
substantial deficiency on a repossessed vehicle in June 2000, numerous medical debts, and assorted consumer debts he claims he either paid or endorsed 
receipted insurance checks over to his wife for payment to the covered medical providers  (R.T., at 130-35). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite past promises to address his creditors (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2), Applicant has continued to deny responsibility for most of his debts (attributing them to his ex-spouse) and failed to follow through on writing to his creditors or seeking or resolving them through debt consolidation or a second bankruptcy.  While 
claiming multiple assignments of his debts to unscrupulous collection agencies and past disputes over his debts with the creditors, he has made no effort to 
inform credit reporting agencies of his debt disputes (R.T., at 145-46).  To date, Applicant has failed and refused to make any payments or initiate any written 
inquiries to any of the listed creditors in the SOR, or provide any documentation of debt reconciliation with any of his listed creditors, despite an increased 
monthly remainder (raised to $517.00 in November 2003) and  presented opportunities to do so (R.T., at 147-66).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant contacted a credit counseling service to explore debt consolidation, he has  not followed up on his initial inquiry and for lack of any available 
loan resources has not signed up with any debt consolidation service to date (R.T., at 163-64).  He insists he does not have a $517.00 monthly remainder every 
month, as reported, but provides no monthly bank statements or revised documentation of any kind to corroborate his claims.  Without more in the record to 
back his limited resource claims, his reported $517.00 net monthly remainder must be accepted as generally available to him, at least for the relevant period 
spanning November 2003 and August 2004 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3; R.T., at 165-66).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant lives frugally and spends most of his available resources on his current obligations and caring for his daughter and adopted child.  He is considered 
dependable and responsible by his immediate supervisor (ex. L) and was honorably discharged from his military service in May 1997 (<EM>see </EM>ex. O).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 1.  The behavior was not recent.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant accrued considerable delinquent debt between 1997 and 2000 following his divorce and emergence from bankruptcy, which he has only minimally 
addressed despite promises made to identify and pay his debts in a 2003 DSS interview.  Applicant's listed delinquent debts (12 in all) include an entered 
judgment in behalf of one of his major creditors and total over $14,000.00, which have for the most part been charged off with no manifest intention to address 
or follow up on within the past six years.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on Applicant's considerable accumulation of delinquent debt, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for Guideline F 
apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).  While his accrued debts are accompanied by 
some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>short periods of unemployment), for the most part his finances have permitted modest attempts to pay on his old creditors 
with the resources available to him since at least February 2003. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are neither extenuated nor mitigated enough to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His periodic 
unemployment experiences, while problematic, were relatively short in duration and do not appear to have inhibited his ability to address his debts after he 
returned to full time employment.  Significant delinquent debt attributable to an applicant that is neither extenuated nor mitigated by good-faith resolution raises 
implicit security risks over the potential for needed funds and recurrent judgment lapses.  The government does not have to wait until an individual mishandles 
or fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable security clearance decision.  <EM>Cf. Adams v. Laird, </EM>420 F.2d 230, 238-39 (DC Cir. 
19969),<EM> cert. denied, </EM>397 U.S. 1039 (1970). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In Applicant's case, neither extenuation nor mitigation is demonstrated sufficiently to enable him to invoke either MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's 
control) or MC 6 (initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) of the Guideline, based on either his financial circumstances in 1997 to 1999, or his 
repayment efforts after he had returned to full-time employment. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Where (as here) there is insufficient evidence of repayment efforts after the conditions that contributed to an applicant's delinquent debts have passed, the 
Appeal Board has cautioned against crediting the applicant with either non-recent financial difficulties (MC 1 of the Guidelines) or excusing him from 
addressing his delinquent debts (even those accrued because of extenuating circumstances).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (September 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's 1997 bankruptcy (<EM>see</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-21045 (December 2004) and accumulated debts 
following his bankruptcy discharge, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his debts in the past, and his repeated intentions to avoid repaying his 
delinquent debts, Applicant fails to mitigate the Government's security concerns at this time.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant, accordingly, with respect to 
subparagraphs 1.a through 1.m of the allegations governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E: 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
