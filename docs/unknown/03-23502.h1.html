<P>Applicant has a nine year history of financial problems that has not been mitigated. She claims she paid about $7,000.00 in restitution to creditors in the last two 
years, but she provided documentation showing payment of $283.00 to only seven creditors. Though a second recent Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge allows her 
a chance to establish sound financial habits, the discharge does not have the same positive, probative value as a sustained record of financial responsibility. 
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 3, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, amended April 4, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant furnished her answer to the SOR on February 12, 2005. Applicant elected to have her case decided on a written record. The Government provided 
Applicant a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September 20, 2005. Applicant received the FORM on October 5, 2005. Her response to the 
FORM was due by November 6, 2005. No response was received. The case was assigned to me on December 6, 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 24, 2005, the Government moved to amend the SOR by adding the following allegation: "1.ff: You petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on about 
February 3, 2005 in the United States Bankruptcy Court, District of Arizona. Your dischargeable debts were discharged on or about July 2005." Pursuant to 
E3.1.17. of the Directive, allowing the Administrative Judge to amend the SOR so it conforms with evidence presented. See, GE 3, pp. 1, 6-16, GE 8, p. 1., the 
Government's Motion is granted. I interpret Applicant's Chapter 7 petition documentation listing the unsecured claims as her admission to subparagraph 1.ff.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges financial considerations under Guideline F. Applicant denied subparagraph 1.u., claiming she had paid the debt. She also denied subparagraph 
1.z., claiming this is the same debt as alleged in subparagraph 1.r. Applicant also denied 1.aa. Applicant admitted the remaining debts. In a supplemental 
statement to her answer, Applicant claimed she paid $7,000.00 in payments to collection agencies on her delinquent accounts, but these payments have not been 
acknowledged by DOHA. Because her payments have not been favorably considered, she decided to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy (subparagraph 1.ff.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 39 years old and employed as an engineer technician I by a defense contractor. She seeks a secret level clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided no reasons for her first bankruptcy (subparagraph 1.a.) in 1996 except to say she joined her former husband's Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition 
in September 1996; on January 29, 1997, $15,000.00 in delinquent debts were discharged. Her former husband<A HREF="03-23502.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> has since permanently moved to a foreign 
country.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR lists 28 delinquent debts. The debts include medical debts, insufficient fund checks and utility accounts. Subparagraphs 1.cc. And 1.dd. reflect a total 
of $24,000.00 in balances owed after resale of two of her automobiles that had been repossessed. The total past due amount listed in the SOR is $34,746.00. 
The utility bill identified in subparagraph 1.b. was charged off as a bad debt in February 1998.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As a part of the security investigation, Applicant was given an opportunity (sworn statement, GE 5) on May 13, 2003 to provide details regarding some of the 
past due debts that are listed in the SOR. Applicant identified some creditors but was unable to recognize others. Applicant voluntarily returned a car 
(subparagraph 1.cc.) to the dealer because the family moved to the southwestern part of the United States for health reasons. Additionally, her husband thought 
the dealer breached the contract as they had promised not to require payments until 45 days after the purchase. Instead, they required payments 15 days after the 
purchase. Applicant claims she intended to establish a payment plan to the 1.cc. and 1.dd. creditors when she had the money. Applicant indicated an intention to 
pay the smaller bills by June 2003. Applicant's sworn statement (May 13, 2003) concludes with a personal financial statement (PFS) showing she was current 
on two creditors and had a monthly net remainder of $3,385.00 </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Interrogatories (GE 9) regarding her delinquent debts were mailed to Applicant on May 5, 2004. The interrogatories identify some of the creditors listed in the 
SOR and request information about payment activity as well as other documentation that shows steps taken to resolve the debts. Applicant provided an 
explanatory statement to her answers indicating she was paying consistently on some debts. She also had been out of work for three months due to a serious 
illness and two surgeries; she provided a letter from her employer's human resources department explaining she would be put on short term disability in July 
2003. The letter provides procedures and regulations governing her disability but does not provide specific information about her illness and impact on her 
delinquent debts. She also suggested that her employer be contacted for additional information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's response to the first creditors identified in the interrogatories (GE 9, subparagraph 1.u. of the SOR) is "The account has been turned over to a local 
Debt Collection Agency. Please see attached information re: consistent payments." After examining the enclosures (the enclosures are either dated April 19 and 
22, 2004), there are payment ledgers that show payments of $511.55 to an unidentified creditor, but I do not find documentary proof the 1.u. creditor was paid. 
In response to the interrogatory requesting information about the first repossessed car (GE 9, subparagraph 1.cc.), Applicant explained she tried to settle with 
the creditor, who agreed to settle for $11,000.00 in three payments. No additional information was provided. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In response to the insufficient funds checks (subparagraphs 1.aa. and 1bb.), Applicant stated the debts were turned over to the local collections service. She 
recommended review of enclosed forms supposedly showing proof of payment. The enclosed forms show Applicant was contacted on April 22, 2004 about 
certain debts, including 1.aa. and 1.bb. The only indicators showing the debts were paid is the handwritten letters "pd" next to the insufficient check accounts. 
There is no substantiating proof, e.g., a payment receipt, bank account statement, processed check, indicating the respective amounts had been withdrawn from 
Applicant's bank account. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Regarding Applicant's answers to the interrogatory questions (GE 9) describing the delinquent debts belonging to the collection agency and identified in 
subparagraphs 1.l., 1.m., 1.o., 1.q., 1.r., 1.s., and 1.t. of the SOR, Applicant provided a one page document indicating a balance of $665.00 owed after a payment 
of $283.00 on April 22, 2004. No additional information is provided.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed a second Chapter 7 petition on February 3, 2005, and most of the SOR debts, except for the past due debts identified in subparagraphs 1.c., 1.f., 
1.i., 1.j., and 1.k., were discharged in July 2005. There were 31 accounts discharged, and 16 of those were medical accounts. The total liability discharged was 
$109,250.00. </SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding 
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general factors of the whole 
person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's 
reliance on his own common sense. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) "[T]he 
Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security 
suitability." ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>See Egan</EM>, 481 U.S. at 531; <EM>see</EM> Directive E2.2.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An inability to pay bills in a timely fashion manifests poor judgment that may disqualify an applicant from security clearance access.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paying debts in a timely fashion demonstrates good judgment and sound financial responsibility. However, inept financial habits or occurrences beyond the 
individual's control can impede or completely prevent the timely payment of debts. An example of poor financial habits is becoming financially overextended 
or spending more money than the person's budget allows. When spending outpaces earnings, an individual soon cannot pay her bills on time, and then develops 
a delinquent debt history that falls within the scope of financial considerations (FC) disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1. (<EM>a history of not meeting 
financial obligations</EM>). Applicant's unexplained financial problems began before 1996, and led to a Chapter 7 discharge of $15,000.00 in January 1997. Though 
Applicant stated an intention in May 2003 to pay her debts, and stated she had a net remainder of more than $3,385.00 every month after payment of her 
expenses, there is no documentation of any action taken until May 2004 when Applicant supplied some payment accounts dated April 19 and 22, 2004, that she 
had paid about $794.00 on her overdue debt to some creditors while trying to settle with other creditors. The SOR reveals that as of December 2004, Applicant 
still had a history of not meeting financial obligations leading to the filing of Applicant's Chapter 7 petition in February 2005. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's failure to take any documented action to pay off some of the debts by June 2003 as she had promised invokes FC DC E2.A6.1.2.3. (<EM>inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) since there was a promise to pay without subsequent action to make good on that promise. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The FC guideline lists six mitigating conditions (MC) that may apply to mitigate the negative information under FC. Neither FC MC E2.A61.3.1. (<EM>the behavior 
was not recent</EM>) nor FC MC E2.A6.1.3.2. (<EM>it was an isolated incident</EM>) applies to the circumstances of this case as Applicant's conduct was both recent and not 
isolated. In February 2005, she still owed at least $34,746.00 to 26 listed creditors. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's reference to a divorce and a three month illness in July 2003 activates FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. (<EM>the conditions that resulted in the behavior were 
largely beyond the person's control</EM>) because a divorce or medical problems are two conditions that can interfere with a person's bill-paying ability. The divorce 
has little relevance to Applicant's current financial problems because it occurred nine years ago. Applicant's three month illness, involving two surgeries, 
undoubtedly hampered her ability to pay her bills, and is substantiated by the fact the medical debts amounted to approximately 1/3 of the debt she discharged 
in bankruptcy in February 2005. Yet, Applicant was only disabled for three months. The only documentation provided by Applicant indicating payment to 
creditors is the $794.00 to some creditors ($511.00 to unidentified creditors) in April 2004, far short of the $7,000.00 claim she made in her answer to the SOR. 
The mitigation Applicant receives under FC MC E2.A6.1.3.3. is limited by the absence of more documentary evidence to support her claim of having paid 
almost $7,000.00 to creditors. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MC E2.A6.1.3.4. (<EM>the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control</EM>) is inapplicable because Applicant has received no counseling and there is no indication the problem is under control. Though Applicant has 
provided information indicating she is not using credit cards and she is writing fewer checks, these declarations do not convince me she has her financial house 
in order. The fact that she has had most of her debts discharged a second time under Chapter 7 in July 2005 provides compelling evidence of ongoing financial 
problems that have not been resolved. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MCE2.A6.1.3.6. (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) is applicable when the record shows an 
ongoing commitment to pay overdue creditors. The law recognizes that an applicant may resolve her delinquent problems through a Chapter 7 discharge. 
However, even though the discharge entitles her to a fresh start in handling her finances, the discharge also means her unsecured creditors do not get repaid. In 
addition, Applicant's nine year period of financial difficulties requires a sustained demonstration of financial responsibility before considering a favorable 
change has been made in her financial habits. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having weighed all the evidence, I find against Applicant under the FC guideline and the whole person concept. Given her 1997 bankruptcy discharge followed 
by subsequent financial problems leading to a second Chapter 7 discharge in February 2005, and the lack of evidence showing a dramatic change in her 
financial habits, her financial problems are likely to recur. Subparagraphs 1.l., 1.m., 1.q., and 1.r. are found in Applicant's favor based on the documented 
payment of $283.00 made to the collection agency. The remaining subparagraphs are found against Applicant. </SPAN></P>
