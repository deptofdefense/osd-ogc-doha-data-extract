<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	On 17 September 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary
affirmative finding<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant. On 2 October 1996, Applicant answered the SOR and requested
a hearing. The case was assigned to me on 23 October 1996; I received the case on 24 October
1996, set it the same day, and issued a Notice of Hearing on 15 November 1996 for a hearing 3
December 1996.</P>

<P>	At the hearing, the Government presented eight exhibits--six admitted without objection,
two over objection--and no witnesses; Applicant presented seven exhibits--two admitted
without objection, five over objection--and one witness, himself. I received the transcript on 12
December 1996.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and incorporated by reference.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR, except for the portion of
subparagraphs 1.h. and i. alleging that he received "treatment" for alcohol abuse; accordingly, I
incorporate Applicant's admissions as findings of fact. He did, however, deny the conclusory
allegations that he presently has an alcohol problem.</P>

<P>	Applicant--a 25-year old employee of a defense contractor--seeks a secret clearance.</P>

<P>	The allegations of the SOR revolve around Applicant's alcohol abuse. Applicant first
drank alcohol in December 1988 (age 17) when he drank with some friends on a ski trip. During
the rest of high school, Applicant drank seldom, never apparently to excess. In August 1989,
Applicant entered college, and began to drink more frequently, sometimes to excess. Applicant's
alcohol use caused him to become involved with the authorities on five occasions between 1991
and 1994.</P>

<P>	On 28 June 1991, Applicant (age 20) and some friends went to a police station to try to
extricate a friend who had been arrested for DWI.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Based on Applicant's appearance, the police
suspected that Applicant was intoxicated and asked him to identify himself; Applicant refused
and was arrested for underage drinking and possession of an altered license.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> He was transported
to a detoxification center, where he was found to have a blood alcohol level of .13%; he was
released the same day. He later paid a fine on a lesser drinking charge (the license charge was
dismissed).</P>

<P>	On 9 August 1991, Applicant (age 20) was cited for underage drinking and having a loud
party. Officers called to the scene observed that Applicant appeared to have consumed a
substantial amount of alcohol, but no blood alcohol content was taken.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> Applicant later paid
small fines on the two citations.</P>

<P>	On 19 August 1993, Applicant (age 22) took some beer to a party at a friend's house; one
of Applicant's underage friends had a beer, and Applicant was cited for supplying alcohol to a
minor.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A>  Neither Applicant nor the minor were intoxicated at the time. Imposition of sentence
was stayed, although Applicant paid court costs.</P>

<P>	On 29 May 1994, Applicant (age 23)--as driver of the car--was cited for having an open
bottle of alcohol in his car. Applicant was with some friends on a camping trip, and was not
aware that the friends had opened the bottles. Applicant paid a fine by mail.</P>

<P>	On 22 September 1994, Applicant (age 23) had been drinking with some friends at
Applicant's apartment when they decided to go to the friend's dorm, located on a "dry" campus.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A>
They took alcoholic beverages with them, and were spotted by campus police; Applicant and his
friends tried to persuade the campus police to just make them leave the campus, but were
unsuccessful. The police confiscated the alcohol, and took Applicant to a detoxification center,
where his blood alcohol level was found to be .09%.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A></P>

<P>	In August 1995, Applicant went to work for his present employer; his present supervisor
considers Applicant to demonstrate the highest work performance and expresses no doubts about
his abilities or judgment. Nevertheless, the supervisor does not appear to be aware of Applicant's
alcohol abuse history. Since going to work for his employer, Applicant has cut back in his
drinking; he estimates that he drinks twice a month, consuming 3-4 beers, and never drinks to the
point of intoxication. He acknowledges that in the past, he drove a car after drinking enough that
he should not have been driving.</P>

<P>	On 26 November 1996, Applicant had a chemical dependency evaluation which did not
substantiate a diagnosis of alcoholism.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in
evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account
the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and
circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in
Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a
particular condition for or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as
the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </P>

<P>	Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most
pertinent to this case:</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (CRITERION G)</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</P>

<P>	Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>		(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work. . .</P>

<P>		(3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse. . .</P>

<P>    	Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>		(2) the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a
recent problem;</P>

<P>		(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</P>

<P>		</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.
If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish
her security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to
demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise
doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden
of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under criterion G; however, I find the Applicant's
alcohol abuse mitigated. Without minimizing the abuse demonstrated by Applicant's encounters with
authority, I note that these incidents are generally less serious than they appear at first glance and
are certainly less serious than the kind of alcohol-related incidents cited in the disqualifying factors.<A HREF="96-0588.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A>

<P>In June 1991, Applicant was intoxicated, but it seems clear from the police report that he was
arrested principally for his refusal to identify himself and not necessarily because of his underage
drinking; similarly, in August 1991 Applicant was merely cited, and not arrested, for his underage
drinking--although again Applicant was apparently intoxicated. In August 1993, Applicant certainly
demonstrated poor judgment by taking beer to a party where he knew minors would be present, but
this incident is not indicative of a drinking problem. Neither Applicant nor the minor were
intoxicated; furthermore, while not condoning the Applicant's conduct, I find the Government's
implication that the conduct was especially heinous because the Applicant was 22 and his friend 20
to be somewhat excessive on the facts of this case.</P>

<P>	Applicant's May 1994 citation for having an open bottle in his car does not support a
conclusion that Applicant had an alcohol abuse problem. Applicant was not aware that his friends
had opened the bottle and there is no indication--or allegation by the Government--that Applicant
was intoxicated or had been drinking at the time of the citation.</P>

<P>	Applicant was certainly intoxicated--legally or in fact--on 22 September 1994 when he and
his friends took beer to a dry campus, and Applicant certainly was an uncooperative patient for the
10 or so hours he was at the detoxification center. But these facts standing alone do not dictate the
conclusion that Applicant presently has an alcohol abuse problem or that he was in denial of his
alcohol abuse at the time. He demonstrated no symptoms of withdrawal, had a blood alcohol level
of zero 10 hours after admission, and appeared well--and pleasant--at discharge. Although he
refused to see a counselor for an alcohol abuse video, there is no indication in the records that he was
discharged against medical advice or otherwise refused to heed a recommendation for further
treatment.</P>

<P>	Applicant is a young man who while a still younger man did what many young men do: he
drank too young, he drank too often, and he drank too much. Applicant has acknowledged as much
in his answer and his testimony. That abuse of alcohol resulted in three incidents (June and August
1991, and September 1994). But there have been no incidents of abuse since September 1994.
Applicant got a job with a defense contractor in August 1995 and began the process of growing up.
He no longer drinks to excess, and seems unlikely on the record before me to return to the abuse of
his college days. Accordingly, I conclude criterion G. in Applicant's favor.</P>
