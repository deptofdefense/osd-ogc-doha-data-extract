<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">This 25 year old Applicant used Marijuana from 2000 until at least September 2005. He has stated that he stopped using Marijuana, and he will not use it in the future. However, he never informed 
the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Government</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> when he last used it. Because of the recency of his Marijuana usage, and because in his SCA (Security Clearance Application), dated September 22, 2005, he indicated that he

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 27,  2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended 
and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and 
determine whether clearance should be granted or denied.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a signed and sworn statement, dated May 18, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations (RSOR). He requested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 19, 2006, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM)  <A HREF="index.html#N_1_"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><SUP></SUP></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SUP></SUP></A>was provided to Applicant, and he was given the 
opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did submit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">October</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 10, 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-5),  which have been admitted without objection. Applicant offered one documentary evidence (Exhibit A) which 
has also been admitted without objection into the record. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> The SOR contains five allegations, 1.a. through 1.e., under Guideline H (Drug 
Involvement). Applicant denied 1.a., and he admitted all of the other SOR allegations. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the FORM, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">moved to amend allegation 1.e., to remove the language indicating that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> was entitled to a waiver in a meritorious case, because a waiver does not apply 
under 10 U.S.C. 986 (c)(2). There being proper grounds for the stated amendment and no objection raised by </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> to this proposed amendment, the amendment to allegation 1.e. is granted.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant's Answer to the SOR and the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the 
additional findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant is 25 years old. He is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because it states that he </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">has used illegal substances.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">1.a. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In his SCA, (Exhibit 4), dated September 22, 2005, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> stated that he has used </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Marijuana from May 2000 to the present, and he estimated that he used it 90 times.  In his RSOR, he 
averred that he decided not to use Marijuana in the future, but he never gave any indication when, if at all, he actually stopped using Marijuana </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit 3). Despite the fact that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Department Counsel</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> 
raised, in the FORM, the issue that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> had not indicated when he stopped using </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Marijuana, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> again failed to address this question in his response to the FORM </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">(Exhibit A)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">. 
Therefore, there is no way to know when </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> stopped using Marijuana. Even if the RSOR is to be taken as credible, all that can be ascertained is that on some date before May 18, 2006, 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> no longer used Marijuana. Based on the fact that at the time </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> completed his SCA, he planned to continue using Marijuana in the future, and that he may have used it as recently 
as May 17, 2006, it is far too soon to determine that he will not use Marijuana  in the future.  </SPAN></P>

</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Marijuana</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.  Since the evidence indicates that </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> is not using any illegal substance at this time, 10 U.S.C. 986 does not apply in this case.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given "binding" 
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically 
determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of 
the world, in making a reasoned decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following factors 
[General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with 
the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day. The 
Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor 
judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable and unfavorable, 
with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with 
the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative 
Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is 
speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order...shall be</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a security 
clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh 
the Government's<EM></EM> case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) </STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and 
use of Marijuana and Ecstacy and the purchase of  Ecstacy is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal 
substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A8.1.2.1.), <EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">any drug abuse</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">, and DC (E2.A8.1.2.2.), </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">illegal drug possession, including cultivation, 
processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">Because Applicant last used Marijuana in at least 2005 or possibly 2006, I can not conclude that Applicant's conduct comes within Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A8.1.3.1), the drug involvement 
was not recent. While MC (E2.A8.1.3.3.), Applicant's stated intention not to continue using Marijuana in the future, could be argued to apply, I find that it is too recent after his last usage to find 
that this MC is controlling. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs under Guideline H. Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence 
in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff">  <STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
