<P>Applicant is 32 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 2000. When he filled out his security clearance application he deliberately concealed his 
past criminal and drug history. When providing a sworn statement to the Defense Security Service's investigator he admitted to some of his past criminal 
conduct, but concealed other parts of his background. Applicant's explanations and testimony at his hearing was not credible. Applicant mitigated the security

conduct. Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>On May 2, 2005, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating they were unable to find that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged 
security concerns under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J (criminal conduct), Guideline H (drug involvement), and Guideline E, (personal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn statement, dated </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">June 3, 2005</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, and they are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, 
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 32 years old, married and has worked for a federal contractor since 2000. He started with the company as a janitor and has worked his way up to 
the position of material handler. He finished high school and has taken some college classes. On September 25, 2000, approximately a week after starting his 
job, he was provided a security clearance application.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant claimed he had no idea what the form was for even though the top of the form reads "security 
clearance application." He claims he was afraid to provide accurate information because he would have to divulge his past criminal and drug history, and he did 
not know what the information would be used for. He did not seek advice from the security manager. Rather he asked the advice of his father, a long time and 
now retired employee of the same company. Applicant claims his father told him to falsify information on the form and not put down his drug history.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
Applicant listened to his father and falsely answered "no" to Question 27 inquiring about past illegal drug activity.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Applicant had used marijuana, with varying 
frequency, from about 1993 to about September 2000. He had used cocaine, with varying frequency, from about 1998 to September 2000, and had he used 
methamphetamines, with varying frequency, from about 1996 to about September 2000. Applicant stated "I have used marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamines, 
although I did not list this on my security forms. I left this information off because I was afraid that it might be held against me." <A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>Applicant's father testified at 
the hearing and when questioned about his advice to his son, he was evasive and feigned not to understand very simple and basic questions about the incident, 
finally stating he could not recall if he told his son to lie.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> His testimony was not credible.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to intentionally lying about his drug use Applicant also intentionally and deliberately falsified his answers to questions 21,<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 24,<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> and 26,<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> answering 
"no" to each. Question 21 asked about prior felony charges or convictions. Applicant was charged with felony burglary on September 30, 1988, and felony 
larceny on about May 17, 1991. No information was provided regarding the disposition of the 1988 case. To the felony larceny charge, Applicant pled guilty to 
theft by control and was sentenced to 14 hours of community service. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 24 asked about Applicant's police record with regards to alcohol or drug offenses. Applicant failed to divulge he had been arrested on about October 
1992 and charged with minor in possession of alcohol. He pled guilty and paid a fine of $201. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Question 26 asked Applicant to list whether he had been arrested, charged or convicted of any offense in the last 7 years that had not already been listed. 
Applicant was arrested on about July 16, 1995, and charged with theft under $1,200 and disorderly conduct. He was found guilty to the disorderly conduct and 
failure to appear and was sentenced to one day in jail. He was arrested on about May 19, 1996, and charged with assault, disorderly conduct and weapons 
misconduct. He was found guilty of disorderly conduct and was placed on 12 months' unsupervised probation. Applicant was arrested on about December 5, 
1996, and charged with criminal trespass. He was found guilty and placed on twelve months unsupervised probation and fined. Applicant was again arrested on 
about July 19, 1998, and charged with disorderly conduct, simple assault, trespassing, and threaten/stalking. No information was provided regarding the 
disposition of these charges. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant made a sworn statement to a Defense Security Services (DSS) investigator on April 2, 2003, over two and one half years after he submitted his SCA 
in September 2000.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> He admitted to being arrested three times and stated "Other than the above three arrests, the only police involvement I have had is a 
speeding ticket that I got in [State A]."<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He went on to say "I have had no other arrests."<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Later during the same interview, when confronted by the investigator 
about his numerous other arrests, Applicant finally admitted to them.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claimed he was immature when he provided the false information, he could not remember his past arrests, he did not want to remember them, he 
probably did remember some, but thought they were not important, and with regard to his criminal conduct he was either not really involved in it or he 
minimized his involvement.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> He admitted he used poor judgment in providing false answers. He did so because he was embarrassed by his past, stress, 
carelessness, and stupidity.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> He also attributed his failures to his supervisors and management because they should have better informed him and given him 
better direction and perhaps he would not have made an error. Applicant attributes his criminal and drug problems to being easily susceptible to peer pressure. 
He claims he was also coerced, but provided no specifics. He no longer associates with those who influenced him in this way.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant provided character statements from co-workers, a supervisor, and tenants, who believe he is an exemplary employee, hard worker, has a good work 
ethic, and is a professional . He is believed to have a high level of cognitive and verbal skills and demonstrates them in his job.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Applicant's tenants attest to 
him being an excellent landlord. Applicant claims to be a changed man, who is now a responsible adult. He no longer uses drugs and does not intend to do so in 
the future, and although he does drink alcohol, he does so responsibly. He is now committed to being a good citizen.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant intentionally and deliberately falsified information on his sworn SCA. He intentionally and deliberately falsified information on his sworn statement 
made two years later to DSS. At his hearing, Applicant was evasive, lacked candor, was unbelievable, and consistently untruthful. He consistently blamed 
others for his past criminal conduct, and minimized or denied his involvement. Applicant had numerous explanations for his falsifications, none of which were 
believable. Applicant's false statements were felonies in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Included in the 
guidelines are disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. Considering the evidence as a whole, 
Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, Guideline H, pertaining to drug involvement, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective 
DC and MC, apply in this case. Additionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and 
material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness 
of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, 
and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence of 
rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. Although the presence or absence of a particular 
condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured 
against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of evidence.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">him.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior indicates 
an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline H-Drug Involvement is a security concern because improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness 
or ability to protect classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline E-Personal Conduct is a security concern when an individual's conduct involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations that could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government has established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case for disqualification under 
Guidelines J, H and E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1 <EM>(Allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the person was formally charged)</EM>, and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2 (<EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) </EM>both apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has a long history of arrests, charges and convictions, both felony and misdemeanor. Applicant intentionally falsified his SCA and later lied in his 
sworn statement to the DSS investigator. Applicant's falsifications were a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001, a felony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1 (<EM>The criminal 
behavior was not recent), </EM>CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2 (<EM>The crime was an isolated incident),</EM> CC MC E2.A10.1.3.3. <EM>(The person was pressured or coerced into 
committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in that person's life)</EM> CC MC E2.A10.1.3.4 <EM>(The person did not voluntarily commit the act and/or 
the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur), </EM>and CC MC E2.A10.1.3.6 (<EM>There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation),</EM> and conclude none 
apply. Although Applicant's last formal charge was in 1998, his falsification of his SCA and his statement to the DSS investigator are felonies, and therefore 
his criminal conduct is recent. Applicant has numerous arrests, charges and convictions and therefore his criminal activity was not an isolated event. Applicant 
claimed he was coerced, but provided no specifics or corroborating evidence to support his position. His actions, including his latest falsifications, were done 
voluntarily and, although he sought advice from his father, he made the decision how to answer all the questions on his SCA and chose to deliberately provide 
false information. Due to his recent falsifications I find there is not clear evidence of successful rehabilitation. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns 
under Guideline, J, criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1 (<EM>Any drug abuse<A HREF="04-04518.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>), </EM>applies.<EM> </EM>Applicant used marijuana, cocaine and 
methamphetamines, with varying frequency until September 2000. I considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Drug Involvement 
itigating Condition (DI MC) E2.A8.1.3.1 (<EM>The drug involvement was not recent); </EM>DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2 (<EM>The drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational 
event)</EM>, DI MC E2.A8.1.3.3 (<EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future). </EM>Applicant's last drug use drugs was in September 2000, a period of 
over five years, and therefore I find his drug use was not recent. Based on the extended period from 1993 to 2000, and the variety of drugs he used, I find his 
drug involvement was not an isolated or aberrational event. Because there is no evidence of recent drug use, and Applicant has expressed a commitment that he 
does not intend to use drugs in the future, I find DI MC E2.A8.1.3.1. and DI MC D2.A8.1.3.3 apply. Applicant has successfully mitigated Guideline H, drug 
involvement.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2A5.1.2.2 (<EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM> ), PC DC 
E2.A5.1.2.3 <EM>(Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination)</EM>, PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 (<EM>Personal 
conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if 
known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail),</EM> and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.5 (<EM>A 
pattern of dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency) </EM>apply in this 
case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant deliberately concealed relevant information on his SCA. Later he deliberately provided false and misleading statements to a DSS investigator. 
Applicant was embarrassed by the information and believed it would hurt his chances of obtaining a clearance. His conduct shows a consistent disregard for the 
truth and a pattern of dishonesty. All of the above personal conduct disqualifying conditions apply. His actions raise serious questions about Applicant's 
character, judgment, and honesty.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the mitigating conditions and especially considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC MC) E2.A5.1.3.2 (<EM>The falsification was 
an isolated incident, was not recent, and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily)</EM>, PC MC E2.A5.1.3.3 (<EM>The individual made 
prompt , good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts), </EM>PC MC E2.A5.1.3.4 (<EM>Omission of material facts was caused or 
significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information was promptly and fully 
provided), </EM>and PC MC E2.A5.1.3.5 (<EM>The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
duress). </EM>I conclude none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant's falsifications were not isolated, as evidenced by him first lying on his SCA, then later 
on his sworn statement to DSS, and also at his hearing. Applicant did not make a good faith effort to correct the falsifications on his SCA, but rather continued 
to mislead and conceal information during his interview with DSS and in a subsequent sworn statement. It was not until he was confronted repeatedly with the 
facts did he finally provide all the required information. Although it is likely that Applicant's father did tell him to lie on his SCA, Applicant was 27 years old at 
the time. Certainly an age where he realized lying on a document under oath merits serious ramifications. Applicant did not consult an authorized person to 
assist him with questions he may have had, but rather chose the route of concealment. Based on Applicant's consistent conduct and his testimony where he 
repeatedly attempted to provide explanations for why he lied, none of which were credible, I find he has not taken steps to reduce his vulnerability to coercion, 
exploitation or duress. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his personal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed, the adjudicative 
process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the "whole person" concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of 
their acts, omissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and 
applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">I considered the whole person and I find Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding criminal conduct and personal conduct, but did mitigate the 
concerns regarding his drug involvement. Therefore, I am persuaded by the totality of the evidence in this case, that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Accordingly, Guideline H is decided for Applicant and Guidelines J and E are decided against Applicant.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
