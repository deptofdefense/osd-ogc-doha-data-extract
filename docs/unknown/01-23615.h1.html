<P>While completing a security form, Applicant failed to reveal his dated alcohol-related arrests.  However, he mitigated this personal conduct and potential 
criminal conduct by his subsequent corrective action, including full disclosures in an investigative interview and by his outstanding conduct on the job where 
Applicant is highly regarded for his integrity and honesty overall.  Thus I conclude that this one example of omitting information on his past conduct was an 
isolated incident of poor judgment.  His current good work record and his several highly favorable references outweigh this one instance of his failure to 
disclose requested information.  Further, he took steps to address the core problem that led to these arrests by voluntarily seeking alcohol treatment in 1990 
which shows his willingness to take corrective actions.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on November 25, 2002.  The SOR detailed 
reasons why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-23615.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over personal conduct (Guideline E) and over criminal conduct (Guideline J),.  Applicant 
responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on November 17, 2002; on February 4, 2003, he submitted a supplemental response where he 
requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel, who on March 12, 2003, attested it was ready to proceed; and the case was assigned to me.  Subsequently, a 
mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to; and a Notice of Hearing issued on March 26, 2003, set the matter for May 1, 2003, at a location near where 
Applicant works and lives.  At the hearing the Government introduced eight exhibits.  (Exhibits 1-8; TR15-18) Applicant did not objection to Exhibits 1-7 
which were all admitted into evidence.  However, he did object to Exhibit 8 as the writer of the memorandum was not present to testify, so Applicant had no 
opportunity to confront her.  (TR 18)  I reserved a ruling on the admissibility of Exhibit 8 until after Applicant had testified.  (TR 18-19)  Subsequently, 
Department Counsel conceded Exhibit 8 was an out of court statement on a controverted fact, and she withdrew Exhibit 8.  (I retained a copy of Exhibit 8 
should it become an issue on appeal.)  (TR 49-50)  The Applicant represented himself, testified and offered four exhibits which were admitted into evidence 
(Exhibits A-D).  The  transcript (TR) was received on May 12, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 38 years old, has worked for Defense Contractor #1 in State #1 since January 2000.  (Exhibit 1)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant attended a computer center in State #1 and received a diploma in 1999.  (Exhibit 1)  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was married in 1992.  He has two stepchildren born in 1979 and 1982.  (Exhibit 1; TR 27)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct and Criminal Conduct     </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On May 11, 2000, Applicant completed and signed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   In response to Question 24, Applicant failed to disclose three 
alcohol-related incidents from the 1989-90 period in response to the question "Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to 
alcohol or drugs?"  He admitted he intentionally left this information off the SF 86 thinking that it could affect his chance of getting the job; he believed the 
form would be used for employment purposes by the company; he did not understand the SF 86 form was for a security clearance.  Further he did not know the 
dates of the convictions and thought that after seven years such convictions were dropped from his driving record.  He subsequently graduated from a sobriety 
program and has been alcohol free.  He now realizes he had a duty to disclose these arrests.  At the time he did not reveal the information as he did not want 
"any preconceived notions" going to his employer as he saw these arrests as part of his past, not part of his future.  He is now married and no longer conducts 
himself as he did when he was single and used alcohol in the 1989-90 period.  He voluntarily went through alcohol rehabilitation in 1990 to address these issues 
after this third alcohol-related arrest; he subsequently attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for two years.  (Answer; Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; Exhibit C; TR 
21-29, 32) (SOR 1.a. (1), (2), (3))</P> 
 
<P>Applicant denied the allegation in SOR 1.b. (Answer) Applicant had a dispute with his insurance company that provides health care benefits through his 
employer as the claim statements and forms contained his social security number (SSN) as an identifier.  Since he lived in a mobile home park, he feared that if 
such mail were handled carelessly someone would be able to gain access to his SSN; and he could be subject to "identify theft."<A HREF="01-23615.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  He requested that the SSN 
not be used as his identifier, but his company would not provide a separate identifier to him because that might cause confusion at the company.  When he 
questioned why he had to have a SSN number, a Social Security Administration (SSA) representative explained that he needed a SSN to work in the United 
States (US); the representative claimed that if he did not have a SSN he would no longer be a citizen of the US and would be renouncing his citizenship; further 
she explained he would not get retirement benefits.  He later had a conversation with a company representative (Ms. M)<A HREF="01-23615.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> who told him that nothing could be 
done from the point of view of the company as use of the SSN was required for the company to administer the health plan.  He explained to Ms. M what he had 
learned from SSA that to opt out of using his SSN would "in essence be renouncing his citizenship."  He did not tell Ms. M that he intended to renounce his 
citizenship.  He alluded to the possible use of a W-8 form, an Internal Revenue Form, used by persons working in the US without a SSN and explored with her 
the possibility of using that form.  However, he never filed a W-8 form; and he never had any intention to renounce his US citizenship. He has no intent to get 
rid of his SSN.  (Exhibit 2; TR 33-34, 36-38, 48-49)</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>References</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's manager strongly recommended that he be granted a security clearance as he is "an extremely competent" technician, high motivated, an innovative 
problem solver, and extremely security conscience.  On several occasion Applicant identified and reported security incidents.  This manager considers 
Applicant "an honest, well-meaning, and trustworthy individual."  In sum, the manager stated that Applicant is "a highly trusted individual of unwavering 
integrity and is of especially great value to the Army in his current position."  (Exhibit A; TR 40-42, 46-47)</P> 
 
<P>A government manager also recommended that Applicant keep his security clearance; she "highly endorses his 'can do' attitude and his willingness to 'go the 
extra mile' during critical times."  She concluded Applicant is a "trustworthy, honest and reliable individual."  (Exhibit A; TR 37-40, 46)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's pastor who has known him for three years assessed him as a man of character and integrity.  He recommended his security clearance be re-instated. 
(Exhibit A; TR 42-43, 46)</P> 
 
<P>Another manager recommended that his security clearance be granted as Applicant has "proven reliable and honest."  He often interacts and cooperates with 
Applicant on projects, and he has often volunteered to help on after-hours "cutover projects, where extra manpower is limited."  He has observed Applicant to 
be a "responsible and reliable asset."  (Exhibit A; TR 43-44, 46)</P> 
 
<P>The agency network manager strongly recommended that Applicant be granted a security clearance.  She praised Applicant as "an asset to our installation.  He 
is dedicated, highly motivated to solve any network problems that may arise and is very security conscience.  He has discovered and reported security incidents 
while performing his duties."  (Exhibit A; TR 44-46)</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that

<P>The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government advanced security concerns over personal conduct issues as Applicant  on the May 2000 security form failed to disclose his past adverse 
alcohol-related issues in answering question 24.  Applicant's behavior<A HREF="01-23615.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> reflected questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not properly safeguard classified information under Disqualifying Condition 2. </P> 
 
<P>While Applicant conceded his mistake in failing to disclose his 1989-90 alcohol-related arrests, he rebutted and overcome the Government's concerns by 
demonstrating that he has mitigated<A HREF="01-23615.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> this conduct under Mitigating Conditions (MC) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2, the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and the 
individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily; and under MC 5, the individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or 
eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  In his subsequent DSS interview he fully disclosed his alcohol-related arrests and explained his 
efforts in 1990 to seek treatment voluntarily for his condition. He has not subsequently had any alcohol-related arrests; thus, the Government conceded that 
these 1989-90 incidents would no longer be material to a current security assessment as these alcohol-related incidents have not recurred in over ten years. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Further, </SPAN>while Applicant now realizes he had a duty to disclose these arrests,  he was unclear at the time he completed the form over who would have access to 
his SF 86: he did not want to reveal any adverse information to the company that would create "any preconceived notions" on how he worked.  That 
justification alone would be insufficient to mitigate these concerns, but his subsequent conduct on the job is so well regarded as to lead to the conclusion that 
his one instance of omitting this information was an isolated incident of poor judgment.  His current good work record and his several highly favorable 
reference letters outweigh this one instance of his knowing and willful failure to disclose required information on a government form. While he had a duty to 
inform himself and to fully disclose these issues, he took steps to address the core alcohol problem in 1990 in voluntarily seeking treatment which shows his 
ability to take corrective actions.   </P> 
 
<P>Consequently, I conclude that while Applicant misrepresented his background by his "No" answer on the security clearance form, he has mitigated this personal 
conduct by his subsequent sterling work record certified and endorsed by four managers from his company and from the government agency where he serves.  
For example, Applicant's manager strongly recommends that he be granted a security clearance as Applicant is "an extremely competent" technician, high 
motivated, an innovative problem solver, and extremely security conscience as on several occasions he identified and reported security incidents.  This manager 
considers Applicant "an honest, well-meaning, and trustworthy individual."  The manager corroborated  that Applicant is "a highly trusted individual of 
unwavering integrity and is of especially great value to the Army in his current position."  Also, a government manager recommended that Applicant keep his 
security clearance; she "highly endorses his 'can do' attitude and his willingness to 'go the extra mile' during critical times."  She concluded Applicant is a 
"trustworthy, honest and reliable individual."  </P> 
 
<P>The Government failed to establish security concerns over the matters alleged in SOR 1.b.  While Applicant conceded concerns over identity theft led him to an 
acrimonious conversation with a Ms. M, a human resources specialist at his company, this matter alleged does not establish a Personal Conduct security 
concern.  I find Applicant credible when he explained that he simply wanted to explain to Ms. M what he had learned from SSA that to opt out of using his SSN 
would "in essence be renouncing his citizenship."  I accept his version that he did not tell Ms. M that he intended to renounce his citizenship and only alluded to 
the possible use of a W-8 form, an Internal Revenue form, used by person working in the US without a SSN and explored with her the possibility of using that 
form.  While he admitted his conversation with her was made "in anger and also somewhat in jest," that is not a sufficient basis to raise personal conduct 
security concerns as he never filed a W-8 form and never had any intention to renounce his US citizenship. He had no intent to get rid of his SSN despite his 
concerns over identity theft.  </P> 
 
<P>Hence, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraphs 1.a.(1) through 1.a (3) and 1.b. 
under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Government maintains security concerns over Applicant's criminal conduct  in willfully falsifying his SF 86 forms by his failure to disclose the details of 
the 1989-90 alcohol-related incidents which raises a security concern under Title 18 United States Code Section 1001<A HREF="01-23615.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> 
<P>; even though he was never prosecuted 
under this statute or convicted, his conduct, as discussed above under personal conduct, this conduct arguably falls within that statute as his "No" answers were 
given "knowingly and willfully." His failure to make these disclosures raises questions about his security worthiness.  However, as discussed above under 
Personal Conduct, he has mitigated these concerns under Criminal Conduct.  To his credit, Applicant has a successful work record and favorable references.  
Consequently, the actions that led to his 2000 omissions from the SF 86 are mitigated under condition (a) as the behavior was not recent, (d) . . . the factors 
leading to the violation are not likely to recur; and (f) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation from his several favorable references. Thus, after 
considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant on subparagraph 2.a. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 2. </P>
