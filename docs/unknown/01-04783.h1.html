<P>Although the Applicant's past criminal conduct is not recent, his related mental disorder, which is currently in remission, is of security significance.  On three 
separate occasions, in June of 1997, in October of 1998, and more recently in October of 2000, the Applicant failed to take his prescribed medications.  Each 
failure led to psychotic episodes which required hospitalization.  If he goes off his medication again, there is "a 95% likelihood" of another such episode.  In 
light of his recent history, it is too soon to conclude that the Applicant will not again cease taking his medication, thereby becoming psychotic and a security 
risk.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 9, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 4, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on December 6, 2002.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on December 20, 2002, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for 
resolution on January 24, 2003.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's recurring mental disorder and related criminal conduct militate against the 
granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 42 years of age and is 
employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline I - Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders &amp; Guideline J - Criminal Conduct</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a., 1.b., and 2.a.~2.e.  In <STRONG>1992</STRONG>, the Applicant was hospitalized for paranoid delusions (Government Exhibit (GX 6 at pages 1~2).  As a result of this 
hospitalization he was prescribed medication (<EM>id</EM>).  In June of <STRONG>1997</STRONG>, the Applicant was hospitalized with a diagnosis of acute psychosis/psychotic (GXs 7 and 
12, <EM>see also</EM> GX 14).  He had not been taking his medications (<EM>id</EM>).  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 30, 1998, the Applicant was arrested for Public Intoxication (GXs 8 and 9).  Although this charge was subsequently dismissed, the next day, 
October 1, <STRONG>1998</STRONG>, the Applicant was again hospitalized for an acute psychotic disorder (GX 13, <EM>see also</EM> GX 14).  He had failed to take his medications nine 
months prior to this hospitalization (<EM>id</EM>).  On October 9, 1998, the Applicant was charged with and subsequently pled guilty to Possession of a Firearm while 
under a restraining order (GXs 10 and 11).  In part, he was ordered to stay on his prescribed medications (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October of <STRONG>2000</STRONG>, the Applicant was hospitalized for a fourth time, for a condition diagnosed as schizophrenic disorder, paranoid type (GX 6 at page 2).  
Again, he had failed to take his medications for nine months prior to this hospitalization (<EM>id</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On January 3, 2002, the Applicant was given a psychiatric evaluation (GX 6).  His bipolar disorder was found to be in remission.  His was also found to be 
"without any current pattern of high-risk, irresponsible, aggressive, anti-social or emotionally unstable behavior; . . . without any current defect in his judgement 
or reliability . . . ; [and] has insight into the nature and severity of his underlying condition and the need for continuing psychiatric management and treatment . . 
." (GX 6 at page 4).  The last entry notes, however, that the Applicant "has a 95% likelihood of developing another serious episode, which might adversely 
affect his judgement, or reliability insofar as his ability to safeguard classified information is concerned if he were to discontinue taking his prescribed 
medication in the future" (id).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his answer to the SOR, the Applicant avers that he has "no intention of discontinuing medications" (GX 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Criminal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  The criminal behavior was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An opinion by a credentialed mental health professional that the individual has a condition . . . that may indicate a defect in judgement, reliability, or 
stability;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  Information that suggests that an individual has failed to follow appropriate medical advice relation to treatment of a condition, e.g. failure to take prescribed 
medication.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">none.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline I (Emotional, Mental, and Personality Disorders), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) which 
establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's 
adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct 
evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who suffers from a mental disorder may have a defect in judgement, reliability or stability.  The Government must be able to place a high degree 
of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is suffering from a mental disorder, which, in the opinion of a credentialed mental health professional, if untreated with medications is a security 
concern.  The Applicant avers that he will not cease taking his medications, but his recent mental history indicates that a risk continues to exist.  In 1992, he was 
diagnosed with a mental disorder and prescribed medication.  In 1997, in 1998 and again in 2000, the Applicant had to be hospitalized as a result of his failure 
to take his medications.  His last hospitalization was a little more than two years ago; and as such, in light of the Applicant's history of repeatedly not taking his 
medications, it is too soon to say he will not again repeat this cessation and become a clear security risk.  Paragraph 2, Guideline I is thus found against the 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to the Applicant related past criminal conduct, the September~October occurrences are distant enough in time, more than four years ago, so as not to be of 
current security significance.  Paragraph 1, Guideline J is therefore found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his mental disorder.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline I, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline I.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: FOR THE APPLICANT</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
