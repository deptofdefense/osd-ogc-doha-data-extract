<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant.  On 30 September 2003, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR)<A HREF="02-26976.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign
Influence) and Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR
in writing on 15 November 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The
case was assigned to me on 5 March 2004.  On 17 March 2004,<A HREF="02-26976.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> I convened a hearing to consider
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 25 March 2004.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	I left the record open so that Applicant could provide documentation of his attempts to
resolve his debts.  With no objection from the Government, I admitted the two documents he
submitted-a letter from the IRS (Ex. A) and a credit report (Ex. B).</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant is a 51-year-old senior software systems engineer.  Tr. 20.  He has two master's
degrees and a Ph.D. in engineering.  Tr. 19.  Applicant was married to his first wife from 1983-95. 
She had a pen pal in Russia.  In 1992, Applicant and his wife visited Russia to see the pen pal.  Tr.
17.  Applicant found Russia to be very interesting.  Tr. 18.  It was the first of 11 trips he made there. 
Tr. 37.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In 1995, Applicant and his first wife divorced.  Ex. 1 at 4.  Since his divorce, Applicant has
traveled to Russia on eight occasions.  Ex. 1 at 7.  He met his current wife through an internet dating
service.  She is a Russian citizen.  Ex. 2 at 4.  Applicant made his last trip to Russia in July 2000 to
bring his then fianc&eacute;e to the U.S.  Tr. 37.  They married in September 2000.  Ex. 1 at 4.  The first few
months of the relationship was stormy.  Apparently Applicant's wife, who is about 22 years younger
than Applicant, expected the U.S. to be "the land of milk and honey" and wanted to go out and party
after he came home from work tired.  Tr. 32.  Police were called to the house on at least two
occasions.  Applicant moved his wife out of the house, but she returned the next day and tried to
break in with a hammer.  Tr. 18.  Applicant called the police who arrested his wife.  The couple
separated in December 2000, and Applicant decided to file for divorce.  <EM>Id.</EM>  After counseling, the
couple got back together in March 2001.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant's wife's son is also a Russian citizen.  He is almost 7 years old.  Answer; Ex. 1 at
5.  He lives with his mother and Applicant in the U.S. and has no contact with his biological father. 
Applicant's parents-in-law are resident citizens of Russia.  Answer.  </P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	Applicant has a friend who is a resident citizen of Russia.  Although they are more friends
than business associates, Applicant and his Russian friend operated a business together for a short
period.  Applicant acted as a go-between to facilitate the outsourcing of computer programming work
from the U.S. to his friend in Russia.  He has contact with this friend about twice a year.  Tr. 34-36;
Answer.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In 1995, when Applicant divorced his first wife, they were each making about $60,000 a year. 
Applicant asserts that he was left with considerable bills because of the divorce.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	In 2000 and 2001, Applicant incurred tax debts to the IRS totaling approximately $84,000. 
Tr. 20-21.  Applicant claims the debt was incurred as a result of his exercise of stock options at a
company for which he worked.  Although Applicant was making about $86,000 a year in salary, he
failed to pay the taxes on his stock options at the time.  When the stock declined in value from about
$60 a share to 21Â¢ a share, Applicant was unable to finance the tax bill.  To further aggravate the
situation, Applicant was laid off from his job in April 2001, a month after reconciling with his wife. 
Applicant retained the services of tax consultants to negotiate a settlement of his tax debt.  On 9
March 2004, the IRS offered to settle the consolidated debt from tax years 2000 and 2001 for
approximately $46,000, but required Applicant to accept the offer by 17 March.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S.
518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently
trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at
527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States,
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well
as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec.
Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  Eligibility for a security
clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive. 
</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the
disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  In evaluating
the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative
process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security
clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865
&sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and
the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">	Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal
or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being
eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a
nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed
in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.
May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the
burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden
of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's wife (&para; 1.a.) and stepson (&para; 1.b.) are citizens of
Russia residing in the U.S.; he has contact with his parents-in-law about once every three months
(&para; 1.c.), he has a friend who is a resident citizen of Russia (&para; 1.d.); and he has traveled to Russia at
least eight times since 1995 (&para; 1.e.).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate
family, or other person to whom he  may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for
foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para;
E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserts he is a loyal American citizen who would not betray the U.S.  Tr. 19.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The
Government has not alleged, and the evidence does not show, Applicant is anything but a loyal U.S.
citizen.  However, the issue is not his loyalty, but whether he is <EM>vulnerable </EM>to foreign influence that
could result in the compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In evaluating an applicant's foreign associates, it is appropriate to consider the significance
of the applicant's spouse's ties to foreign countries.  ISCR Case No. 01-02452 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov.
21, 2002).  There is a rebuttable presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation
to, his spouse's immediate family members.  ISCR Case No. 01-26893, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 505 at
*8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant admitted each of the factual allegations in the SOR.  Applicant has immediate
family members-his wife and stepson-who are citizens of a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  The
evidence also established Applicant has close ties of affection or obligation, through his wife, to his
in-laws, who are citizen residents of Russia. DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  Although Applicant has ties of
affection for his Russian friend, they do not appear to be close ties.  I find for Applicant on &para; 1.d.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	It is a mitigating condition if the foreign associates are not agents of a foreign power or in
a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force an applicant to choose
between loyalty to the foreign associate and loyalty to the U.S.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.  In analyzing
whether a foreign associate is in a position of vulnerability, it is necessary to assess the nature of the
foreign country.  It is common knowledge that, although not as hostile to the U.S. as the Soviet
Union was, Russia continues to operate an aggressive intelligence service that actively seeks access
to U.S. secrets.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 02-27444, 2003 DOHA LEXIS 448 at *6 (Testan, A.J. Jun. 6, 2003). 
Russia has assisted the U.S. in mediating international conflicts.  While its human rights record has
improved, it is still uneven.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="02-26976.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  Applicant failed to demonstrate his in-laws were not in a position to
be exploited by a foreign power.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	After carefully examining all of the evidence, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the
foreign influence security concerns attributable to his wife and his in-laws.  As Applicant's stepson
is only seven, and has lived most of his life in the U.S., I find he does not represent a security
concern.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  As Applicant has not visited Russia in several years, I find his past travels do not raise a
security concern.  I find for Applicant on &para;&para; 1.b. and 1.e.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F-Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant had delinquent debts to the IRS for tax years 2000 (&para;
2.a.) and 2001 (&para; 2.b.) and other delinquent accounts that had been charged off by the creditors (&para;&para;
2.c.-2.i.).  An applicant who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts
to generate funds.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The Government has established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions that he
has a history of not meeting his financial obligations (DC E2.A6.1.2.1) and is unable or unwilling
to satisfy his debts (DC E2.A6.1.2.3.).  Applicant alleged some of the debts resulted from conditions
largely beyond his control-his divorce in 1995 and being unemployed for approximately eight
months in 2001.  MC E2.A6.1.3.3.  I find this mitigating condition inapplicable to Applicant's case
because he did not act responsibly with regard to these debts.  He made eight trips to Russia from
1995-2000 and drove a vehicle on which he was making monthly payments exceeding $1,100.  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant made a good-faith effort to repay some of his creditors and resolve others through
negotiation and compromise.  MC E2.A6.1.3.6.  But Applicant still has several delinquent debts
which he is neither paying nor has a plan to resolve.  Although the IRS agreed to compromise his
tax delinquencies for $46,000, there is no evidence Applicant has agreed to that offer.  Under the
circumstances, Applicant has not mitigated his adverse financial condition.  I find against Applicant
on &para;&para; 2.a.-2c. and 2.f.-2.i.</SPAN></P>
