<P>Applicant's personal conduct and sexual behavior in Country #1 were deemed to be "unbecoming a federal supervisor," so  in February 1999 his agency issued 
a Notice of Proposed Removal from his federal agency position.  While Applicant was allowed to resign, he was permanently barred from serving in any 
position in Country #1 and was barred for one year from serving with the federal agency.  Applicant's defenses were not credible in the light of the adverse 
statements taken from three women he supervised and in light of his admission that he had an improper sexual relationship with a woman he supervised.  His 
alcohol-related conduct no longer raises security concerns. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on October 29, 2002.  The SOR details reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="01-20163.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over personal conduct (Guideline E), sexual behavior (Guideline D) and Alcohol 
Consumption (Guideline G).  Applicant responded to the SOR  in a November 8, 2002 answer where he admitted allegations 1.a., 1.d., and 3.a, but denied the 
remainder and requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who on June 3, 2003, attested it was ready to proceed.  The case was assigned to another judge on July 2, 2003, 
and was reassigned to me on July 14, 2003.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing was agreed to.  A Notice of Hearing issued on July 24, 2003, 
set the matter for August 27, 2003, at a location near where Applicant works and lives. </P> 
 
<P>At the hearing the Government offered three exhibits which were admitted into evidence and called Applicant as an adverse witness. (Exhibits 1-3<A HREF="01-20163.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>)  
Applicant's personal representative called  three other witnesses and offered one exhibit which was admitted into evidence.  (Exhibit A)   The  transcript (TR) 
was received on September 8, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>    </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 57 years old, has been an employee of a defense contractor in State #1 since August 1999.  In January 2000 he applied for a security clearance by 
completing a Security Clearance Application (Standard Form 86) (SF 86).  He was unemployed from April to August 1999.  From to 1992 to 1999 he was in a 
federal position (WS-16) as chief of housing maintenance in an overseas assignment in Country #1.  He was granted a secret clearance in January 1992.  Earlier 
he served in the U.S. military from 1964 to 1972.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was married in November 1964 and has two children, born in 1966 and 1967.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER></STRONG></SPAN><STRONG>Personal Conduct, Sexual Behavior, and Alcohol Consumption </STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In his Defense Security Service (DSS) June 2001 interview Applicant admitted that he consumed alcohol to excess on a daily basis when he was a civil service 
employee assigned to Country #1 from December 1984 to 1989.  From December 1989 to 1990 he was employed in the U.S. in State #2 and did not drink to the 
point of intoxication.  From 1990 to January 1992, he was assigned in the U.S. in State #3 where he continued to drink but not to the point of intoxication.  
From January 1992 to March 1999 he was assigned to Country #1 he continued to drink; he would decrease his consumption when he was on call 24 hours a 
day.  From April 1999 to June 2001 he consumed two to three mixed drinks or beer per day after work.  He is usually intoxicated once a year.  He has never had 
an alcohol-related accident.  Applicant's wife testified that she sees no evidence that he currently drinks to excess.</P> 
 
<P>In his SF 86 Applicant admitted he accepted deferred retirement in April 1999 following allegations of misconduct.  While he was assigned in Country #1 
Applicant supervised 350 people and oversaw maintenance for over 8,000 housing units in eleven different military installations.  Almost his entire work force 
was Country #1 nationals under a master labor contract.  Applicant had influence over their promotions.  He selected three positions personally: his secretary 
and the controllers who scheduled the daily maintenance.   In his position as a supervisor he had responsibilities with respect to Equal Employment Opportunity 
(EEO) and received EEO training, briefings, and materials.  He admits he was very much aware of the agency EEO policies and that as a supervisor it was his 
responsibility to enforce these EEO policies.  However, his conduct as detailed below showed that he disregarded the agency's sexual harassment policies.</P> 
 
<P>In February 1999Applicant  was issued a Notice of Proposed Removal from his position because of  "conduct unbecoming a federal supervisor" as a result of an 
investigation into his sexual misconduct.  During the investigation of Woman #3's complaint, the investigator learned of Applicant's sexual harassment actions 
towards other women Applicant supervised, Woman #1 and Woman #2.  In his reply Applicant admitted we had an affair with Woman #1, but he denied the 
charges with respect to Woman #2 or Woman #3.  </P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Woman #1 was Applicant's secretary from July 1993 to August 1998; she also acted as a translator for him.  Woman #1 told the agency investigator that 
there were several non-consensual sexual incidents while she was Applicant's secretary.  During her first week on the job, Applicant asked her to lunch and 
asked her if she had any previous sexual experience, which she thought was too personal a question.  She reported to the investigator several incidents where 
he touched her inappropriately as well as several incidents from 1995-96 where Applicant would call her into his office and require her to have sexual 
contact after normal duty hours.  Woman #1 told the investigator she did not report these incidents at the time because "in local culture a woman is at a 
disadvantage when this type of conduct is reported."  Applicant admits that Woman #1 had previous experience as a licensed practical nurse and helped him 
when he had medical problems in 1995.  He had some paralysis in his legs and was unable to walk very well.  During that period he worked out of his home 
for a month.  Woman #1 would bring papers to his home and massage his legs. Applicant admits he engaged in a sexual relationship<A HREF="01-20163.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> with Woman #1 from 
June 1995 to August 1995.  Since he was her supervisor, Applicant admits "that it was inappropriate for a supervisor to have an affair with a subordinate."  
He told his wife about this affair in 1995 when he was recovering from surgery, and they were reconciled. </LI> 
 
reported Applicant touched her inappropriately once at a housing unit and once at an officer's house.  He would also touch her inappropriately on random 
occasions in the office from October 1997 to November1998.  </LI> 
</UL> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>In November 1998 Woman #3<A HREF="01-20163.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> filed an official sexual harassment charge<A HREF="01-20163.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> concerning Applicant with an agency official who in December 1998 appointed 
someone to investigate this complaint.  The Notice of Proposed Removal reports an incident with Woman #3 where they went to a vacant housing unit 
where Applicant grabbed her and asked if she was "open-minded."  Even though she rejected his advances, he continued to make advances until she left the 
unit.  Applicant was reported to have asked, "Now did I upset you?"  She replied, Yes, you did."  He responded "Well, I'm just a dirty old man."  She 
replied, "Yes, you are."</SPAN></LI> 
 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant was removed from his federal position effective April 1999 and appealed his removal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  As part of an 
October 1999 settlement agreement, Appellant agreed to resign instead of being terminated as he could defer his retirement.  Under the settlement agreement he 
paid his own attorney's fees.  Applicant was barred permanently from serving in any position in Country #1 and barred from any position with the agency for 
one year.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The Government established security concerns over Applicant's personal conduct which  falls with the following Disqualifying Conditions (DC): (1) reliable, 
unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, co-workers, neighbors, and other acquaintances; </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">(4) personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities 
which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail; and (5) a pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations, including violation of any written or recorded agreement made between the individual and the agency.  Even though he knew the 
EEO rules prohibited such conduct, Applicant engaged in a sexual relationship with Woman #1 from June 1995 to August 1995  while he was her supervisor.  
Applicant concedes "that it was inappropriate for a supervisor to have an affair with a subordinate." Further, while Applicant claimed the relationship was 
consensual, Woman #1 told the agency investigator that the relationship was not mutual, but she did not report the incidents because of the potential for stigma 
in the local culture and her fear that no action would be taken.  Also in violation of EEO rules, Applicant  made improper advances towards two other women 
he supervised.  Women #3 reported his inappropriate conduct to a senior agency official who instigated an investigation.  After the agency investigation was 
complete, the agency in February 1999 issued a Notice of Proposed Removal from his position because of his "conduct unbecoming a federal supervisor." 
Although in his reply he denied the charges with respect to Woman #2 or Woman #3, he was removed effective in April 1999.  He appealed his removal to the 
erit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  As part of an October 1999 settlement agreement, Appellant agreed to resign instead of being terminated as he was 
able to defer his retirement.  The Settlement Agreement barred him permanently from serving in any position in Country #1 and barred from any position with 
the agency for one year.  While he advised his wife of his affair with Woman #1, he did not advise her of his sexual advances towards Women #2 and #3.  This 
conduct establishes Applicant's questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could 
indicate that he may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">While Applicant offered references who think highly of his technical and management expertise, that evidence is not sufficient to counterbalance his repeated 
poor judgment in engaging in conduct that was prohibited by federal agency policies and regulations on sexual harassment.  Hence, after considering the 
Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 1.a., 1.b., 1.c. and 1.d. under SOR Paragraph 1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>Sexual Behavior</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">Applicant's conduct discussed above also raises security concern under DC 4, as his sexual behavior in Country #1 reflected his lack of judgment or discretion.  
Applicant admits improper sexual contact with Woman #1.  While he denies any improper conduct with Woman #2 and #3, the agency investigation which was 
admitted into evidence, documents his sexual misconduct with each of these three women that he supervised as detailed in the Findings of Fact.  Applicant  
admits he was knowledgeable of the agency EEO policies and that as a supervisor it was his responsibility to enforce these EEO policies.  However, his conduct 
as detailed above shows that he disregarded the agency's sexual harassment policies and engaged in conduct unbecoming a federal supervisor when he was a 
civil servant in Country #1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">While Applicant offered references who think highly of his technical and management expertise, that evidence is not sufficient to counterbalance his repeated 
poor judgment in engaging in sexual behavior with women he supervised  that was prohibited by agency policies and regulations on sexual harassment.  Since 
he continues to deny he engaged in any improper conduct with Women #2 and #3, there is insufficient evidence of mitigation or reform of his conduct.  Hence, 
after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 2.a., 2.b. and 2.c. under SOR 
Paragraph 2</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">The Government has security concerns over Applicant's past alcohol abuse where he admits he drank to excess in the 1984-89 period, but there is no indication 
he was ever diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem.  Thus, Applicant's conduct falls with DC   5, habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of 
impaired judgment.  On the other hand conditions that could mitigate  security concerns (MD) include: MC 2, the problem occurred a number of years ago and 
there is no indication of a recent problem.  After considering the Appendix I Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant 
on subparagraphs 3.a. under SOR Paragraph 3.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>  This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as 
amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.    
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A>  Exhibit 3A is a U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) Initial Decision issued August 1999 after Applicant appealed the agency action to remove him 
from his supervisor position in April 1999; the October 1999 Settlement Agreement; the February 1999 Notice of Proposed Removal; the inquiry report 
submitted by the military investigator, including statements.  Exhibit 3B is Applicant's Civilian Performance and Promotion Appraisals, job description, and 
Notification of Personnel Actions (SF 50).  Exhibit 3C is a copy of the agency's Equal Opportunity and Treatment Policy as well as the Sexual Harassment 
policy of the agency as well as the implementing instruction, and educational materials distributed to employees.  Exhibit 3D is additional agency educational 
materials distributed to employees. (TR 13-16; 23) 
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A>  In his DSS Statement of June 2001 Applicant described the sexual relationship with Woman #1 as "mutual" and claimed they never engaged in anything of a 
"sexual nature" while in the workplace or during the course of their duties.  He would meet her at the "Love Monkey Motel" or his home during the affair.  
Woman #1 told the agency investigator that the relationship was not mutual, but she did not report the incidents because of the potential for stigma in the local 
culture and her fear that no action would be taken. 
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A>  Given the agency investigator's report, I do not find credible Applicant's denial in his DSS statement of June 2001 that he had no sexual contact with 
Woman #2 except for having hugged her "as this was customary in our workplace."  
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A>  In his DSS Statement of June 2001 Applicant attributes Woman #3's complaint about him to her being bitter because he once counseled her to stop showing 
public displays of affection with another employee. 
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Given the agency investigator's report, I do not find credible Applicant's denial </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">in his DSS statement of June 2001 that he had no sexual contact with Woman #3.  He 
admits only that he inspected housing units and had coffee with her.
