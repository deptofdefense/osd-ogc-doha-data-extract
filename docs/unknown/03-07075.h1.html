<P>Applicant, with an otherwise meritorious work record, has a recurrent history of sexual harassment and proposition allegations in the workplace (four 
altogether), for which he was either transferred or terminated, and a warning issued by a local police department to avoid any further contract with a female 
neighbor who reported him making verbal and written proposals about having a sexual affair.  Applicant mitigates security concerns associated with his 
behavior by demonstrating he has since shown his wife the SOR containing the allegations, receiving a favorable prognosis from a credentialed medical 
professional regarding his diagnosed impulsive disorder, and otherwise showing the exercise of sound judgment in the workplace and in the company of young 
women whose softball team he coaches.   Clearance is granted.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 14, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on July 2, 2004 and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on September 24, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing 
on October 27, 2004.  A hearing was convened on October 27, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six exhibits; Applicant relied on three witnesses 
(including himself) and five exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on November 9, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guidelines D and E, Applicant is alleged to have engaged in sexual misbehavior on several occasions between December 1982 and February 2001 that 
resulted in his (a) termination by employers for acts of sexual harassment and (b) of a warning by a local police department in State C not to have further 
contact with a female neighbor after she reported his harassing her with verbal and written proposals about having a sex affair.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">            For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the allegations: his termination in February 2001 for allegations of sexual harassment and his 
termination in March 200 for allegations of sexual harassment of a minor female worker.  But he denied the remaining allegations without explanation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 45-year-old analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are 
incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born and raised in State A and enjoyed a strong religious upbringing.  He enlisted in the AF following his high school graduation and served 15  
years of active duty before being discharged from active duty in 1990.  After completing his AF active duty tour, he served on a two-year mission abroad for his 
church.  Upon his return from his mission, he lived with his parents for a short time before marrying his current spouse in 1981 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1; R.T., at 61-62).  In 
1992, Applicant returned to college following a hiatus from formal education and obtained a degree in psychology from a  university in State A in 1995 (ex. 1; 
R.T., at 95-96).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between December 1982 and February 2001, Applicant was terminated by four different employers on the basis of claims filed employees of sexual 
harassment.  The first such claim arose out of his employment with Company 1 in December 1982.  According to a complaint filed by a female co-worker, 
Applicant asked her for sexual favors, in addition to making sexual innuendos.  While Applicant denies the specific allegations, he does admit to participating 
in sexually charged banter with several employees (including the complaining employee) and later being removed from management  following the employee's 
complaint (R.T., at 130-32).  He was thereafter afforded an opportunity to work in the same store with employees he previously supervised (R.T., at 131-32), 
but declined the offer and transferred to another store owned by the same employer (where he was terminated a month later.  Inferences warrant he made sexual 
innuendos while bantering with several co-workers (the complainant included) that might have been interpreted by her as a sexual request.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1983, a neighbor of Applicant's filed a complaint with the local police of State A, claiming Applicant had harassed her with verbal and written 
proposals about having a sexual affair with him (<EM>see</EM> ex. 6).  The complainant declined Applicant's sexual overtures and requested police protection, while 
declining to prosecute Applicant.  No charges were brought against Applicant as the result of the neighbor's complaint.  Applicant, in turn, was advised by the 
police to have no further contact with the neighbor (<EM>see</EM> ex. 6; R.T., at 66-67).  By all accounts, he did not.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 1985, several co-workers of Applicant complained to his employer's management that he had made inappropriate sexual innuendos to them.  Both 
Applicant and his wife (who worked at the same store) were relocated to another store together.  Although he never told his wife of the complaints at the time, 
he has since shown her the SOR (R.T., at 136).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">More recently (in March 2000), Applicant was terminated from a local grocery store in State B, upon allegations of sexual harassment of a minor female 
worker.  Applicant acknowledged a sexual issue with the worker (a minor at the time), who informed her parents, who, in turn, reported her claims to the store's 
management (R.T., at 99-100, 141-43).  After being confronted by store management about the worker's claims, Applicant was terminated.  Once terminated, 
he told his wife of the verbal exchange he had with the worker that resulted in his termination.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was also terminated from a local restaurant in State B for allegations of sexual harassment of a co-worker: this in February 2001.  After engaging the 
co-worker in a one-time conversation at the restaurant that included sexual innuendos, he was called into the office by his supervisor and confronted with the 
co-worker's account.  Upon admitting to the incident, he was promptly terminated.  Applicant later told his wife of a sexual conversation he had with the female 
worker and his ensuing termination (R.T., at 139-40).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant kept his wife generally informed of the various sexual harassment allegations before he received the SOR (R.T., at 53-54) and  assures his wife was 
not surprised at the allegations contained in the SOR he has since showed her.  Besides discussing the SOR with his wife, he has also told his supervisor of the 
allegations (R.T., at 125, 157).  However, he has not told any of his coworkers of the SOR allegations, or members of his church (R.T. at 157). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has two children from his long marriage (a loving one by all accounts).  Active in his church, he has regularly tought Sunday school to girls and boys 
(R.T., at 55-56).  He coaches teams of young ladies in softball competition without any complaints of inappropriate comments or behavior on his part.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Not knowing why he bantered with co-workers in the past, he has since  sought and received psychiatric counseling.  In July 2004 he voluntarily enrolled in a 
mental health counseling center in State B (<EM>see</EM> exs. D and F).  Following his initial intake assessment, he was assigned to outpatient individual and group 
sessions.  Between August 2004 and November 2004, he is credited with attending four individual sessions (in addition to his group sessions) and was assigned 
a diagnosis of impulse control disorder nos (not otherwise specified) on the DSM-IV scale (<EM>i.e., </EM>312.30).  Applicant, in turn, was given a favorable prognosis by 
his treating physician and licensed counselor, based on the circumstances of his current work environment, that not only requires a security clearance, but 
doesn't place him in close proximity to female co-workers on a routine basis (<EM>see</EM> ex. F).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since his last incident of sexual comments and/or innuendos in February 2001, Applicant has had no further reports of exchanges with co-workers or any 
females outside his marriage.  He assures he will avoid any situations with female co-workers in the future that might place him at risk to sexual harassment or 
innuendo allegations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant receives high praise from his colleagues who know him well at work and socially.  A computer soft-ware developer with a security clearance who has 
known him through coaching interaction with girls' softball (ages 12 to 16) describes Applicant as compassionate and prudent with the young women players 
and extolled by team members for his coaching and interaction skills (R.T., at 21-25).  This acquaintance never observed Applicant engage in any inappropriate 
conduct with the young women softball players and characterizes Applicant as consistently above reproach with the players he has coached (R.T., at 27-29).  A 
team counterpart of Applicant's with his defense contractor describes Applicant as reliable and trustworthy in all of his dealings with him (qualified only by his 
lack of familiarity with the specific allegations in the SOR).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Sexual Behavior</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Concern: </EM>Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to 
coercion, exploitation, or duress, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate 
that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under  the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in 
the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that 
evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  
Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By all accounts, Applicant has a meritorious professional record and no history of involvement with law enforcement before or after his warning by State A 
police in 1983 to avoid any further contact with a neighbor who had claimed he harassed her in a report she filed with the police.  Applicant does bring a history 
of employer terminations (five in all) attributable to sexual harassment reports that raise some security concerns about his judgment and reliability under the 
guidelines covered by Guideline D (sexual behavior) and Guideline E (personal conduct).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before showing his wife of many years the SOR he received, Applicant had kept his wife generally informed of some of the sexual harassment and proposition 
allegations, but not all of them.  He has since made his wife aware of the specific allegations covered in the SOR. While he has not disclosed all of the details of 
his employment separation circumstances with the five covered employers, his employment history provided in his SF-86 includes the employers who are 
covered in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b (<EM>see</EM> ex. 1).  Checks with these employers could be expected to yield the reasons for his respective terminations from their 
employment rolls.  He has since been diagnosed by a credentialed medical professional and licensed counselor who assign a diagnosis of impulse control 
disorder nos (not otherwise specified) on the DSM-IV scale (<EM>i.e., </EM>312.30) and give a favorable prognosis, based on the circumstances of his current work 
environment, that not only requires a security clearance, but doesn't place him in close proximity to female co-workers on a routine basis.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions entitle the Government to invoke four of the disqualifying conditions (DC) under Guideline D for sexual behavior: E2A4.1.2.1 <EM>(sexual 
behavior of a criminal nature ,whether or not the individual has been prosecuted</EM>), E2A4.1.2.2 (<EM>Compulsive or addictive sexual behavior when the person is 
unable to to stop a pattern of self-destructive or high risk behavior or that which is symptomatic of a personality disorder</EM>), E2A4.1.2.3 (<EM>Sexual behavior that 
causes the individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>), and E2A4.1.2.4 (<EM>Sexual behavior of a public nature and/or  that which reflects lack 
of discretion or judgment</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's actions raise security concerns as well over his same actions under the personal conduct Guidelines: E2A5.1.2.1 (<EM>Reliable, unfavorable information 
provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances</EM>) and E2A5.1.2.4 (<EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that 
increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress) that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has since been diagnosed by a credentialed medical professional and licensed counselor who both assign a diagnosis of impulse control disorder nos 
(not otherwise specified) on the DSM-IV scale (<EM>i.e., </EM>312.30) and give a favorable prognosis, based on the circumstances of his current work environment, that 
not only requires a security clearance, but doesn't place him in close proximity to female co-workers on a routine basis.  This favorable prognosis combined 
with the favorable impressions he has made on his supervisors and coworkers and persons in a position to observe Applicants' favorable coaching relationships 
with young women he coaches in organized softball reveal positive overall changes in his inter-personal working relationships with young women in and out of 
the work place.  With his spouse since notified of his sexual harassment/proposition allegations, the risks of any recurrent vulnerability are mitigated for 
security clearance purposes.  Applicant may avail himself of  the mitigating conditions covered in the Guidelines that reflect his elimination of prior sexual 
harassment/proposition allegations as a source of vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress.  Applicant, in turn, may take advantage of two mitigating 
conditions: E2.A4.1.3.4 and E2.A5.1.3.4 (<EM>The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>) of the Guidelines for sexual behavior 
and personal conduct, respectively.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant's recurrent sexual harassment conduct, Applicant is credited with mitigating security 
concerns relative sexual behavior and judgment lapses associated with his actions. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the underlying conduct 
covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f of Guideline D  and subparagraph 2.a of Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of 
the Directive.</SPAN></P>
