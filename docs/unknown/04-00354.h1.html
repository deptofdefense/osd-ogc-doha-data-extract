<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 30, 2003, Applicant applied for a security clearance and completed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On October 4, 2005, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  The SOR detailed reasons under Guideline J (criminal 
conduct) why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a sworn, written statement, dated October 24, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.  Department Counsel indicated the 
government was ready to proceed on January 26, 2006, and the case was assigned to me on March 23, 2006.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 6, 2006, 
and the hearing was held, as scheduled, on April 26, 2006. During the hearing, two Government exhibits and the testimony of four Applicant witnesses 
(including Applicant), were received.  The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 5, 2006.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the factual allegation and the conclusory allegation pertaining to criminal conduct under Guideline J (subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.).  Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of 
same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged.  He had 
previously been granted a secret security clearance in November 1983,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> but, in September 1985, that clearance was administratively terminated as unneeded.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  
He has been employed as an electrician by several different government contractors on contracts at the same military facility since June 1983.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  He has worked 
for his current employer since September 2003.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> His current immediate supervisor and a former supervisor both support his application and have characterized 
him in very positive terms.  Applicant is a "role-model employee," and is considered very dependable, well respected, and honest.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  He served in an inactive 
enlisted status with the U.S. Army from October 1970 until July 1973, and with the Army National Guard from August 1973 until August 1974,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and received 
an honorable discharge.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He was married in February 1983,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and has two step-sons.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 28, 1973, Applicant agreed to accompany his uncle during a drug deal because his uncle was afraid to go alone due to threats.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Unfortunately 
for Applicant and his uncle, the "buyers" turned out to be state drug agents.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He was arrested and charged with unlawfully, feloniously, knowingly, and 
intentionally possessing, with intent to sell, phencyclidine.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  On the advice of his attorney, he pled guilty and was sentenced, in part, to imprisonment for four 
years at the state penitentiary.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  He was actually incarcerated from about August 1974 until about April 1975, first in the county jail for two months, and then 
the remainder of the term in a minimum security penitentiary.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was released from imprisonment in April 1975, and entered into a work-release program while residing in a half-way house under state control until 
January 1976.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The half-way house was run on the honor system and those in the program were not locked in at night, but also not permitted to go to bars or 
other prohibited locations.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  During the day, Applicant worked in another city at a regular job in private industry outside the state system.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  In January 1976, 
upon being released from the work-release program, he was paroled.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  He was released from parole in about 1978.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Notwithstanding his arrest and conviction, 
Applicant continues to maintain his innocence and contends he was not a participant in the drug dealing of his uncle.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since his release from the work-release program, Applicant has not been involved in any further criminal activity.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  With added maturity, he has turned his life 
and lifestyle around, and has been active in union and community affairs.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below<STRONG>.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  The memorandum provided policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precluded the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances.  The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or 
arine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information 
and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."  Implementing guidance attached to the 
memorandum indicated that provision 1, described above, "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses, 
with sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 9, 2004, Section 1062 of the Ronald W. Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 was approved and adopted, amending 
portions of Subsection (c)(1) of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, thereby altering it to read as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, <EM>and was incarcerated as a 
result of that sentence for not less than one year.</EM> (Emphasis of change supplied)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security" or "clearly consistent with the national interest."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> For the purposes herein, 
despite the different language in each, I have concluded all of the standards are the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences that are grounded on mere speculation or 
conjecture.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which raises a security concern under the 
Directive that it wis not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline J.  By his own admission, Applicant was involved in criminal behavior in 1973 that resulted in his 
arrest and a conviction.  As a consequence of the September 1973 arrest and subsequent conviction for the one charge, he was sentenced to four years 
imprisonment.  As noted above, he was actually incarcerated in a county jail and then the state penitentiary from about August 1974 until about April 1975.  
From April 1975 until January 1976, he was in a work-release program while residing in a half-way house under state control.  Applicant's criminal conduct 
clearly falls within Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (<EM>allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether 
the person was formally charged</EM>), CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (<EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.3. (<EM>conviction in a 
Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I acknowledge CC DC E2.A10.1.2.3. has not yet been formally amended to conform with the 2004 change in the law, and no implementing guidance has yet 
been provided.  Nevertheless, in complying with the mandate that these security clearance review decisions be fundamentally fair commonsense decisions, I 
have concluded that the new law was intended to be applied retroactively.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It has been over 31 years since that conviction and sentence.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The criminal conduct for which he was convicted is not considered recent since it ceased with his 
September 1973 arrest. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has refrained from further criminal conduct and has apparently turned his life around.  Those facts support the application of 
Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>the crime was an isolated 
incident</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An analysis of Applicant's conduct under the "whole person concept," reveals knowledgeable, voluntary participation as a colleague of his uncle in illegal drug 
dealing that occurred over 31 years ago, when Applicant was 23 years old, with substantial evidence of rehabilitation, and little likelihood of recurrence.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A 
person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past when there is a substantial indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or 
rehabilitation.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under other circumstances, it would appear that Applicant's criminal conduct is mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was clearly incarcerated for eight months while in the county jail and the state penitentiary.  However, because the term "incarcerated" has not been 
defined in 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, there remains one unresolved issue: whether or not his nine months in a work-release program and mandated residency in a state-controlled half-way house from April 1975 until January 1976, constitutes incarceration under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government argues the work-release/half-way house segments of Applicant's sentence constituted incarceration or imprisonment under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  
Applicant differs, and contends time spent in a work-release/half-way house does not constitute incarceration or imprisonment.  A review of case law seems to 
flow primarily from interpretations arising from the application of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (USSG) in criminal cases.  Unfortunately, the ambiguity in 
10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 also exists in USSG, for &sect; 4A1.1(2)(b) thereof only defines "sentence of imprisonment" as "a sentence of incarceration."  Likewise, the plain-English definition defines "incarceration" as "Imprisonment; confinement in a jail or penitentiary."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  Imprisonment, however, is not limited to a place usually 
associated with that purpose.  It is a "coercion exercised upon a person to prevent the free exercise of his powers of locomotion."  Complicating the issue is the 
differing interpretation of the same status of some situations such as work-release/half-way house, characterized as "chameleon" in nature, depending on the 
purpose of the review.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  Status is examined one way in determining how much credit an individual should receive for "time served," and in another way in 
determining how much enhancement to a sentence should be added for prior criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 7<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit, in <EM>U.S. v. Timbrook</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> explored the issue of whether a sentence of work-release in a county jail is a sentence of imprisonment under USSG.  In 
that case the sentencing judge imposed the work-release as a substitute for 24-hour confinement, but treated the sentence as imprisonment and stated there is "a 
big difference between ordering someone into a work release setting as opposed to a treatment setting or halfway house."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  The court rejected the defendant's 
contention that a "sentence of work release is not a "sentence of imprisonment" because it is analogous to a community treatment center or a halfway house, 
both of which are not deemed "imprisonment" under [USSG]."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  It cited two decisions from other circuits which held:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Confinement in a community treatment center is not "incarceration" within the meaning of the Guidelines provisions.  A community confinement center or a 
halfway house is not a "secure jail facility" almost by definition.  "Houses" and "Treatment Centers" are not supposed to be jails.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Nevertheless, the court held the sentence of work-release in a county jail is a sentence of imprisonment under USSG.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It also cited favorably two decisions from other circuits.  The first case, by the D.C. Circuit, in <EM>U.S. v. Ruffin</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> involved a defendant who had previously been 
sentenced "to the custody of the Attorney General. . . for imprisonment for a period of (1) year.  Work release ordered.  Hours: 6:00 AM thru 6:00 PM Monday 
thru Friday."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A>  The Court rejected the defendant's argument that work-release was not imprisonment, and held the "sentence "involve[d] a term of 
imprisonment," his work release was "part of the term of imprisonment," he actually served a period of imprisonment."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The second case, by the 5<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit, in <EM>U.S. v. Brooks</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> involved a defendant who had previously been sentenced to a boot camp.  The court rejected the 
defendant's argument that time spent in a state boot camp should not be counted as a "term of imprisonment" for purposes of calculating his criminal history 
category under USSG.  Instead, it found that physical confinement is a key distinction between sentences of imprisonment and other types of sentences,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> and 
discussed the USSG "commentary" in terms of the types of sentences not requiring twenty-four hours a day physical confinement, such as "probation, fines, and 
residency in a halfway house."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A>  Since the defendant in that case was not free to leave the boot camp, the court held his confinement there constituted 
imprisonment.  The Court cited favorably three decisions from other circuits, including <EM>U.S. v. Ruffin</EM>, cited above, the 10<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit, in <EM>U.S. v. Vanderlaan</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> and 
the 9<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit, in <EM>U.S. Schomburg.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Court in <EM>Vanderlaan</EM> discussed supplementary illustrations on criminal history under USSG, and noted:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The example states that a sentence of probation imposed upon an offender on the condition that he reside in a halfway house would be treated as a non-imprisonment sentence.  But where an offender is sentenced to imprisonment with a recommendation for halfway house placement, the sentence would be 
treated as a sentence of imprisonment.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An earlier 7<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit decision, in <EM>Ramsey v. Brennan</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> discussed a situation where the defendant argued he should have received credit toward his prison 
sentence for the period he served in a half-way house before his criminal trial.  While the case seemingly turned on the issue of the term "in custody," and the 
court referred to the term as a "chameleon,"<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> the court agreed with the government and an earlier 5<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit decision, in <EM>U.S. v. Smith</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A> that "custody" in that 
situation did not include time spent in a halfway house awaiting trial.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In a halfway house ("residential community center" in bureaucratese) the inmate or resident is confined only at night, placing him in a twilight zone between 
prison and freedom.  Whether such confinement should count as time served toward his prison sentence-whether the deprivation of liberty by confinement in a 
halfway house is sufficiently like prison to be treated the same in deciding how long the convicted criminal should serve-is not a question susceptible of 
rational determination, at least by tools of inquiry available to judges.  It is a matter of judgment, or policy, or discretion. . . .<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 9<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit, in <EM>Brown v. Rison</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> disagreed, rejecting both the unique and the ordinary and obvious meaning of the term.  Instead, it chose to examine the 
conditions of the defendant's confinement to the treatment center and concluded those conditions fell "convincingly" within both the plain meaning and the 
obvious intent of the term "custody."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A>  In that case, the defendant was required to spend each evening and night, from 7:00 PM to 5:00 AM, at the center, 
without outside contact.  He was subject to all of the center's regulations, and was required to maintain his employment, restrict his travel, and be subject to 
drug testing.  The Court concluded that the he was "subject to 24-hour supervision by the center, which was acting as an agent of the criminal justice system, 
and he was physically incarcerated there for a substantial part of each day for nearly a year."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A>  It found that the restraints on his liberty were sufficient to 
constitute custody for the purposes of sentencing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The 6<SUP>th</SUP> Circuit, in <EM>U.S. v. Rasco</EM>,<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> provided a different perspective.  The Court rejected the earlier interpretation of the USSC commentary, discussed above.  In 
its view, the USSC commentary does not categorically exclude detention in a half-way house from the definition of a "sentence of incarceration" for purposes 
of computing USSC sentences, nor does it exclude halfway house placement from the "sentence of imprisonment."  "Such an interpretion would elevate the 
importance of a defendant's place of detention over the reason for which the detention was imposed."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant argues that the term of his placement in a half-way house should be considered as a part of his probation or his ultimate parole as it was not part of 
his original sentence.  He also urges that the characterization of the placement should be given very little weight.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A>  While it is true that the quality of the 
evidence herein is superficial, there being no police or court records in evidence, the evidence supplied by Applicant to the government, through his SF 86, 
sworn statement, response to SOR, and his testimony, was generally consistent.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> Applicant was sentenced to four years imprisonment, and after spending two 
months in the county jail, and six months in the state penitentiary, he was moved to a half-way house where he was entered into a work-release program.  Upon 
the end of the work-release program, he was paroled.  There was no mention of probation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also argues the applicability of the canon of strict construction of criminal statutes, or rule of lenity, which commands that genuine ambiguities 
affecting a criminal statute's scope be resolved in the defendant's favor.<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A>  However, as noted, the rule promotes "fair notice to those subject to the criminal 
laws, to minimize the risk of selective or arbitrary enforcement. . . ."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A>  It only "properly comes into play when, at the end of a thorough inquiry, the meaning of 
a criminal statute remains obscure."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A>  In this instance, the ambiguity of a criminal statute is no longer the focus of our analysis because the matter has moved 
on from a criminal venue to an administrative one.  I conclude the rule of lenity in this case is no longer a consideration.  Instead, since this is now a matter 
dealing with the interests of national security, the rule is reversed.  "[S]ecurity-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="04-00354.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted above, all of the evidence herein flows directly from Applicant's pen or mouth as there are no police or court records in evidence.  Likewise, the 
government offered nothing to describe with any additional specificity the exact nature of the half-way house or work-release program.  Accordingly, based on 
all of the above, I conclude Applicant's placement in this particular work-release program and mandated residency in a state-controlled half-way house from 
April 1975 until January 1976, does not constitute "incarceration" under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.  This nine month period is a status or condition substantially short of 
"imprisonment" or "incarceration" as those terms are generally defined.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The period of actual incarceration time served (eight months) excludes this matter from the revised portions of Subsection (c)(1) of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (<EM>has been 
convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, was sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, and was incarcerated as a result of that 
sentence for not less than one year</EM>)<EM>.</EM>  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Consequently, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">10 U.S.C. &sect; 986</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, as revised, does not apply in this instance.  Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation 
and explanation, successfully mitigated and overcome the government's case.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR are concluded in favor of 
Applicant.</SPAN></P>

the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to
