<P>Applicant is a 23-year-old never married man employed as an IT technician for a governmental contractor. He is unable to mitigate the security concerns under 
Guideline E based on the cumulative effect of his criminal conduct (constituting a pattern of rule violations) as well as his false answer in response to a specific 
question on his security-clearance application seeking information about his police record. Clearance is denied.</P>

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On May 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline E for personal conduct.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR on June 5, 2003, wherein he admitted to the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.f, which alleged criminal conduct. He 
denied the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h, which alleged falsification of his security-clearance application and failure to disclose certain matters 
during an interview with an agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). He also requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</P> 
 
<P>On September 24, 2003, DOHA assigned this case to another administrative judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. Subsequently, the case was 
reassigned to me due to caseload considerations. On October 1, 2003, a notice of hearing was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for October 29, 2003. 
Applicant appeared without counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. The record was left open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentary 
evidence. That document, a letter of recommendation from Applicant's supervisor, was timely received and, government counsel having no objection, it is 
admitted into the record as Applicant's Exhibit C. DOHA received the hearing transcript November 6, 2003. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 23-year-old never married man. He is a high-school graduate who has attended some college, although he has not earned a degree. He is 
employed by a governmental contractor as an IT technician. His work duties consist of providing IT technical support to the employees and servicemembers of 
a military department at its national headquarters. He has worked for this company, or its successor, since June 1999.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is very good at his job. He has worked in various capacities as he has grown and matured into his job. His supervisor, a retired military officer, 
describes Applicant as a "reliable, talented, tenacious technician" who because of his ability routinely works with general officers and members of the senior 
executive service. Applicant was working in the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, and, according to his supervisor, was essentially "blown out of his office." 
Applicant was back to work within 48 hours and worked long days for weeks assisting in restoring IT services to his customers. </P> 
 
<P>Outside of work, Applicant is actively involved with a church and he professes a strong religious faith. Applicant's church involvement consists of leadership 
roles in various youth activities. </P> 
 
<P>In January 1998, at the age of 17, Applicant was arrested and charged with the felony offense of hinderment in State 1. The offense stemmed from an incident 
between Applicant and his mother when a dispute went beyond mere disagreement and his mother called the police. After spending about three weeks in a 
juvenile facility without incident, Applicant was released and the charge was dismissed.</P> 
 
<P>In November 1998, Applicant was charged with the offense of reckless driving<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> in State 2. He was found guilty and sentenced to serve confinement for 30 
days, to pay a $100.00 fine and $186.00 court costs, and to perform 50 hours of community service. Applicant's sentence to confinement was suspended and he 
was placed on unsupervised probation for 18 months. </P> 
 
<P>On or about July 12, 1999, Applicant completed a security-clearance application, also known as a SF 86.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> In response to a specific question<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> about felony 
offenses, Applicant answered "Yes" disclosing the hinderment offense. In addition, in response to a catchall question<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> about his police record, Applicant 
answered "No" thereby denying any arrests, charges, or convictions within the last seven years. Nowhere in his security-clearance application did Applicant 
mention the November 1998 reckless driving offense. Applicant's explanation for not disclosing the incident is that as he considered the matter a traffic offense 
with a $100.00 fine, the incident was not reportable.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On July 18, 1999, back in State 1, Applicant was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice (a misdemeanor) and public intoxication. These offenses 
stemmed from an incident when Applicant challenged an off-duty police officer working as security at a bowling alley where Applicant and a friend were 
bowling. Represented by counsel, Applicant agreed to plead guilty to the public intoxication offense (although he had not drunk any alcohol) in exchange for 
favorable treatment of the obstruction of justice offense. Consequently, the obstruction of justice offense was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>nolle pros</EM>sed, and Applicant was ordered to pay a 
$100.00 fine and $40.00 in court costs on the remaining offense.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Four months later in November 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in State 1. This offense stemmed from an 
incident when Applicant and a friend were sitting in a car parked outside the friend's residence. The key was in the ignition and the car was turned on to provide 
heat while Applicant and his friend were loudly singing along to Top-40 tunes. Police investigated and a blood-alcohol test revealed Applicant had been 
drinking alcohol. Under age at the time, Applicant was charged with DWI, which was subsequently reduced to reckless driving. The state court ordered 
Applicant to serve confinement for 30 days (suspended) and to pay a $250.00 fine and $80.00 court costs.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On or about October 30, 2000, now in State 3, Applicant was arrested and charged with public urination. This offense stemmed from an incident when 
Applicant took the blame for two women in his group of friends who were unable to hold their water. Applicant paid a $25.00 fine as a result of the arrest. 
Although Applicant's explanation for this matter is unusual, it is nonetheless deemed credible.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">As part of the background investigation, Applicant was interviewed in March 2002 by an agent of the DSS. As the agent did not testify at the hearing, the record 
evidence is less than clear exactly how this interview occurred. The initial interview took place to address the hinderment offense. During that discussion, 
Applicant mentioned the reckless driving offense in State 2, but could not provide details. Subsequently, another interview was scheduled and Applicant then 
provided the details. After doing so, Applicant was asked if any other matters should have been revealed in his July 1999 security-clearance application. 
Applicant responded in the negative. Thereafter, the agent brought up the post-SF 86 offenses and interviewed Applicant about those matters. The result of that 
interview was Applicant provided a signed, sworn statement wherein he addressed those matters.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">    </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions for each applicable security guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant 
and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the presence or 
absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case 
can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the record evidence as a whole, the following adjudication guidelines are most pertinent here: 
Guideline E for personal conduct.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant 
has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In addition, an applicant has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard and handle classified information. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate a person may not properly safeguard or handle classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Likewise, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying 
for security processing, processing for a position of responsibility, or in other official matters is a security concern. It is "deliberate" if it is done knowingly and 
willfully. Omission of a past arrest or past drug use, for example, is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, 
misunderstood the question, or thought the arrest had been expunged from the record and did not need to be reported. </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, considering the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline E. Notwithstanding his assertions to the contrary,  
Applicant deliberately falsified his answer to Question 26 on the security-clearance application. First, the reckless driving offense in State 2 was not merely a 
speeding offense resulting in a small fine. The seriousness of the offense is reflected by the sentence, which included 30 days' confinement (suspended), 50 
hours of community service, as well as the $100.00 fine and court costs. The fact that one part of the sentence was a fine of less than $150.00 did not make the 
entire matter unreportable. Indeed, a reasonable person reading that question would realize that the reckless driving offense was required to be disclosed. 
Second, I cannot excuse his answer because he misunderstood the question in light of the less than $150.00 fine qualification. Applicant was well aware of the 
November 1998 reckless driving offense when he completed the SF 86 in July 1999. He chose to answer the question using an overly-legalistic or hyper-technical approach instead of providing a full, frank, and candid answer. Under the facts and circumstances here, I conclude his answer was deliberately false 
and thus, disqualifying condition (DC) 2<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> applies against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The same cannot be said, however, for the interview with the DSS agent. The record evidence does not establish, by substantial evidence, that Applicant 
deliberately tried to withhold or conceal his post-SF 86 offenses. In simpler terms, the government has not proved its case on this point. Accordingly, the 
finding is for Applicant on SOR subparagraph 1.h.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's history of multiple criminal offenses, none of which were alleged under Guideline J for criminal conduct, is a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">warning sign that he may not possess 
the necessary attributes to be granted access to classified information. The cumulative effect of this pattern of rule violations creates a security concern and thus, 
DC 5<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> applies against Applicant. Taken together, the information is indicative of irresponsible behavior, questionable judgment, or unreliability, or all three. It 
may be argued that none of these individual items or incidents may seem particularly significant or noteworthy. But viewed as a whole, as I'm required to do, 
these matters create doubt about Applicant's fitness for access to classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions (MC) under Guideline E and conclude none apply. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under the whole-person concept, however, Applicant does receive some credit. His criminal conduct started in January 1998 when his was 17-years-old and 
continued, with the exception of the public urination offense, for about two years ending in November 1999. Accordingly, Applicant's youthful age and lack of 
maturity at the time do mitigate these matters somewhat. But Applicant's continuing assertions that he did nothing wrong by not revealing the reckless driving 
offense in response to Question 26 prevents me from excusing the falsification as not recent, as an isolated incident, or as another youthful mistake or 
indiscretion. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">An applicant who deliberately fails to provide full, frank, and candid answers to questions on a security-clearance application is not a suitable candidate for 
access to classified information. Making a false statement to the federal government is serious business not easily mitigated or explained away. Indeed, doing so 
is a federal offense.<A HREF="02-12975.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Viewed in this light, and considering the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has not mitigated or extenuated his false answer in 
response to Question 26. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is an enthusiastic young man and a capable IT technician who has earned the respect of his customers and supervisor. In the future, with the benefit of 
additional seasoning and with counsel from a wise mentor, Applicant may be able to affirmatively demonstrate he is a mature, responsible, reliable, and 
trustworthy individual who can be counted on to disclose all derogatory information when required. As of today, however, Applicant has not met his ultimate 
burden </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him security clearance. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline E is decided against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
