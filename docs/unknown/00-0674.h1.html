<P>Possession of a British passport obtained prior to naturalization of a Hong Kong citizen is mitigated by surrender of the passport to the British 
Embassy and submission of an application to renounce British nationality; presence of the father, grandmothers, and, at times, mother in Hong

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On April 4, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated May 1, 2001, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and 
requested a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned on May 14, 2001, to Administrative Judge Heiny and reassigned to Administrative Judge Mason on June 18, 2001, and a 
notice of hearing was issued by the latter on July 16, 2001.  The undersigned Administrative Judge received the case assignment on July 17, 2001.  
The undersigned held the hearing as scheduled on August 9, 2001.  The Department Counsel presented three exhibits ("exhs") and the testimony of 
the Applicant as a hostile witness.  The Applicant's case consisted of the presentation of two exhibits, but no witnesses. The undersigned 
Administrative Judge received the transcript ("tr") of the hearing on August 16, 2001.  A third document was submitted by the Applicant on August 
14, 2001, and was admitted ("exh. C") without objection on August 20, 2001.  The record in this case closed on August 20, 2001. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two guidelines: paragraph 1, Guideline C (foreign 
preference), and paragraph 2, Guideline B (foreign influence).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 24-year-old member of the engineering staff of a U.S. Government contractor since July 1999.  The Applicant seeks to obtain a 
Secret personnel security clearance.  Tr pages 91-93.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was born in Hong Kong, then a British crown colony, in June 1977.  Hong Kong was handed over to the People's Republic of 
China (PRC) on July 1, 1997, by the United Kingdom.  Exh. 1, page 8.  The Applicant emigrated with his parents to the United States when he 
was 13 years old in August 1990.  Tr page 55.  He attended high school in the United States during 1991-95.  He obtained a British National 
(Overseas) passport in October 1994 valid for ten years.  He attended college in the United States during 1995-99.  He was awarded a 
bachelor's degree in computer science by that institution in May 1999.  He has never married.  Exh. 1.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant and his mother were naturalized as U.S. citizens in November 1997, and his brother was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in December 
1998.  The Applicant obtained a United States passport in December 1997 valid for ten years.  The Applicant did not use his British passport 
after he was naturalized.  Exh. 2.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's 51-year-old father is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong.  He is also a permanent resident alien of the United States, where he 
vacations twice a year for about a week at a time.  Because his Hong Kong employer requires him to work in Hong Kong, the Applicant's father 
is unable to establish a sufficient period of continuous U.S. residence to qualify for U.S. naturalization.  He has no substantial property interests in 
Hong Kong and plans to live in the United States when he retires.  SOR answer; tr pages 81-82.  The Applicant's two grandmothers, ages 75 and 
70 and each born in pre-World War II China, are also citizens and residents of Hong Kong.  Tr pages 46-49.  The Applicant's mother, a U.S. 
citizen and resident, spends summers in Hong Kong with his father.  Tr page 84-86.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant travels to Hong Kong frequently for pleasure and, while there, sees his father and his grandmothers.  He traveled there in the 
summers of 1996 and 1997<A HREF="00-0674.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and in December 1997 and December 1998.  Exh. 1.  He has also traveled to Hong Kong every year since, except 
in 2000, and was last in Hong Kong a few weeks before the hearing.  Tr pages 43-44, 57-61, 79.  Since the Applicant was naturalized in 
November 1997, he has consistently and exclusively used his U.S. passport for travel.  During May 1997-September 1997, the Applicant worked 
as an "audit trainee assistant" for a U.S. accounting firm in Hong Kong.  Exh. 1, pages 4-5.  He opened an account with the local bank to facilitate 
the cashing and depositing of his paychecks.  His account balance generally fluctuated then between HK$2,600 and HK$7,200.  Exh. 2.  At the 
time he closed the account in May 2001, the balance was HK$5,239.40 (about US$670).  SOR answer; exh. A; tr pages 45, 63.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant received the ASD(C<SUP>3</SUP>I) memorandum (exh. 3), dated August 16, 2000, in May 2001, and promptly inquired of the British Embassy 
at Washington, D.C., how to renounce his British citizenship.  He received an application and instructions by reply letter of June 7, 2001 (exh. B) 
and completed the application on June 18, 2001 (exh. C).  Receipt of the application for renunciation of British citizenship was acknowledged by 
the British Embassy at Washington, D.C., by its letter dated July 2, 2001 (exh. B).  <EM>See </EM>tr pages 35-38.</P>

</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an 
individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance 
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully 
considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>GUIDELINE C - FOREIGN PREFERENCE</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be 
prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>    [2nd] Possession and/or use of a foreign passport;</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>    [1st] Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P>    [2nd] Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship;</P> 
 
<P>    [4th] Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other 
countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>    [1st] An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or 
present in, a foreign country;</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>    [1st] A determination that the immediate family mem-ber(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or 
associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States;</P> 
 
<P>The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</P> 
 
<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P> 
 
<P>c. Age of the applicant.</P> 
 
<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences involved.</P> 
 
<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</P> 
 
<P>The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-able participation</P> 
 
<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P> 
 
<P>The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P> 
 
<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance 
may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall 
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and 
logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on 
October 14, 1995.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has 
said:</P> 
 
<P>"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard 
without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a 
security clearance] by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's 
national security determinations."</P> 
 
<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go 
to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, 
substantial evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error 
below.<A HREF="00-0674.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through 
evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's 
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail 
to safeguard properly classified information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold 
a security clearance.<A HREF="00-0674.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor 
of the witness who testified, the undersigned concludes that the Applicant successfully rebutted and overcame the Government's case with regard 
to Guideline C.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant obtained a British National (Overseas) passport in October 1994 when he was not a dual national but simply a citizen of Hong 
Kong resident in the United States.  He retained possession of that passport after he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 1997 and 
after he also was issued a U.S. passport.  This falls within the scope of DC #2, which is identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>, notwithstanding that he did not 
use the British passport after November 1997.  In mitigation, the Applicant's dual nationality is based solely on his birth in Hong Kong (MC #1), 
and his alleged foreign preference is premised upon his obtaining the British passport before he was naturalized (MC #2).  He has mitigated and 
overcome the Government's concern that retention of a foreign passport is incompatible with a U.S. personnel security clearance (exh. 3) by 
surrend-ering the foreign passport and taking concrete steps to renounce his foreign citizenship.  <EM>See </EM>MC #4,</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">which is also identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  Therefore, SOR &para; 1 (foreign preference) is concluded favorably to the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility and demeanor 
of the witness who testified, the undersigned concludes that the Government established its case with regard to Guideline B.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's father, who was born in, lives in, and remains a citizen of Hong Kong, now under the control--as well as sovereignty--of the 
People's Republic of China (PRC) is an im-mediate family member whom he sees frequently and corresponds with monthly.  The Applicant's 
grandmothers, citizens and residents of Hong Kong, are likewise family members, notwithstanding that the Applicant himself testified that he is "not 
attached" to them.  Tr pages 78-80.  Moreover, his mother, though a U.S. citizen and resident, usually stays in Hong Kong every summer.  All this 
evidence falls within the scope of DC #1 under Guideline B, which is identified on page 5 <EM>supra</EM>.  The vulnerability of the Applicant to coercion 
and/or noncoercive persuasion by the PRC through pressure or other threats, express or implied, upon his family members in Hong Kong is not 
merely speculative or an abstract possibility given the totality of the Applicant's conduct and circumstances.<A HREF="00-0674.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The Applicant testified that he 
would report to the U.S. Government any such pressure or threats rather than compromise U.S. classified information and run the risk of 
incarceration.  Tr pages 73-79, 87-95.  However, such evidence cannot be taken a face value, for example, in absence of evidence that the 
Applicant has acted consistently in comparable situations.  ISCR Case No. 99-0511 (Dec. 30, 1999) at 10-11.  The burden of proof is on the 
Applicant to demonstrate the applicability of MC #1 under Guideline B, which is identified on page 5 <EM>supra</EM>.  ISCR Case No. 99-0597 (Dec. 13, 
2000) at 6-7.  The Applicant has not met that burden and does not persuade that the risk of compromise is minimal.  Therefore, SOR &para; 2 (foreign 
influence) is concluded adversely to the Applicant.<A NAME="F.3 Directive analysis"></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative 
process discussion at enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on page 5 <EM>supra</EM>.  The nature and extent of the Applicant's 
vulnerability to foreign influence is serious, and the likelihood of its continuation is highly probable.  His lack of expressed concern with the actions 
of the PRC in national security matters and corresponding expressed faith in the invulnerability of Hong Kong to pressures from the central 
government are troubling, raising reasonable doubts about his eligibility of a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
