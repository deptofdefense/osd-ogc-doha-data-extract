<P>Applicant is a twenty-six-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor.  After submitting a security clearance application indicating marijuana 
usage from November 1994 through July 2000, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia in 2002. Applicant commenced 
abstinence from drugs and completed both a counseling assessment and drug education program.  Applicant's abstinence may be contingent upon his being 
granted a security clearance.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 15, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing why, pursuant to Guideline H-Drug Involvement, it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Consequentially, DOHA recommended that the matter be referred to an Administrative Judge to determine whether 
a clearance should be granted.</P> 
<P>In a written statement dated January 23, 2004, Applicant admitted with explanation the allegations contained in the SOR.  In his response, Applicant also 
elected to have his case decided on the written record.  Department Counsel submitted the government's case on May 17, 2004. A complete copy of the file of 
relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> was provided to the Applicant. Applicant was afforded the opportunity to file objections and submit evidence in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received a copy of the FORM on June 21, 2004, but did not submit any additional material.  I received this case on 
February 1, 2005.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>I have thoroughly reviewed the entire record and make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 26 years old and has been employed as a software engineer by a defense contractor since January 2001.  On March 26, 2001, Applicant completed 
a security clearance application (SF-86) in which he admitted to using marijuana from November 1994 until July 2000,<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> when he quit in order to prepare for 
potential employment and drug testing.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN>  In that same month, March 2001, Applicant resumed his use of marijuana.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>On February 17, 2002, Applicant was arrested for possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) and of drug related paraphernalia.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Prior to trial, Applicant 
began abstinence and underwent assessment at a professional counseling service.  The program director recommended six weeks of education, total abstinence, 
and attendance at one Alcoholics Anonymous/Narcotics Anonymous meeting per week.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> Applicant completed the substance abuse education program.</P> 
<P>On May 3, 2002, Applicant pled guilty to the paraphernalia charge.  He received a $95 fine (suspended) and one year of unsupervised probation before 
judgment.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN>  The possession of marijuana charge was terminated by a <EM>nolle prosequi</EM>.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant has expressed his future intentions regarding drugs and drug abuse:</P> 
<P>In 2002: "I quit smoking pot after being arrested because of the impact it could have on my career....  I believe I had a dependency on it in the past and don't 
intend on using it in the future."<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>In 2003: "I have completely abstained from any illegal substance use or abuse since (the arrest).  I stopped using drugs completely because of my job and also 
because I did not want to go through this same ordeal again.  My friends no longer use marijuana or other drugs and I do not associate with any individuals 
involved in illegal activity."<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>In 2003: "The possibility exists that I may in the future use drugs but I will not use them while in a sensitive position. I do not intend to use drugs while in 
possession of a security clearance or a position of trust."<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P>In 2004: "I took the initiative to get rehabilitated by going to (a counseling program's substance abuse education program) which I successfully completed.  It 
helped me realize some misconceptions I had about smoking marijuana and the true damage it can do not only to my body, but my career and personal life....  I 
am thoroughly dedicated not to become involved with any illegal substance in the future based upon my experience in life and the Court system."<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
<P>In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As the term implies, they are "guidelines."  As such, they are but 
part of an amalgam of elements for the Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well 
as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  The concept of the "whole person"<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good 
or bad, present or past - should be considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To 
that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the 
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individuals age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P>Guideline H-Drug Involvement.  <STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information</STRONG>.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  
In other words, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that 
industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied 
decision as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case.  Applicant's improper and illegal drug abuse, including the purchase, possession, and use 
of marijuana, is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  The Directive clearly expresses the Government's concern 
regarding drug involvement in provision E2.A8.1.1.1. (<EM>improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or 
ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized 
disclosure of classified information</EM>).  Drug abuse is defined in provision E2.A8.1.1.3 (<EM>the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates 
from approved medical direction</EM>).  Drugs are identified and defined in provision E2.A8.1.1.2.1. (<EM>drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified 
and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants,, and hallucinogens</EM>)).  
Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls within Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DI DC) E2.A8.1.2.1. (<EM>any 
drug abuse</EM>) and DI DC E2.A8.1.2.2. (<EM>illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant quit smoking marijuana in February 2002. He began his drug abuse in the middle of high school and continued through college, only temporarily 
ceasing his usage in order to "be able to get a job and be able to pass a drug test."<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Shortly after securing employment and around the time he certified his SF 
86 application, he resumed his use of marijuana.  Facing trial over his 2002 arrest, Applicant again chose to abstain from drugs.  Given the extent and duration 
of his overall use, the brevity and circumstances of his prior attempt at abstinence, and considering his last drug usage was barely three years ago, his 
involvement was recent.  Therefore, I find no application of DI MC E2.A8.1.3.1. (<EM>the drug involvement was not recent</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's drug involvement was not isolated or aberrational.  Despite seven to eight months of abstinence, his drug use from 1994 to 2002 was on-going.  
Applicant maintains that he smoked around 10 times in high school and "habitually while in college but the usage was recreational"<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">; his counselor's report 
states that he "used marijuana at age 16 ... and smoked it daily, stating it is his drug of choice, while in high school and college."<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Despite these varied 
portrayals, however, I need not make a determination as to which is closest to the truth; either version shows that his involvement was neither isolated nor 
aberrational.  Therefore, I find no application of DI MC E2.A8.1.3.2. (<EM>the drug involvement was an isolated or aberrational event</EM>). </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's intent not to abuse drugs in the future is also a concern.  His first attempt at abstinence served only as a means to an end: to get a job and pass a 
drug test.  Once the hurdles were passed,  he resumed his usage.  Indeed, he began smoking marijuana again in the very month he certified on his SF 86 
application that his drug use had ended.  One year later, Applicant was arrested and faced trial.  He again commenced abstinence, but this time he also  sought 
counseling and completed a substance abuse education course.  In contrast to his first attempt at abstinence, however, there is no evidence of a return to drugs.  
oreover, three of his subsequent statements articulate a mature, considered reflection on his ordeals, drugs, and abstinence, and include affirmative statements 
that he does not intend to use drugs in the future.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, however, has also stated that his abstinence from drugs may be conditional.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Such equivocation brings into question the degree of resolve 
underlying his other comments, and raises the risk that he may return to improper or illegal behavior.  Moreover, as this tribunal has noted in the past, a 
conditional vow muddies the waters as to an Applicant's true intent and teeters on the brink of DI DC E2.A8.1.2.5.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> (<EM>failure to successfully complete a drug 
treatment program prescribed by a credentialed medical professional. Recent drug involvement, especially following the granting</EM> <EM>of a security clearance, or an 
expressed intent not to discontinue use, will almost invariable result in an unfavorable determination.</EM>).  While Applicant's language does not rise to "an 
expressed intent not to discontinue use," it does little to mitigate the concerns that improper and illegal drug involvement raises.  Although two years have 
passed since he articulated this conditional language, it is still too recent to gauge Applicant's true resolve, reliability, trustworthiness, and suitability for 
security clearance.  Given this concern, I am compelled to resolve the issue in favor of the Government.<A HREF="02-18780.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Therefore, I find no application of DI MC 
E2.A8.1.3.3.(<EM>a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM>).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Pursuant to DI MC E2.A8.1.3.4, <EM>satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program including rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without 
recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional can mitigate security concerns. </EM>Applicant's substance abuse education 
program and abstinence, however, do not rise to the level of prescribed treatment program defined in the Directive.  Therefore, I find no application of DI MC 
E2.A8.1.3.4.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The whole person, including Applicant's rehabilitative efforts, abstinence, and maturation,  also has been considered.  In 2001, Applicant resumed his drug 
usage after a brief period of abstinence while, in the same month, he certified that his drug abuse was behind him.  To have done so raises additional questions 
regarding judgement, reliability, and trust.  Based on the record before me, I question whether there has been sufficient time since his arrest, his latest 
abstention, and his expression of conditional abstinence to build the degree of trust necessary to enter into the fiduciary relationship that is so fundamentally a 
part of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered all the evidence in this case.  I am not satisfied Applicant presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the case against him.  Accordingly, 
Guideline H is decided against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
