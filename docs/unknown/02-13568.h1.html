<P>While Applicant's financial problems raised security concerns because of his delay in resolving debts to creditors, he has now resolved his debts or has a plan in

financial problems on his 2001 security questionnaire.  Thus, he has mitigated these security concerns. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on April 21, 2003.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="02-13568.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over finances (Guideline F) in paragraph 1 and over personal conduct (Guideline E) in 
paragraph 2. Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on May 7, 2003, and requested a hearing.</P> 
 
<P>The case was assigned to Department Counsel who indicated on June 9, 2003, that the case was ready to proceed and the case was assigned to Judge John Metz 
that day.  Because of regional rotation of assignments, the case was re-assigned to me on June 30, 2003.  Subsequently, a mutually convenient date for hearing 
was agreed to and a Notice of Hearing, issued on July 17, 2003, set the matter for August 11, 2003.  At the hearing the Government introduced eight exhibits 
which were admitted into evidence (Exhibits 1-8).  Applicant testified and offered seven exhibits (Exhibits A through G) which were admitted into evidence; he 
asked for seven days to submit additional evidence.  I granted him seven days, until August 18, 2003, to submit further evidence to Department Counsel and 
granted the Government seven days until August 25, 2003, to review and submit the evidence to me.  (TR 89-90, 98) </P> 
 
<P>Applicant submitted his documents by facsimile on August 11, 2003.  Department Counsel did not object to his submissions and forwarded the documents to 
me on August 25, 2003.  Consequently, Applicant's Exhibits H and I were admitted into evidence and the record closed.   The transcript (TR) was received on 
August 20, 2003.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant, 48 years old, has been employed by Company #1, a defense contractor in State #1, since April 2001.  Applicant received a Certificate of Appreciate 
for his outstanding attendance record from April to July 2001.  Previously, from 1999 to 2001 he worked for Company #2, a company in State #1 that went 
bankrupt.  From 1992 to 1998 he owned his own business in State #2.  (Exhibit 1, Answer, Exhibit C, G; TR 21, 56-56, 71-72)</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a high school degree which he received in 1973 in State #1.  He married in 1983 and has four children.  Although they were separated in State #2 
in 1997-98 and his wife filed for divorce in State #2 in 1997, they reconciled and are now living together in State #1.  (Exhibit 1; TR 28-29, 41-43; Exhibits A, 
F, I)  </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Finances and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>When Applicant applied for a security clearance in April 2001, he completed a Questionnaire for National Security Position (Standard Form 86) (SF 86).  
(Exhibit 1)   When he filled it out, he focused on the question on whether or not he had ever been charged with a "felony," and knew he had not been, so he did 
not carefully read the remainder of the questions about past arrests.  He did not intend to mislead by not disclosing his misdemeanor arrests.  (TR 31-32, 55, 91-92)</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Applicant failed to disclose on the form in answer to Question 23.d. that he had a police record after he was charged in October 1996 with Driving a Motor 
Vehicle While Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor (DUI) and/or Drugs and Assault in State #2.  The DUI charge was amended to Negligent 
Driving/First Degree, and he was fined $375; the Assault Charge was dismissed at the request of the victim in November1996.  Applicant first disclosed this 
information to a Defense Security Service (DSS) Special Agent in December 2001.  (SOR 1.a, 1.a.(1))   (Exhibits 1, 2) Applicant denied the falsification 
allegation as when he completed the form, this incident "never rang" to his mind as it was an isolated alcohol-related arrest.  He also denied the allegation as 
the DUI charge was dropped after he passed the Breathalyzer Test; he asserted he and his wife were "in a conflict" which led to the assault charge as there 
was a red mark on her wrist that the police noted after she called them.  When she testified that she was not hurt or assaulted, the assault charges were 
dropped.  Applicant's wife confirmed his version that she was not injured. (Exhibits 1, 6, 7, 8; Answer; TR 32-37, 58-63, 78-80; Exhibit I)</LI> 
 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Applicant disputed that he falsified his SF-86 in response to 23.f., concerning his Police Record, when he did not disclose his December 1997 arrest for 
Assault/Domestic Violence which was dismissed in January 1998 at the request of the victim.  (SOR 1.b. and 1.b.(1))   He never was arrested for this 
incident and was not aware his wife had pressed charges until after he left State #2.  He admitted that once again he and his wife were in confrontation when 
his young son, five at the time, called the police; but he was not arrested, was not detained by the police, and the charges were dropped after his wife 
provided a statement.  His wife stated this "heated" argument occurred when they were separated and after she had filed divorce papers when he came to the 
family home.  Before he knew the police were looking for him, Applicant independently decided to leave State #2 and return to state #1.  Thus, the police 
were unable to contact him.  The pending charges were dismissed based on information from the wife. Applicant first disclosed this information to a DSS 
Special Agent in December 2001.   He  stated he had never seen the citation until the Government sent it to him in preparation for the hearing. (Exhibits 1, 3; 
Answer; TR 37-40, 63-69; Exhibit I)</LI> 
 
beyond his ability to manage them; he had no intent to mislead.  He has substantial assets that outweighed his debts.  (SOR 1.c.)  (Answer; TR 73-77)</LI> 
 
 
<P>With respect to his finances, Applicant explained that he had a series of medical problems after he was involved in an accident in 1990 which injured his leg, 
and he stayed home from 1990-92.  He had fourteen surgeries on his left leg from 1995-96.  He later developed heart problems in 1998.  As a result, he had 
multiple hospital bills that contributed to his financial problems.  Also he was off work for various times which reduced his income.  (TR 26-27, 51-53, 69-73; 
Exhibits D, E) </P> 
 
<P>Also, he had more financial problems created when Company #2 declared bankruptcy as he was holding five checks that the bank would not honor.  (TR 53-54)</P> 
 
<P>He discussed his debts with the DSS Special Agent in full and explained the nine debts listed in the SOR as follows:</P> 
 
<UL> 
  <LI>Applicant denied that he was indebted to Creditor #1, a hospital. Company #2 was to pay for this required annual physical through his insurance, but did not 
because of their bankruptcy. He paid his part of the bill initially, and then paid the debt in March 2002.  (SOR 2.a.)  (Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; Exhibits A, C; 
TR 21-22; 24-25; 45-46)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant denied a debt to Creditor #2 for chiropractic care that was required after an injury at Company #2 which was to be paid under workman's 
compensation, but was not paid by the bankrupt company.  He paid his part of the bill initially and paid the debt in March 2002.  (SOR 2.b.) (Exhibits 2, 4, 
5; Answer; TR 46; Exhibits A, C) </LI> 
  <LI>Applicant denied a debt to Creditor #3, a credit card company.  He was injured in 1996 and had a total knee replacement.  He had insurance on the card and 
expected it to cover his debt after the injury.  When it did not, he paid this debt by transferring the amount to another credit card company.  (SOR 2.c.)  
(Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; TR 46-47)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant denied this debt as he has previously paid his debt to Creditor #4 in 1998.  They claimed they never received the check, so he paid them in full 
with a money order.  (SOR 2.d.)  (Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; TR 23, 47; Exhibit B)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant denied this debt to Creditor #5 of $773 as it was an account his wife had; he stated he settled the account with them for $400 which was to be paid 
in August 2003.  (SOR 2.e.)  (Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; TR 48, 81-82) </LI> 
  <LI>Applicant admits a debt to Creditor #6, which he also admitted in an interviewed by the DSS  Special Agent in March 2002, but said he has made 
arrangements to pay this debt in June 2003 and is now in good standing.  He is paying them $40 per month by automatic deduction from his bank.  (SOR 
2.f.)   (Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; TR 22, 48, 82-83; Exhibits A, B)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant denies a debt to Creditor #7 which he claims is his wife's account.  His wife is in charge of their finances; he has asked her to resolve this debt.  
(SOR 2.g.)  (Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; TR 43-44, 49, 83-84)</LI> 
  <LI>I accept Applicant statement that Creditor #8 is the same as Creditor #3.  (SOR 2.h.) (Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; TR 49)</LI> 
  <LI>Applicant denies a debt to Creditor #9 which occurred when he co-signed a loan for his son's car in State #2.  After the son was injured, the son fell behind 
in his car payments, so Applicant had his father drive the car to State #1; he asked for a payoff amount which Creditor #9 stated was $2,700. Applicant paid 
that amount and subsequently Creditor #9 sent him the title.  He later sold the car to an individual as he had clear title. While Creditor #9 claimed he owed 
them $1,200 additionally, Applicant insists he does not as he got clear title to the car.  (SOR 2.i.) (Exhibits 2, 4, 5; Answer; TR 49-51, 84-85; Exhibit A)</LI> 
 
 
<P>In March 2002, Applicant stated his monthly net income was $3,572, monthly expenses were $908; monthly debt payments were $1,159; he had a net 
remainder of $1,505.  His assets totaled $130,000 including real estate, bank savings, and car/boat.  (Exhibit 2; TR 85-86) In August 2003 he stated he has paid 
off the debts on all of the vehicles that the family owns and only has a mortgage payment.  (TR 78) He has not acquired any new debts.  (TR 86) His assets 
include a home on six acres, a motorcycle, two cars, a 1996 pickup, a 1937 pickup (worth $30-40,000), two boats and outboard engines, and three farm tractors.  
He is attempting to sell several of his vehicles to be debt free.  (TR 87-88; Exhibit H) Applicant now has an annual salary of over $38,000 which is a monthly 
average of over $3,000; his wive makes $300-$350 monthly as a substitute teacher.  Their monthly expenses now total close to $2,000 which leaves more than 
$1,000 monthly as a cushion.  (Exhibit H)</P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that

individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  </P>

Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>After Applicant did not reveal two past arrests and his financial difficulties on his SF 86 form, this failure to disclose led the Government to raise security 
concerns over personal conduct issues.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (2)  The deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used 
to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award 
fiduciary responsibilities.  Applicant's omission of relevant and material information about this debt could reflect questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that he may not properly safeguard classified information. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant rebutted and overcame these Government's security concerns by demonstrating  he mitigated<A HREF="02-13568.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN> this concern under Mitigating Condition (MC) 2 .  He 
credibly explained the basis for his initial beliefs that his misdemeanor arrests were not required in response to the security clearance questionnaire.   In fact, in 
his words, the 1996 incident "never rang" to his mind as it was an isolated alcohol-related arrest that was reduced to Negligent Driving. In the 1997 incident, he 
was never actually arrested; and his wife ultimately dropped the charges both in 1996 and 1997.  Further, he did not consider his financial issues were serious 
given his assets.  There is evidence in the DSS statement that Applicant fully cooperated with the agent after he was questioned about his past arrests and 
financial difficulties and provided the requested information voluntarily.  Hence, Applicant met MC 2:  the falsification was an isolated incident, and he has 
subsequently provided correct information voluntarily. Further, supervisors and co-workers from his employers, both past and present, view Applicant generally 
as a person of integrity and honesty.  After looking at the whole person and considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule 
for Applicant on subparagraph 1.a.. through 1.c. under SOR Paragraph 1.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>While Applicant has had under DC (1) a history of financial problems and showed (3) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy all of his debts, he has made 
substantial efforts to resolve these debts as detailed in the Findings of Facts either by paying the debts,  working out a plan with the debtor (SOR 2.f.), or 
effectively contesting the debt (SOR 2.i.).  Applicant has a good income with sufficient reserves to handle his financial obligations and has substantial assets.  
Applicant effectively mitigated<A HREF="02-13568.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> his debts as alleged in SOR 2.a. through 2.i.  under MC  3 (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the 
person's control, for example loss of employment and unexpected medical emergency, or separation) and MC 6 (a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts) apply.   Applicant had substantial medical problems that led to periods of unemployment and also worked for Company #2 which 
declared bankruptcy; all these factors contributed to his adverse financial situation.  Once alerted to security concerns over these debts, Applicant promptly 
initiated a good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors.  Thus, Applicant has sufficiently demonstrated he is now financially responsible as he resolved the 
debts.  Although these debts raised concerns because of their long-standing nature and his failure to resolve them more quickly, he now has substantial financial 
resources and it is unlikely these financial issues will recur. Also, a co-worker who has known him for two and one half years, describes Applicant as a 
dependable person.  He sold him a tractor on a trust loan and he paid him on time. He observed that Applicant is well liked and respected by all.  His current 
and past supervisors also attest to his trustworthiness overall.  His former supervisor concluded that Applicant could "be trusted in any situation at any time, in 
any position."  His current supervisor observed that Applicant is "very dedicated to his job and is very focused in the performance of his duties."  He assessed 
Applicant as honest and trustworthy with good leadership qualities.  "He is trustworthy, reliable, shows sound judgment and uses discretion that's required for 
one in his position." </P> 
 
<P>After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under SOR Paragraph 2.  I conclude that he has 
mitigated the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.i.    </P>
