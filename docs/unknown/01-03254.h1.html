<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 5, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could 
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on August 17, 2001.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on September 25, 2001.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 5, 2001, and the case was heard 
on October 30, 2001.  The Government submitted documentary evidence, and called one witness to testify.  Testimony was taken from the 
Applicant.  The transcript was received on November 7, 2001.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's admitted past alcohol 
consumption and alleged personal conduct militate against the granting of a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> 53 years of 
age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  He is a naturalized citizen, and has lived 
in State A for the last 30 years (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 1).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.d.  The Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication from about 1968 until he last consumed alcohol in 
July of 1999 (Transcript (TR) at page at page 20 lines 14~23, and GX 2 at page 2).  His alcohol consumption was infrequent, as he would 
"usually have no more that(<EM>sic</EM>) two glasses of champagne two times yearly on special occasions" (GX 2 at page 2).  In <STRONG>September of 1993</STRONG>, 
however, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently pled guilty to, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol with at least .08% Blood Alcohol 
Content or Higher (GX 2 at page 1).  This arrest occurred in State A, and he had consumed "three beers and a Pina Colada" prior to the arrest 
(TR at page 24 line 3 to page 25 line 25).</P> 
 
<P>While on a business trip in State B in <STRONG>March of 1994</STRONG>, the Applicant was again arrested for, and subsequently found guilty of, Driving Under the 
Influence of Alcohol (TR at page 27 line 13 to page 28 line 11, and GX 3 at page 3).  He had consumed three or four beers prior to this arrest 
(TR at page 28 lines 6~11).  For the next five years, the Applicant did not consume alcohol until his next arrest in 1999 in State A (TR at page 29 
lines 16~23, and at page 30 line 18 to page 31 line 4).  In <STRONG>July of 1999</STRONG>, the Applicant was arrested for, and subsequently pled guilty to, Driving 
Under the Influence of Alcohol with at least .08% Blood Alcohol Content or Higher (GX 2 at page 2).  He was at a night club, dancing with 
friends, and had consumed about four beers (TR at page 22 lines 1~12, and GX 2 at page 2).</P> 
 
<P>As a result of his 1999 conviction, the Applicant was ordered to complete a Multiple Offender Program, and to attend 18 months of Alcoholics 
Anonymous (AA) meetings (GX 2 at page 2).  He completed the Multiple Offender Program in July of 2001, and attended more than 18 months 
of AA meetings (TR at page 33 line 13 to page 34 line 18, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) B).  The Applicant has not consumed any alcohol 
since his July 1999 arrest, has no alcohol in his home, and does not intend to consume alcohol in the future (TR at page 37 line 21 to page 39 line 
2).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E - Personal Conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>2.a.~2.c.  As stated previously, the Applicant was arrested in State A in 1993, the state where he has lived and worked for the last 30 years, and 
was also arrested while on a business trip in State B in 1994.  On <STRONG>November 3, 1994</STRONG>, the Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security 
Service (DSS) Agent.  During that <STRONG>interview</STRONG>, the DSS Agent helped the Applicant fill out his 1994 National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) (TR at 
page 59 line 18 to page 60 line 23, and AppX A).  He divulged both State A's 1993 and State B's 1994 arrest to the Agent, but the DSS Agent 
only entered the 1993 arrest on the hand written NAQ (TR at page 60 line 24 to page 61 line 11, and at page 68 line 16 to page 71 line 13).  
Eight days later on November 11, 1994, the DSS Agent returned with the typed NAQ (GX 4).  Only State A's 1993 arrest was entered, in 
answer to Question 18 regarding alcohol related arrests (GX 4 at page 4).  By the absence of State B's 1994 arrest, the Applicant assumed that 
the Government was only concerned with arrests occurring in the state where he lived and worked; and as such, he executed the <STRONG>November 11, 
1994, NAQ</STRONG> without further comment (TR at page 74 line 16 to page 76 line 11).  On <STRONG>February 13, 1995</STRONG>, the Applicant was interviewed by 
another DSS Agent (GX 3).  He disclosed the State B's arrest to the Agent during this interview, and executed a <STRONG>sworn statement</STRONG>, accordingly 
(GX 3 at page 3).</P> 
 
<P>Three years later, in <STRONG>September of 1998</STRONG>, the Applicant updated his security clearance by executing a Security Clearance Application (<STRONG>SCA</STRONG>).  He 
again did not include his State B 1994 arrest, as he was not sure the Government wanted this, already divulged, information on the SCA (TR at 
page 49 line 2 to page 50 at line 20).  Most recently, on <STRONG>January 25, 2000</STRONG>, the Applicant executed a <STRONG>sworn statement</STRONG> (GX 2).  He did not 
discuss his State B 1994 arrest, as he was not asked about it (TR at page 50 line 21 to page 52 line 16, and at page 77 line 23 to page 78 line 7).  
However, he did disclose his most recent alcohol related arrest, that occurring in State A in July of 1999 (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's immediate supervisor has known the Applicant for about four years, and characterizes the Applicant as being an extremely honest 
person (TR at page 85 line 19 to page 99 line 15).  The Applicant has never lied to the witness, not even "white lies . . . lies that don't hurt 
anybody" (TR at page 98 line 21 to page 99 line 3).  Also admitted into evidence is the Applicant's entire personnel file, AppX D, which clearly 
demonstrates that the Applicant is a valued employee.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, 
which must be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according 
to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the 
Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, 
it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to 
evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Alcohol Consumption</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Alcohol-related incidents away rom work, such as driving while under the influence . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.  The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>None.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the 
relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   c. Age of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequence involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of 
record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) which establishes doubt 
about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse 
conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or 
direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that 
the past adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all 
times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an 
applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's consumption of alcohol, he has a past history of excessive alcohol consumption as evidenced by three alcohol 
related convictions: one in 1993, one in 1994, and the last one in 1999.  However, since his last arrest, which occurred more than two years ago, 
there clearly have been positive changes in the Applicant's behavior supportive of sobriety.  He successfully completed a court ordered program, 
and attended AA meetings for more than 18 months.  He has not consumed alcohol for more than 27 months, has no alcohol in his home, and 
intends no future consumption of the intoxicant.  I therefore conclude that the Applicant's past excessive consumption is no longer of present 
security significance.  This guideline is found in favor of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The more difficult question concerns the Applicant's alleged lack of candor with the Government.  The Applicant is either telling the truth as to his 
confusion in filling out the various questionnaires, or he is lying.  I found the Applicant to be truthful during the course of his hearing, and this view is 
bolstered by the testimony of his immediate supervisor who has know the Applicant for several years.  The Applicant divulged the existence of his 
1994 State B arrest to the DSS Agent prior to signing his 1994 NAQ.  The Government was clearly aware of this arrest when he executed his 
February 1995 sworn statement.  The fact that the arrest was not later included on his 1998 SCA was not an act of deception, as the Applicant 
was still confused as to what the Government was requiring, and he had already divulged the arrest three years earlier.  The more critical question 
is did the Applicant divulge his most recent 1999 arrest.  It's existence is clearly more relevant and material to the Government's concerns.  The 
answer is "yes," the Applicant divulged it in his most recent sworn statement.  As I can find no lack of candor or dishonesty here, Guidelines E is 
also found in favor of the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his Alcohol Consumption, and alleged Personal 
Conduct.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines E and G, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has 
met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines E and G.</SPAN></P>
