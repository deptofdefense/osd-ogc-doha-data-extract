<P>On Remand.  It is found that the Department of Defense did not have jurisdiction over the Applicant when the original Decision was issued on April 23, 2003.  
That is because a valid Form 562 (Clearance Change Notification) terminating the Applicant's pending application for a security clearance was properly 
submitted to the Department of Defense on December 10, 2002.  Decision of April 23, 2002, is found null and void.  Prior Decision Vacated.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 23, 2003, I issued a Decision (Decision) in this case finding that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant the Applicant access to 
classified information.  The Applicant appealed this Decision and, on October 7, 2003, the Appeal Board of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(Appeal Board) remanded the Decision to this Administrative Judge with instructions stating that I, "(1) reopen the record to allow the parties to present 
evidence concerning the facts and circumstances of the termination of Applicant's security clearance, and (2) make a ruling as to whether Applicant's case 
should have been terminated, pursuant to Section 4.4. of the Directive [DoD Directive 5220.6], without a security clearance decision being issued."  (Appeal 
Board Decision and Remand Order (Appeal Board Decision) at 5.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Pursuant to those instructions I issued an Order Reopening Record on Remand (Order) on October 16, 2003.  The Order required the parties to meet and confer, 
and to serve on me a Joint Stipulation of Agreed Facts (Joint Stipulation).  Each party was also to prepare a Proposed Statement of Contested Facts (if any) and 
a Memorandum of Points and Authorities. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Joint Stipulation, together with nine Documentary Exhibits (Joint Stipulation Exhibits 1 through 9), was submitted to me on November 13, 2003.   Neither 
party submitted a Proposed Statement of Contested Facts.  The Applicant's counsel also prepared and submitted a Memorandum of Points and Authorities on 
November 13, 2003.  On November 17, 2003, Department Counsel submitted a letter stating that he would not be submitting a Memorandum of Points and 
Authorities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ISSUE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The issue in this case on remand is whether the Applicant's case should have been terminated, pursuant to Section 4.4. of the Directive, without a decision 
being issued.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Joint Stipulation of Agreed Facts is hereby incorporated by reference into this Decision and Order.  Based on that Joint Stipulation, the nine Joint 
Stipulation Exhibits, as well as the original case file, the following Findings of Fact are made:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. The Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application to the Defense Security Service (DSS) on March 21, 2002.  (Joint Stipulation Exhibit 1.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. A Statement of Reasons was issued concerning the Applicant on September 26, 2002.  (Joint Stipulation Exhibit 2.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3. The Applicant submitted an Answer to the Statement of Reasons on October 7, 2002, requesting a decision without a hearing.  (Joint Stipulation Exhibit 3.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4. On October 31, 2002, Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) to the Applicant.  Pursuant to Section E3.1.7 of DoD Directive 
5220.6, the Applicant had 30 days to submit information in rebuttal to the FORM.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">5. The Applicant did not respond to the FORM.  Rather, his employer decided that the Applicant no longer required a security clearance.  On December 10, 
2002, the Applicant's application for a security clearance was withdrawn by his employer using the electronic version of the DoD Form 562 (Clearance Change 
Notification).  (Joint Stipulation Exhibit 5.)  This form is used to administratively change the security clearance status of people like the Applicant.  That 
document states under section 1, "Type of Change - Administrative Termination // Effective Date - 2002/12/10 // Termination Status - Pending Clearance."  
Submission of a Form 562 to administratively terminate a clearance is not a punitive action.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">6. The Applicant confirmed that the Form 562 had been submitted electronically to DSS on December 1, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">7. The Defense Industrial Security Office (DISCO) received the Applicant's electronically filed DISCO Form 562 on or about December 10, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">8. Due to an apparent administrative error within DISCO the Applicant's Form 562 was not forwarded to DOHA (or, if forwarded, was not properly processed 
by DOHA personnel).  As such, on or about January 3, 2003, the Applicant's security clearance application was inadvertently forwarded to me for decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">9. The properly filed Form 562 was not made part of the FORM by Department Counsel.  The fact of the Applicant's administrative termination was also not 
commented on by the Department Counsel or the Applicant.  Accordingly, based on the available record, on April 23, 2003, I issued a Decision denying the 
Applicant's request for a security clearance.  The subject appeal followed.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In pertinent part, DoD Directive 5220.6 states the following:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.  <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICY</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is DoD policy that:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.4.  Actions pursuant to this Directive shall cease upon termination of the applicant's need for access to classified information except in those cases in which:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.4.1.  A hearing has commenced.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.4.2.  A clearance decision has been issued; or</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">4.4.3.  The applicant's security clearance was suspended and the applicant provided a written request that the case continue.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">ADDITIONAL PROCEDURAL GUIDANCE</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.10.  The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery and evidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly 
manner.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's need for access to classified information was terminated by his employer on December 10, 2002.  On that same date, the employer fulfilled its 
responsibilities by forwarding Form 562 to DISCO.  The parties have stipulated that DISCO received Form 562, thereby completing the employer's and the 
Applicant's responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on that proper filing, I find that the Applicant's case should have been terminated at that time because he no longer had a need for access to classified 
information as of December 10, 2002.  That is because it is DoD policy that, "Actions pursuant to this Directive <EM>shall cease upon termination of the applicant's 
need for access to classified information</EM>."  (Paragraph 4.4, Directive.) (Emphasis supplied.)  The Applicant's case does not meet any of the exceptions.  I 
specifically find that Exception 4.4.2 does not apply because Form 562 was issued before my Decision.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly, the Decision of April 23, 2003, should not have been issued because DOHA no longer had jurisdiction over the Applicant.  That Decision is null 
and void and will be vacated.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">DECISION AND ORDER</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, the security clearance Decision in this case dated April 23, 2003, is <STRONG>NULL AND VOID 
</STRONG>and hereby <STRONG>VACATED</STRONG>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Appropriate administrative action shall be taken in conformance with this Decision and Order.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>IT IS SO ORDERED</STRONG>. </SPAN></P>
