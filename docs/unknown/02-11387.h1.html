<P>In his high school, college, and post-college years, Applicant used marijuana approximately 75 to 100 times.  He also used mushrooms (psilocybin) twice while 
in college. He used marijuana while holding an interim security clearance.  Applicant did not list his drug use on his security clearance application because he

<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On April 17, 2003, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="02-11387.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="02-11387.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the 
SOR in writing on May 12, 2003, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on July 14, 2003.  On July 17, 
2003, a Notice of Hearing was issued.  On July 31, 2003, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding on August 8, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct.  Three allegations relate to conduct charged under Guideline H, Drug Involvement; two allegations 
relate to conduct charged under Guideline E, Personal Conduct; and one allegation relates to conduct charged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct.  In his 
answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all six factual allegations.  At the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not hold a security clearance in December 
2000, when he completed and signed his security clearance application (SF-86), as alleged in subparagraph 2.b. of the SOR.  Department Counsel accordingly 
requested a finding for Applicant as to allegation 2.b. of the SOR.  Applicant's admissions as to allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 2.a., and 3.a. of the SOR are 
incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 25 years old.  He graduated from high school in 1996 and from college in 2000.  Since May 2000, he has been employed as a mechanical engineer 
by a defense contractor.  A good friend and his supervisor submitted letters attesting to Applicant's reliability, maturity, and good character. (Ex. A; Ex. B.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant used mushrooms<A HREF="02-11387.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> (psilocybin) twice in 1996 and 1997. He used marijuana 75 to 100 times during the period from 1994 to the summer of 2001.  
Applicant began using marijuana in social settings in 1994, while he was a high school student.  His use of the drug became more extensive from May 1996 to 
September 1999.  He continued to use marijuana with less frequency until the mid-summer of 2001.  Applicant contributed money to purchase the marijuana he 
used.  (Ex. 3, at 2. )</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was granted an interim security clearance on or about January 5, 2001, and he was notified of the grant of interim clearance sometime thereafter by 
his employer.  (Tr. 18-19.) Applicant used marijuana in the mid-summer of 2001, while holding an interim security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant completed, signed, and certified a security clearance application (SF-86) on December 5, 2000.  Question 27 on the SF-86 reads as follows: "Since 
the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, 
hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.,) hallucinogenics (LSD, 
PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?"  Applicant responded "no" to Question 27.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">One year later, in December 2001, Applicant was interviewed by an agent of the Defense Investigative Service, and, in a signed, sworn statement, he admitted 
his use of marijuana and mushrooms (psilocybin) and supplied details of his drug use.  He stated that he falsified his answer to Question 27 on his SF-86 
because he did not want his employer to learn of his drug use. (Ex. 3, at 3.)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In 
evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  The 
decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely an 
indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H, Drug Involvement</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H that Applicant had used marijuana 75 to 100 times between the end of 1994 and the mid-summer of 2001 (&para; 
1.a.); that he used marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance (&para; 1.b.); and that he used mushrooms (psilocybin) twice in 1996 and 1997 (&para; 1.c.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's concern with Guideline H conduct is that it raises questions regarding an individual's willingness to protect classified information.  Drug 
abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, thereby increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information.  &para; 
E2.A8.1.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Drugs are defined under Guideline H as mood and behavior-altering substances, including drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed 
in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, and inhalants and other similar substances. &para;&para; E2.A8.1.1.2., E2.A8.1.1.2.1., E2.A8.1.1.2.2.  Drug abuse 
is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.  &para; E2.A8.1.1.3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Through Applicant's own admissions, the Government established a <EM>prima facie</EM> case that he used and purchased illegal drugs and used an illegal drug after 
being granted an interim security clearance.  Applicant has admitted Guideline H drug involvement specified in the SOR and identified as disqualifying under 
&para;&para; E2.A8.1.2.1., E2.A8.1.2.2., and E2.A8.1.2.5. of Guideline H.<A HREF="02-11387.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record shows that Applicant's involvement with illegal drugs, which lasted seven years, ended a little more than 2&frac12; years ago, in mid-summer 2001.  His 
drug involvement, thus, is recent and neither isolated nor aberrational.  Accordingly, mitigating conditions E2.A8.1.3.1 and E2.A8.1.3.2. do not apply.  In his 
signed, sworn statement and at his hearing, Applicant stated that he had no intention of using drugs in the future.  (Ex. 3, at 3: Tr. 21-22.)  I find his statement 
credible when weighed with his testimony and demeanor at his hearing, and I conclude that mitigating condition E2.A8.1.3.3 applies to Applicant's Guideline 
H conduct.  However, despite the applicability of this one mitigating condition, Applicant presents insufficient evidence to rebut or mitigate the disqualifying 
conduct under Guideline H which he has admitted to.  Accordingly, the allegations in the SOR of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H are concluded 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged that Applicant's illegal drug use, as specified in subparagraph 2.a., raised security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct.  
Guideline E conduct, which involves questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations, could indicate that an applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conceding that the allegations in subparagraph 2.b. of the SOR were not based upon the record evidence, the Government requested that subparagraph 2.b. be 
concluded for the Applicant.  Applicant accurately and adequately demonstrated that he did not hold a security clearance at the time he completed and signed 
his SF-86 in December 2000.  Accordingly, allegation 2.b. is concluded for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to the Guideline E conduct alleged in SOR subparagraph 2.a., the Government has established its case.  In subparagraph 2.a., the Government 
alleged that, in executing his response to Question 27 on the SF-86, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the drug use identified in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 
and 1.c. of the SOR.  Applicant's failure to answer question 27 completely, truthfully, and correctly raises a security concern under &para; E2.A8.1.2.2. of Guideline 
E.  In his testimony, Applicant stated that he knew his answer to Question 27 was not complete and correct and he had lied.  (Tr.31.)  He said he was afraid to 
answer the question correctly because he was embarrassed and didn't want his employer or those associated with his employer to read his SF-86 and find out 
that he had used illegal drugs.  ( Ex. 3, at 3.)  His concealment of information he considered embarrassing could make him vulnerable to coercion and 
blackmail. &para; E2.A5.1.2.4.  His conduct raises additional concerns under &para; E2.A5.1.2.5 because it suggests a pattern of dishonesty or rule violation.  Applicant's 
reticence to reveal the truth about his conduct suggests that, under some circumstances, he may put his interests before those of the Government.  It is well 
established that embarrassment is not a mitigating condition under the Directive.  ISCR Case No. 99-0557 at 3 (App. Bd. July 10, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating condition E2.A5.1.3.1 does not apply to the facts of this case: the information withheld by Applicant is pertinent to a determination of his judgment, 
trustworthiness, and reliability.  Only one other mitigating condition under Guideline E might be applicable to the instant case.  The security concern raised by 
Applicant's disqualifying conduct could be mitigated if the falsification was an isolated incident, was not recent, and if the Applicant subsequently provided the 
correct information voluntarily. &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  While Applicant supplied the correct information when questioned by a special agent of the Defense 
Investigative Service one year after he completed his SF-86, the falsifications were not isolated incidents and they are recent.  Accordingly, allegations in 
subparagraph 2.a. of the SOR are concluded against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J, Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged in &para; 3.a. under Guideline J that Applicant demonstrated a history or pattern of criminal activity by deliberately lying about his drug 
use in his response to Question 27 on his SF-86.  When he completed his SF-86, Applicant signed his name below the following statement:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">CERTIFICATION BY PERSON COMPLETING FORM</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">My statement on this form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete and correct to the  best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I 
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both (See section 1001 of title 18, United States 
Code).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under section 1001 of title 18 of the United States Code, it is a felony crime to make a knowing and willful false statement on the SF-86.  Applicant has 
admitted the conduct alleged in subparagraph 3.a. of the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concern under Guideline J is that an individual's history or pattern of criminal activity raises doubts about his judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based upon trust and confidence.  
Where the facts proven by the Government or admitted by the applicant raise doubts about the applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant 
has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nevertheless security worthy.  Applicant's knowing and willful false statement constitutes 
disqualifying conduct under &para; E2.A10.1.2.2. of Guideline J.  None of the Guideline J mitigating factors apply, and allegation 3.a of the SOR is concluded 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
