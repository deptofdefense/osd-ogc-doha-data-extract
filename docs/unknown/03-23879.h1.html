<P>Applicant failed to mitigate allegations of financial considerations relating to delinquent debts exceeding $40,000.00 including two judgments for small debts. 
He also failed to mitigate personal conduct allegations relating to failure to report these debts on his SF 86 offering only the excuse that he had forgotten about 
some since they were over six years old. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 1, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, </EM>as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>In a sworn written statement dated March 17, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on May 31, 2005. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant submitted no additional information and the case was assigned to me on July 19, 2005.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He admitted all but one of the allegations concerning financial considerations and admitted the 
allegations relating to personal conduct. He offered some explanatory information about the allegations and stated an intent to pay most of them in monthly 
payments. After a complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings 
of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant has delinquent debts to which he admits of slightly exceeding $40,000.00 of which approximately $37,000.00 are for three hospital and doctor's bills 
(SOR 1.f., g., and k.). One of the debts resulted in a judgment for over $6,000.00 (SOR 1.k.). The remaining four are for a few hundred dollars each but two of 
them resulted in judgments being entered against Applicant (SOR 1.e. and i.). Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996 and for Chapter 13 in 1999, and 
the debts extant at that time were discharged in both proceedings. In his investigative statements in 2003, he indicated that he intends to pay sum certain 
amounts on admitted debts. He entered into one payment agreement (FORM Item 11) which is in evidence but no proof of payment on any of the debts was 
submitted. The one allegation denied by Applicant was denied only because the mortgage debt has been transferred to another creditor. He does not intend to 
file for bankruptcy again.</P> 
<P>Applicant admitted making false statements in 1996 causing a company he owned to be paid  over $6,500.00 in government funds to which he was not entitled. 
The U.S. Attorney in his state declined to prosecute. </P> 
<P>Applicant failed to acknowledge the delinquent debts and unpaid judgments on his application for security clearance (SF 86) at Questions 37, 38, and 39 filed in 
2002. His excuse for not reporting the debts was that he had forgotten most of them as some were over six years old. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence</P> 
<P>of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential</P> 
<P>for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only 
when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's delinquent debts prompted the allegation in the SOR of violation of Guideline F in that an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of 
having to engage in illegal acts</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">to generate funds. (E2.A6.1.1.) Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include a history of not meeting financial obligations 
(E2.A6.1.2.1.) and evidence of</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts. (E2.A6.1.2.3.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigating Conditions (MC) might  include the fact that the person has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts 
(E2.A6.1.3.6.), and that the conditions resulting in the problems were largely beyond the person's control (E2.A6.1.3.3.) The assertion in his answer that he 
intended to pay the debts without any proof of having even begun to do so is insufficient to provide grounds for application of mitigating conditions under 
Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's conduct regarding the receipt of government funds to which he was not entitled raises concerns under E2.A2.1.2.2. regarding deceptive or illegal 
financial practices and other financial breaches of trust. Applicant admitted making false statements to secure the funds. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also alleged under Guideline E is Applicant's failure to acknowledge the judgments and delinquent debts in response to relevant questions on his SF 86 
indicates questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly 
safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). His conduct falls under E2.A5.1.2.2 regarding the deliberate omission of relevant and material facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire . No mitigating conditions are applicable since his only excuse for the omissions was that he forgot about the debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant clearance to Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
