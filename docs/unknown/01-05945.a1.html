  The Administrative Judge articulated a rational basis, supported by the record evidence, for his rejection of Applicant's denials that she owed delinquent debts.  The Judge's findings about Applicant's delinquent debts provided a rational basis for his application of Financial Considerations  Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 3.  The Judge's findings and conclusions about Applicant's delinquent debts provided a rational basis for his security clearance  decision.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>Administrative Judge John R. Erck issued a decision, dated May 22, 2002, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.</P> 
<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended.</P> 
<P>Applicant's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant had various delinquent debts; (2) whether the 
Administrative Judge erred by applying Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 3; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge's adverse 
decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated October 5, 2001.  The SOR was based on Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations).  A File of Relevant Material (FORM) was prepared.  A copy of the FORM was provided to Applicant.  After Applicant submitted a 
response to the FORM, the case was assigned to the Administrative Judge for determination.  The Administrative Judge issued a decision, dated May 22, 2002, 
in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board 
on Applicant's appeal from the Judge's adverse decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See, e.g.,</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 
2-3 (discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence.  In making this review, 
the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 
E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly 
detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0205 (October 19, 2000) at p. 2.</P> 
<P>When a challenge to an Administrative Judge's rulings or conclusions raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 
87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing federal cases).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant had various delinquent debts</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant had satisfied the 
debts covered by SOR paragraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, and entered formal findings in favor of Applicant with respect to those five debts.  The Judge also 
found that the debts covered by SOR paragraphs 1.g and 1.h were  the same debt, and entered a formal finding in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR 
paragraph 1.h based on that finding.  The Judge's findings and conclusions about SOR paragraphs 1.a through 1.e and 1.h are not at issue on appeal.  However, 
Applicant challenges the Judge's findings that she owed delinquent debts as alleged in SOR paragraphs 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k.</P> 
<P>On appeal, Applicant states: (a) she is trying to clear up discrepancies about her finances that appear in her security clearance application and her statement to a 
Defense Security Service investigator; (b) she has been honest and forthright with the government about her financial problems and has not tried to mislead 
anyone about them; (c) "I can't explain the reason for the confusion [about my finances] in either of my application forms, but I can assure you that no 
malicious attempts to deceive anyone were intended"; (d) although she has been forthcoming about her delinquent debts, she did not intend to admit any 
delinquent debts that were not incurred by her; and (e) she has gone to great lengths to clear from her credit report debts that were not hers.  The Board 
construes Applicant's statements as raising the issue whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding that she had delinquent debts as alleged in SOR 
paragraphs 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k.</P> 
<P>To the extent Applicant refers to having succeeded in getting credit reporting agencies to remove debts from her credit report, Applicant is presenting new 
evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  Applicant had an opportunity to present information for consideration by the Administrative Judge in 
response to the FORM.  Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and submitted a response to the FORM.  Applicant cannot fairly claim the Judge made 
erroneous factual findings based on her referring to evidence that was not presented for the Judge to consider.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge specifically noted Applicant's denials that she owed delinquent debts as alleged in SOR paragraphs 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k and 
explained why he did not accept Applicant's denials.  Specifically, the Judge decided to accept Applicant's admissions of various delinquent debts that appear 
in her security clearance application (FORM, Item 4) and her October 19, 2000 written statement (FORM, Item 5) and reject her later denial of those debts 
(Applicant's answer to SOR; Applicant's response to FORM).  The Judge's reasoning was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Considering the record 
evidence as a whole, the Judge's challenged findings are sustainable.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.</P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 3</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge applied Financial 
Considerations Disqualifying Conditions 1 and 3 to the delinquent debts he found Applicant owed.  Applicant contends the Judge erred by applying those two 
Disqualifying Conditions.</P> 
<P>Applicant argues the Administrative Judge erred by applying Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition 1<A HREF="01-05945.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> because  she does not owe those delinquent 
debts, and her mistaken admission of those debts is not proof that she has excessive debts.  As discussed earlier in this decision, the Board has sustained the 
Judge's findings that Applicant had delinquent debts as alleged in SOR paragraphs 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k.  Given those findings, the Judge had a rational basis 
for applying Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition 1.</P> 
<P>Applicant argues the Administrative Judge erred by applying Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition 3<A HREF="01-05945.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> because he accepted Applicant's evidence 
that she had satisfied various  delinquent debts (<EM>i.e.</EM>, the debts covered by SOR paragraphs 1.a through 1.e).  Applicant's argument does not demonstrate the 
Judge erred.  The Judge's sustainable findings about Applicant's delinquent debts provide a rational basis for the Judge's application of Financial 
Considerations Disqualifying Condition 3.</P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law</SPAN>.  In addition to Applicant's specific claims of error by the 
Administrative Judge, Applicant  asserts: (a) she does not try to live beyond her means and is not financially overextended; and (b) she has paid her taxes and 
always has paid her debts and honored her obligations to the best of her ability.  The Board construes these statements as raising the issue of whether the 
Judge's adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>The federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in persons granted access to classified information.  <EM>Snepp v. United 
States</EM>, 444 U.S. 507, 511 n.6 (1980).  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information 
before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  In this 
case, the Judge's findings of fact about Applicant's unresolved delinquent debts provide a rational basis for the Judge's adverse conclusions about her security 
eligibility.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0454 (February 7, 1997) at pp. 2-3 (discussing security significance of history of excessive indebtedness or recurring 
financial difficulties).  Accordingly, the Judge's adverse security clearance decision is not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>
