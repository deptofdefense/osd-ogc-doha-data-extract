<P>Applicant is 34 years old, married with two children, and works for a defense contractor as a calibration technician.  He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001.  He 
incurred two debts subsequently that he successfully paid in full by February 2004.  A third debt may not be his debt, and he is attempting to pay it or dispute it.  
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concern.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On June 10, 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-13992.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  Applicant answered 
the SOR in writing on July 26, 2004 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2004.  On 
November 29, 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant.  The Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December 
7, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 34 years old, married, a veteran, and now works for a defense contractor as a calibration technician.  He has two children.  His take home income is 
about $30,000 annually.  He has $40 to $60 remaining every month from his income after his monthly bills are paid. (Tr. 16, 18, 85; Exhibits 1 and 6)</P> 
<P>Applicant served 10 years in the Air Force.  When he got off active duty in 1998 and had to live on the economy like all civilians, he found it difficult to 
manage his finances.  He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2001 to rid himself of the delinquent debts he accumulated in three years, and especially to have 
the electricity turned on again.  Applicant had an electric bill for $1,670 that he could not pay.  Applicant was discharged in bankruptcy on December 3, 2001.  
Before his bankruptcy, and even until the present day, Applicant paid at least the minimum amount on his debts.  Applicant does not have a checking account, 
but does have a savings account and a 401k account.  Applicant's wife takes care of the monthly finances for the family now. (Tr. 18-21, 30, 50, 66; Exhibit 6)</P> 
<P>The telephone bill delinquent debt alleged in SOR paragraph 1.a. arose because Applicant's wife was calling her family overseas and the rates were high.  The 
debt is paid as of October 2003.  The family now uses prepaid long-distance telephone calling cards. (Tr. 21; Exhibit C)</P> 
<P>The automobile delinquent debt alleged in SOR paragraph 1.b. was for an auto Applicant bought while stationed in Europe.  The creditor told him it would send 
him a payment book to continue payments after Applicant separated from the Air Force and had to stop his allotment.  The creditor never sent the booklet, and 
Applicant could not locate anyone to whom to make payments.  The debt is now paid and the lien released.  The final payment was made in February 2004. (Tr. 
21-23; Exhibit D)</P> 
<P>The financial services debt alleged in SOR paragraph 1.c. is a mystery to Applicant.  He made several efforts in 2004 to contact the creditor, but has not been 
able to establish a contact to arrange an installment payment plan.  Applicant does not know how to contest or dispute the debt through the credit reporting 
agencies.  Applicant does not know the origin of this debt.  The credit report that is Exhibit 4 shows that creditor is an assignee of a bank debt, and I conclude 
that debt is from a credit card. (Tr. 23, 40; Exhibits 3-5)</P> 
<P>Applicant is current on all his bills at present.  He has three credit cards and is making payments on them.  His credit card payments are the minimum amount 
and he has not been able to pay off any of the cards yet.  His total debt for those is about $700.  His wife sends $200 every other month to help support her 
unemployed brothers overseas.  That money in one year would have paid off the credit card debts on which Applicant makes the minimum payments, so 
Applicant does earn sufficient funds to pay his debts and save some money.  Applicant owes about $11,000 on a used automobile he bought, on which he pays 
$278 monthly, which amount and debt is common in the U.S. for an automobile.  Applicant appeared to be a poor money manager and struggling to pay his 
current expenses, and it able to do so barely every month. (Tr. 27-90; Exhibits 3-5)</P> 
<P>Applicant has a good work record.  He is competent and provides a quality work product. (Exhibits A and B)</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding 
Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified 
information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified 
information.  ISCR Case No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by 
substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the 
ultimate burden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 
(App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national 
security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  "[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 
12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F:Financial Considerations: <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant had three delinquent debts.  He 
filed for and was discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 to relieve himself of earlier debts.  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) E2.A6.1.2.1 (<EM>a history of not 
meeting financial obligations</EM>) and DC E2.A6.1.2.3 (<EM>inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply.  Applicant's financial statement of January 20, 2004, 
showed he did not have enough income to pay these debts in addition to the debts already listed.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant paid the debts listed in the first two paragraphs of the SOR, and did so before and immediately after January 20, 2004.  Therefore, those debts are not 
a factor.  The third SOR debt is not a debt Applicant recognizes because his credit card grantor turned the debt over to a collection agency.  Applicant 
committed to pay that debt on an installment payment account.  If not valid, he would dispute it, seeking its removal from his credit report.  Applicant is 
unsophisticated about financial management, and surrendered the family finances to his wife after they filed bankruptcy in 2001.  However, through all of 
Applicant's financial difficulties, it is clear he has made an effort to pay something, usually the minimum amount or an amount reasonable under his income, on 
each debt.  He has not ignored an obligation.  The bankruptcy in 2001 was a reasonable and legal method to resolve his delinquent debts.  Applicant finds 
himself in the same situation many people do of only being able to live from paycheck to paycheck and get by financially.  Outside of his car debt, his debts are 
not large, being less than $2,000.  Therefore, I conclude he initiated and maintains good-faith efforts to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his 
debts, so that Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A6.1.3.6 (<EM>the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM>) 
applies. </SPAN></P>
