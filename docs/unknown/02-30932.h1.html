<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old security guard supervisor who works for a defense contractor. He has had four traffic arrests relating to alcohol between 1971 and 
2003. He had no incidents from 1998 until 1993. Applicant failed to report any of the offenses on his 2002 application for a security clearance (SF 86). 
However, he did report the 1998 incident in response to Question 24 on an SF 86 he filed in 2000. His failure to do so was not deliberate but his pattern of 
conduct regarding alcohol and driving over a 30 year period warrants denial. Clearance is denied.  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P> </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On April 27, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On May 11, 2004, Applicant, in a sworn written statement, responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned 
to me on August 18, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on October 14, 2004, and a hearing was held on November 4, 2004. The Government introduced six 
exhibits and the Applicant introduced six exhibits. All were admitted into evidence. The Applicant testified. The transcript was received on November 22, 
2004.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted all of the specific allegations in the SOR relating to alcohol but denied those relating to personal conduct. After a complete review of the 
evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record the following additional findings of fact are made:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old security guard supervisor who works for a defense contractor. He was on active duty in the army until April 2002, when he retired 
after 20 years of service. He has had four driving offenses relating to alcohol beginning in 1971 when he was charged with DUI, pled guilty, and his license was 
suspended for one year. A second arrest for DUI in 1984 or 1985 resulted in a plea of guilty with a fine and suspension of license for another year. . His next 
arrest was in 1994 and the charge was dismissed. In 1998 he was charged under Article 15 with drunken driving and going the wrong way on a one way street. 
He was reprimanded and his collateral access was suspended. He had no further arrests until the most recent one in 2003 when he was charged with impaired 
driving, found guilty, and his driver's license restricted for one year.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG>Applicant failed to report any of the offenses on his application for a security clearance (SF 86) in response to Question 24 concerning alcohol offenses, and 
Question 25 concerning military court proceedings filed in 2002 (Exh. 1). However, he did report the 1998 incident in response to Question 24 on an SF 86 he 
filed in 2000 and introduced in evidence (Exh. F). <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's 2003 arrest occurred when he drove 50 miles at 11 p.m. after getting off an evening shift to celebrate a new job for a friend who had been hired by 
Applicant's employer. He returned home several hours later and was arrested while driving through the military base where he works about three miles from his 
home. His test for blood alcohol was .16 and .08 is considered intoxicated. He was charged with impaired driving and his driver's license was restricted for one 
year. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is well regarded by his employer and is under consideration for a promotion to supervisor. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has cited a Disqualifying Condition (DC) pursuant to the Directive concerning alcohol under Guideline G. This relates to excessive alcohol 
consumption (E2.A7.1.1) and alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence. (E2.A7.1.2.2.) Possible mitigating factors 
include the fact that the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no current problem (E2.A7.1.3.2.), or that there have been positive changes in 
behavior supportive of sobriety. (E2.A7.1.3.3.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The record of Applicant's offenses, convictions, and sentences establish the DC has been met. Mitigating Conditions might be applicable in that most of the 
arrests occurred over seven years ago. However, the most recent one occurred less than two years ago. Applicant stated at the hearing that he learned his lesson 
in 1971 and reduced his drinking. The record since then belies his contention and shows a disqualifying pattern of conduct. The DOHA Appeal Board has found 
that six alcohol related offenses over 23 years was sufficient to establish a pattern. ISCR Case No. 01-22403 (App. Bd. September 5, 2002). While it might be 
argued that five arrests over a 33 year period are insufficient to establish a pattern, the recency of the last arrest and the facts surrounding it leads me to conclude 
that a pattern exists. No mitigating conditions are applicable to the facts in this matter.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, of the Directive involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules 
and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) The Government has established by evidence that 
he has been involved in a pattern of rule violations (E2.A5.1.2.5.) and failure to give complete and accurate information on his SF 86. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant testified he believed his 2002 SF 86 needed only to be updated from his last one and that one in 2000 had reported the 1998 incident and arrest. The 
2003 arrest occurred after both had been submitted. He also testified that his prior SF 86s had been done under the supervision of a security officer and that he 
lacked that help when filing his 2002 application. I find that he did not deliberately withhold information on his 2002 application as the guideline requires. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude Applicant is not a trustworthy 
and reliable person whose record of conduct justifies a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to him. While 
his lack of criminal conduct and alcohol related offenses for five years between 1998 and 2003 may be commendable, he has shown in 2003 a reversion to a 
pattern of alcoholic problems that have persisted for over 30 years. It is premature to grant a clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1. Guideline G:  AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
