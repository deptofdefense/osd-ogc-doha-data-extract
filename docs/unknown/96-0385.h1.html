  Applicant had used marijuana with varying frequency for more than 10 years; he had used it most frequently two months before his Administrative Hearing.  While serving in the U.S.  Navy, he had received an Article 15, UCMJ, for trafficking in LSD and was subsequently  discharged from the Navy --- for the same misconduct --- before the term of his enlistment had  expired.  When he completed his NAQ in 1994, he withheld information about the Article 15,  and admitted that he had smoked marijuana on only one occasion in 1986.  During the first DIS  interview, he admitted the circumstances of his discharge from the Navy, but denied again all  marijuana use except for the single occasion in 1986.  He finally admitted the full extent of his  marijuana use during the second DIS interview incident to a polygraph examination.  Clearance  is denied.</P>

<P>	On June 13, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February 20,
1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, "<EM>Defense Industrial
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as amended by
Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Michael Stephen
Walker (Applicant) which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination
that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
him.  </P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.                
    </P>

<P>	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on July 16, 1996, and requested a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on July
26, 1996.  A hearing was convened on August 22, 1996 for the purpose of considering whether it
would be clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's
security clearance. The government's case consisted of twelve exhibits and no witnesses; Applicant
relied on two exhibits<A HREF="96-0385.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> and on his testimony.  Transcripts of the proceedings were received on
September 4 and September 30, 1996<A HREF="96-0385.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>Applicant has denied, with explanation, the factual allegations set forth under subparagraphs
a., b., c., e., f., i., and l. of paragraph 1 (Criterion H).  He has admitted, with explanation, the factual
allegations set forth under subparagraphs d., h., j., k., m, and n. of paragraph 1.  With respect to
paragraph 2 (Criterion E), Applicant has denied the principal Criterion E allegation, but has
admitted, with explanation, the factual allegations set forth under subparagraphs a., b., c., and d. 
Likewise with respect to paragraph 3 (Criterion J), Applicant has denied the principal Criterion J
allegation, but has admitted with explanation, the factual allegation set forth under subparagraph a. </P>

<P>	I have accepted Applicant's admissions and incorporate them as part of my findings of fact. </P>

<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of
the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.<U><STRONG></STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>Applicant is a 28 year old employee of a defense contractor.  He has been employed by his
current employer for four years and is applying for a secret clearance.  Applicant had previously held
a secret clearance while serving in the U.S. Navy.  Applicant's current suitability for a security 
clearance has been referred to an Administrative Judge because of drug abuse and falsification.</P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>Applicant's use of drugs began with cocaine when he was 16 years old. He first used cocaine
with three friends in 1984 when he was a freshman in high school.<A HREF="96-0385.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  After his initial use, he used
cocaine occasionally from 1985 to 1987.  He estimates that he used it a couple of times after 1987
at parties, but has not used it since December 1989.  On two or three occasions during the 1985 to
1987 time frame, Applicant contributed money toward the purchase of cocaine.  He denies that he
ever purchased it directly from a dealer.</P>

<P>	Applicant first used marijuana in March 1985.  From that date until he graduated from high
school in 1987, he used it as often as weekly.  From 1987 until June 1996, Applicant continued to
used marijuana occasionally<A HREF="96-0385.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> on weekends.  He used marijuana most recently on June 23, 1996. 
During the time that Applicant was using marijuana, he was also purchasing it.  He purchased
marijuana most regularly and most frequently from 1985 to 1987.  On one occasion in 1986, he and
a friend purchased a quantity of marijuana and sold it for a profit (Tr. 81).  He continued to
purchased it after that date in varying amounts with varying degrees of frequency.  He had purchased
$20.00 worth in 1996 up to the time he answered the SOR.</P>

<P>	In addition to cocaine and marijuana. Applicant also used other illegal substances. He used
crank (methamphetamine) weekly in 1985-86, hashish once in 1986, and magic (hallucinogenic)
mushrooms three times in 1987.</P>

<P>	On August 30, 1991, Applicant was discharged from the U.S. Navy before the term of his
enlistment had expired for "MISCONDUCT - DRUG ABUSE" (Govt. Exh 8).  He was given a
General Discharge under Honorable Conditions.  Previously Appellant had received punishment
under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for wrongful possession and distribution
of LSD.  While Applicant has admitted that he used LSD twice and purchased it once, he has
consistently denied that he has ever sold or distributed LSD.</P>

<P><U><STRONG></STRONG></U>	When Applicant completed his National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) on October 25, 1994,
he certified that:</P>

<P>	.....the entries made by be are true, complete and accurate to the best of my
knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing an
willful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.</P>

<P>In response to question 18.a. which asked if he had ever been arrested, Applicant was required to list
all arrests, including non-judicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ or Captain's Mast.  Applicant
answered "YES" to this question and listed a single arrest for "Trespassing/Fireworks" on July 4,
1990. </P>

<P>	In response to question 20.a. which asked Applicant if he had ever used or possessed
marijuana or other drugs, he answered "YES" with the following explanation: </P>

<P>	Cannabis - 1986 last date used.</P>

<P>He answered "NO" to question 20.b. which asked if he had ever been involved in the illegal purchase
or sale of any illegal drugs to include marijuana.  During his first interview with the Defense
Investigative Service (DIS) in January 1996, Applicant acknowledged that he had been discharged
from the U.S. Navy "for trafficking and use of marijuana and LSD." (Govt Exh 2).  However, he
denied that he had ever purchased or sold illegal drugs and he continued to deny any and all
involvement with marijuana and other illegal drugs except for a one time use of marijuana in 1986.</P>

<P>	Later during his second DIS interview in April of 1996, Applicant admitted that he had used
marijuana and other illegal substances.  He admitted that he had first used marijuana in 1984, and
then admitted that he had used it weekly between 1986 and 1989.   He stated that he used marijuana
only a couple of times while in the U.S. Navy between 1989 and 1991, but began to use it more
regularly after discharge.  He admitted that he had used marijuana once every two or three months
after discharge and that he had continued to use it at that rate up to the present time.  He told the DIS
Special Agent that he had last used marijuana the weekend before the interview. </P>

<P>	When he answered the SOR,  Applicant admitted that he had used marijuana one more time 
on June 23, 1996.  At his administrative hearing, Applicant confirmed that June 23, 1996 was the
last date that he had used marijuana.  He began seeing a counselor shortly after that date,  and does
not intend to use marijuana in the future.</P>

<P>	Applicant has been a diligent and conscientious employee in every work environment he has
been placed.  He had that reputation when he worked in a ---------- as a high school student and has
consistently displayed the same work ethic in subsequent work environments.  While in the U.S.
Navy, he earned a reputation as an above average sailor who consistently performed above and
beyond the requirements of his rating.  In his current capacity as an employee of a defense
contractor, Applicant has been given very high marks for his technical skills, productivity and
professionalism.  In the performance appraisal which he received in August 1995, Applicant was
rated "above expected" in every performance rating category. He was promoted most recently on
October 30, 1995.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>PROCEDURAL RULING</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	At the conclusion of Applicant's testimony, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR
to allege marijuana abuse until June 23, 1996, in conformance with Applicant admissions (Tr. 101-102). Motion was granted. </P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>POLICIES</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward
making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the interests of
national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations Administrative Judges
must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only
with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context of the factors set forth in
section F.3. of the Directive as well.  Deviations from these guidelines should not frequently be
made and must be carefully explained and documented.  In that vein, the government not only has
the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it also must demonstrate that the
facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</P>

<P>	<CENTER><U><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P><U>	</U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement
of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant
to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates the
disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
or continue his security clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgement, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in Department of <EM>Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against an applicant.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P><STRONG><U>	</STRONG></U>Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria H, E, and J.</P>

<P>	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion H.  Applicant has used
marijuana with varying frequency-- as often as weekly--for almost twelve years.  During this time,
he has also used cocaine, crank, hashish and LSD.  As a member of the U.S. Navy, Applicant used
marijuana after he had been granted a security clearance.  More recently, he continued to use
marijuana  <STRONG>after</STRONG> his previous use had cause him to lie--and deny that use--when he completed his
NAQ in October 1994.  And Applicant used marijuana again after he had lied to the DIS during the
first interview in January 1996.  Finally, he used marijuana yet again after he had told the DIS during
the second interview in April 1996 that he did not intend to use it in the future.</P>

<P>	Applicant's abuse of illegal drugs other than marijuana is mitigated by the passage of time
and his stated intention not to use these substances in the future. Favorable consideration has also
been given to Applicant's outstanding work record as a member of the U.S. Navy and in his current
employment for a DoD contractor.  However, Applicant has failed to overcome or mitigate the
Government's case with respect to his abuse of marijuana.  He has abused marijuana as recently as
June 1996 - only two months before his administrative hearing.   Applicant's testimony that he does
not intend to use marijuana in the future must be weighed against his recent contradictory statements
and action.  In addition to using marijuana on June 23, 1996, as recently as July 16, 1996, Applicant
admitted -- in his answer to the SOR-- that he may use marijuana in the future if it was offered to
him at the right time.  Notwithstanding this evidence, Applicant now appears to be motivated to stop
using marijuana; he is receiving professional counseling, he has developed other interests, and his
girlfriend has become much less tolerant of his marijuana abuse (Tr. 95).  His testimony that he does
not intend to use marijuana in the future is credible, however, because of his recent marijuana abuse,
and his testimony describing a near compulsion to use marijuana (Tr. 67,68 &amp; 77), more time is
needed to satisfy this Administrative Judge that Applicant will actually succeed in terminating his
long-term relationship with marijuana.  Accordingly, allegations a., b., and d. of Criterion H are
concluded against Applicant.</P>

<P>	Criterion E applies to "the deliberate omission...of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire...or deliberately providing false and misleading information..to an
investigator in connection with a personnel security...determination."  Facts are considered relevant
and material when they are capable of influencing a federal's agency's decision, e.g., a decision to
grant or deny a security clearance.  In this instance Applicant's receipt of an Article 15 for
possession and distribution of LSD as a member of the U.S. Navy falls well within the definition of
materiality.  Also falling within the definition of materiality, and also omitted from his NAQ, and
from his first signed, sworn statement, are Applicant's abuse of marijuana-- as often as weekly--
during the past eleven years, and his abuse of other illegal substances during the same time frame. 
It is critical that Applicant failed to disclose information about his Article 15 and substance abuse
on his NAQ under circumstances where he was obviously acting willfully and deliberately.  He
testified that he felt "shame and fear" about the Article 15, and knew that his security clearance
application would be rejected if he included that information (Tr. 65-66).  Applicant clearly knew
that he had smoked marijuana more than once in 1986 as he had stated on his NAQ, and during his
first DIS interview.</P>

<P>	Because Applicant had provided this misinformation on two occasions -- in October 1994
and January 1996; this misconduct was neither an isolated incident, nor was it misconduct far
removed from the present.  Although Applicant finally admitted the full extent of his marijuana and
other drugs abuse during the DIS interview in April 1996, he did not make these admissions under
circumstances where he can be credited with making a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his prior
falsification.  Allegations a., b., c., and d. of Criterion E are concluded against Applicant.</P>

<P>	The Government has established its case under Criterion J.  Applicant's willfully withholding
information from the DoD on matters that are clearly relevant to his security clearance eligibility
violates 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.  The information withheld by Applicant had the potential to influence the
course of the background investigation in areas of legitimate concern to the DoD.  Criterion J is
concluded against Applicant.</P>
