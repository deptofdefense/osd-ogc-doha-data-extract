<P>Although his family ties to Peru and Columbia raise a security concern, Applicant has successfully mitigated the concern because the totality of the facts and

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On October 22, 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR)<A HREF="03-10741.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline C (Foreign 
Preference) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on November 14, 2003, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The 
case was assigned to me on February 20, 2004.  On April 8, 2004, I convened a hearing by video-teleconference to consider whether it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government offered four documents, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4.  The Applicant offered 24 
documents, which were admitted without objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through X.  I left the record open after the hearing to afford Applicant the 
opportunity to submit additional documents.  The Applicant timely submitted three additional documents, which were admitted without objection as AE Y 
through AE AA.  DOHA received the transcript on April 20, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 46-year-old unmarried man.  He is employed as a senior communications engineer for a defense contractor and seeks a security clearance.  He 
and his younger sister were born in Peru of a Peruvian mother and an American<A HREF="03-10741.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> father and consequently held dual citizenship from birth.  When Applicant was 
very young, his parents emigrated back to the United States.  Before leaving Peru, Applicant's mother obtained a Peruvian passport for him.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant was seven years old, his parents were killed in a plane crash.  Adult family members determined that Applicant and his younger sister would 
be raised by their maternal grandparents in Peru.  Consequently, Applicant and his sister returned to Peru.  While Applicant was growing up, he maintained 
frequent contact with his relatives in the United States to include a half sister, a half brother, several cousins, and extended families  and "visited them as much 
as possible."  Tr. 43.  He attended a prominent university in Peru from March 1977 to December 1986 and earned a degree in industrial engineering. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After graduating from university, Applicant was employed by a Peruvian company from January 1986 to September 1992.  From September 1992 to April 
2000, Applicant was employed as a computer systems analyst by an American company and was assigned to locations in the United States, Bolivia, and 
Columbia.  It was during his posting to Columbia that Applicant met his fiancee and mother of his son.  Tr. 57. His son is three years old.  AE M.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant was posted to Columbia, his company underwent a reduction in force.  He was let go and began a period of unemployment that lasted from 
April 2000 to November 2000.  In August 2000, Applicant left Columbia and returned to the United States seeking employment.  He held two short-term jobs 
until he secured his present position.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It was not until after Applicant received his SOR that he was informed Department of Defense Policy<A HREF="03-10741.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> viewed possession and/or use of a foreign passport as a 
disqualifying condition for individuals seeking a security clearance.  Consequently, Applicant  surrendered his Peruvian passport and renounced his Peruvian 
citizenship to the Peruvian Consulate on April 7, 2004.  AE AA.  Tr. 36-37, 40-42.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's sister lives in Peru with her husband and three children.  Her husband works for a large Peruvian company that is affiliated with an American 
company and has been posted to Peru since 1995.  Tr. 52.  Before being assigned to Peru, Applicant's sister and her family lived in the United States.  
Applicant's sister and her three children are American citizens.  She has been a housewife and has not worked outside the home since she arrived in Peru.  
Applicant's sister and her husband are not politically affiliated with nor do they work for the Peruvian government.  AE Y.  Applicant has seen his sister on 
average once a year during the last four-to-five years.  He maintains contact with her through e-mail, birthday cards, and telephone calls on "an irregular basis."  
Tr. 61.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since September 2003, Applicant started a small business in the United States, in addition to holding down his full-time job.  He is financially and otherwise 
completely vested in the United States.  AE A through K.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000, Applicant was visiting Peru during an election.  As required by Peruvian law, he voted, which is mandatory for all Peruvian citizens under the age of 
70.  Applicant has not voted in a Peruvian election since then nor at any time while outside Peru.  AE O.  Tr. 55-56.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's fiancee and son are resident citizens of Columbia.  Applicant submitted an application for a Consular Report of Birth Abroad on behalf of his son, 
born February 16, 2002 in Columbia.  Applicant's request was denied.  Although he had resided in the United States the period of time required to transmit 
citizenship to his son, he was not able to submit the appropriate evidence.  AE M.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 28, 2003, Applicant submitted a Petition for Fiancee to bring his fiancee to the United States.  AE N.  While Applicant is waiting for his fiancee and 
son to join him, he is sends them support money.  His fiancee is an artisan, who does paintings, engravings, and other miscellaneous art work, which she sells.  
His fiancee is not politically affiliated with nor does she work for the Columbian government.  Applicant maintains frequent telephone contact with his fiancee.  
Tr. 57-60.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is registered to vote and exercises all rights of American citizenship.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant submitted 14  character references from friends, family, and professional associates attesting to his good character and patriotism.  Additionally, four 
character witnesses testified and echoed the same sentiments.  In short, all character evidence was very favorable and convincing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive.  The government has the burden of proving any 
controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, and the facts must have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." As 
Commander in Chief, the President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for 
access to classified information to "United States citizens . . . whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, 
strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for 
coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Executive Order 12968, 
<EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines 
contained in the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, 
or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. All that is required is proof of facts and 
circumstances which indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of 
judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information. Where the facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an 
applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, then the applicant has the ultimate burden of establishing his security suitability with substantial evidence in 
explanation, mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  <EM>See </EM>Executive Orders 10865 &sect; 2 and 12968 &sect; 3.1(b). 
"Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." 
Directive &para; E2.2.2 "The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM> See Egan</EM>, 
484 U.S. at 531.  Doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon considering of all the facts in evidence, and after applying all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described above, I 
conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline C.  Applicant's dual citizenship, possession of a Peruvian passport, and having voted in a Peruvian 
elections raised a foreign preference concern.  The concern as noted in Directive E2.A3.1.1. states: <EM>When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a 
preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests 
of the United States.</EM>  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The circumstances surrounding Applicant's dual citizenship are somewhat unique.  Applicant's American father met and married his Peruvian mother in Peru.  
Shortly after Applicant was born in Peru, his parents moved to the United States.  Hence, Applicant's dual citizenship came about as a result of being born in 
Peru to a Peruvian mother.  Applicant's mother obtained a Peruvian passport for him while he was a toddler before leaving Peru.  Tragically, his parents were 
killed in a plane crash when Applicant was seven, and Applicant and his sister were returned to Peru to live with their maternal Peruvian grandparents.  His 
having voted in Peru in 2000 occurred during a visit.  As noted, in Peru voting is mandatory.  Such factors trigger Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition 
(FC DC) E2.A3.1.2.1. (<EM>The exercise of dual citizenship</EM>); FC DC E2.A3.1.2.2. (<EM>Possession and/or use of a foreign passport); </EM>and FC DC E2.A3.1.2.8 <EM>(Voting</EM> <EM>in 
foreign elections).</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After being apprised of the Money Memo contents, Applicant renounced his Peruvian citizenship and surrendered his Peruvian passport to the Peruvian Consul.  
Applicant has cured this concern by the very definite and final action of formally renouncing his Peruvian citizenship and surrendering his passport effective 
April 7, 2004.  Applicable Foreign Preference Mitigating Condition (FP MC) include full compliance with the Money Memo, FP MC E2.A3.1.3.1 <EM>(Dual 
citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country)</EM>; and FP MC <EM>(Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual 
citizenship).</EM>  Applicant happening to visit Peru in 2000 during an election and complying with the mandatory voting requirement  can hardly be viewed as an 
event he sought out.  In any event, Applicant is no longer a Peruvian citizen bound by Peruvian law requiring him to vote in future elections.  Allegations 1.a. 
through 1.c. are concluded for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has established its case under Guideline B.  Applicant's fiancee and son are resident citizens of Columbia, and his sister is a dual citizen of 
Peru and the United States and resides in Peru.  The concern as noted in Directive E2.A2.1.1. states: <EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate 
family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or 
may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Common sense suggests the stronger the ties of allegiance or obligation, the more vulnerable a person is to being manipulated if the relative, cohabitant, or 
close associate is brought under control or used as a hostage by a foreign intelligence or security service.  Concerning family ties, the language of Guideline B 
does not require a conclusion that an unacceptable security concern exists based solely on a applicant's family ties in a foreign country.<A HREF="03-10741.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  An administrative 
judge must consider the record evidence as a whole in deciding if the facts and circumstances of a applicant's family ties pose an unacceptable security concern 
under Guideline B.<A HREF="03-10741.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's family situation gives rise to Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC)  E2.A2.1.2.1. <EM>(An immediate family member, or a person to whom 
the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country).</EM>  Applicant's sister, like him, is a dual citizen 
of the United States and Peru by virtue of her having a Peruvian mother and American father and by birth in Peru.  Applicant's sister is a stay-at-home 
housewife and mother of three children, accompanying her husband whose employer has posted him to Peru.  Neither she nor her husband are affiliated with the 
Peruvian government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's fiancee and son are resident citizens of Columbia.  Applicant has submitted the necessary paperwork to bring his fiancee and son to the United 
States.  There is little else he can do in this regard except allow the process to continue.  Applicant's fiancee is an artisan, who makes various crafts and is not 
affiliated with the Columbian government.  Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. <EM>(A determination that the immediate family 
member(s),( . . . sons . . . ), cohabitant(s), or associates in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a 
way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) and the United States) </EM>applies.  Applicant's contact with his fiancee and son are 
consistent behavior with a person in his situation.  Allegations 2.a. through 2.c. are concluded for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's ties and connections to the United States are substantial and deserving of consideration in mitigation.  Applicant has renounced his Peruvian 
citizenship, surrendered his Peruvian passport, participates in the American electoral process, set up a part-time business in the United States, centered his 
professional life in the United States, maintains frequent contact with his American relatives, and has done everything required to bring his fiancee and son to 
the United States.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In summary, the record evidence demonstrates Applicant has all the indicators of an industrious, mature, responsible, and trustworthy individual.  After 
weighing the record evidence as a whole, it is my commonsense determination that the facts and circumstances show Applicant's ties to Peru and Columbia do 
not pose an unacceptable risk or concern of foreign influence.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the whole-person concept and the appropriate factors 
and guidelines in the Directive.  And I have weighed the record evidence as a whole, and conclude the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence.  
Under the totality of the facts and circumstances, I conclude Applicant has met his burden.</SPAN></P>
