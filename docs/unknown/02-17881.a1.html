  The Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant falsified a security clearance application is sustainable.  The Judge was not compelled to conclude Applicant's falsification was mitigated solely because Applicant had reduced or eliminated his vulnerability to coercion or blackmail by disclosing to his spouse  and family the existence of a child he had as a result of an extramarital affair.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all the  record evidence.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated March 18, 2003 which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Administrative 
Judge Joseph Testan issued an unfavorable security clearance decision dated November 26, 2003.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a security clearance application; (2) 
whether the Administrative Judge should have concluded Applicant's security clearance application omission was mitigated because Applicant is no longer 
vulnerable to coercion or blackmail; and (3) whether the Administrative Judge failed to consider or give due weight to the favorable evidence Applicant 
presented.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>,<EM> </EM>ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by finding Applicant falsified a security clearance application</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant 
falsified a security clearance application by not disclosing a child he had as the result of an extramarital affair.  On appeal, Applicant challenges that finding by 
arguing: (a) there is no evidence that the child in question is his child; and (b) the omission of the child from the security clearance application was not a 
falsification for various other reasons.  Applicant's claim of error is not persuasive.</P> 
 
<P>(a) SOR paragraph 1.c alleged that Applicant falsified a security clearance application by not disclosing a child that he had as the result of an extramarital affair.  
If Applicant did not have a child as the result of an extramarital affair, then there could not be a falsification of the security clearance application as alleged in 
SOR paragraph 1.c.  Accordingly, whether Applicant had such a child is a threshold factual predicate to the falsification allegation in SOR paragraph 1.c.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's finding that Applicant is the father of a child that is the result of an extramarital affair is not erroneous just because Applicant 
correctly points out that the record below does not contain certain kinds of evidence proving the child in question is his.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 94-1055 
(May 8, 1996) at p. 3 ("Nothing in the Directive requires Department Counsel to prove its case against an applicant through any specific form of evidence.").  
The Judge can make findings of fact that reflect a reasonable interpretation of relevant, credible record evidence.  Given the record evidence in this case, the 
Judge's finding that Applicant had a child as the result of an extramarital affair is sustainable.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.</P> 
 
<P>(b) During the proceedings below, apart from Applicant's claim that he did not have a child as the result of an extramarital affair, Applicant denied that he 
falsified the security clearance application.  Applicant's denials were relevant and material evidence that the Administrative Judge had to consider.  However, 
Applicant's denials were not binding or conclusive on the Judge.  The Judge had to assess the credibility of Applicant's testimony, consider Applicant's denials 
in light of the record evidence as a whole, and make a finding about Applicant's intent or state of mind when he completed the security clearance application.  
<EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-0194 (February 29, 2000) at p. 3.  The Judge specifically noted Applicant gave different explanations for why he did not disclose 
the existence of the child when he completed the security clearance application and concluded Applicant's differing explanations were not credible.  Giving due 
deference to the Judge's credibility determination, the Board concludes the Judge's finding that Applicant falsified the security clearance application is 
sustainable.  <EM>See</EM> Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.</P> 
 
<P>(2) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge should have concluded Applicant's security clearance application omission was mitigated because Applicant is no longer 
vulnerable to coercion or blackmail</SPAN>.  Applicant argues, in the alternative, that the Administrative Judge should have concluded his omission was mitigated 
because Applicant is no longer vulnerable to coercion or blackmail.  This argument fails to demonstrate the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge specifically concluded that Applicant was no longer vulnerable to coercion or blackmail because his extramarital affair and the child 
that was born as a result of that affair have been disclosed to his family members (Decision at p. 2).  That favorable conclusion did not require the Judge to 
conclude Applicant's falsification of the security clearance application was mitigated.  A falsification can be aggravated if an applicant is vulnerable to coercion 
or blackmail because of that falsification.  However, even in the absence of any vulnerability to coercion or blackmail, a falsification demonstrates poor 
judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness.  Accordingly, the Judge's conclusion that Applicant was no longer vulnerable to coercion or blackmail did not 
preclude the Judge from concluding Applicant's falsification still raised serious concerns about Applicant's security eligibility under Guideline E (Personal 
Conduct).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-08052 (June 23, 2003) at p. 3 (discussing how falsification raises serious security concerns even if there is no 
vulnerability to coercion or blackmail involved).</P> 
 
<P>(3) <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to consider or give due weight to the favorable evidence Applicant presented</SPAN>.  Applicant also notes his past 
military service and past possession of a security clearance.  The Board construes Applicant's reference to those matters as raising the issue of whether the 
Administrative Judge failed to consider or give due weight to the favorable evidence Applicant presented.</P> 
 
<P>There is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  Apart from that legal principle, the Judge specifically noted the favorable evidence concerning Applicant's 
background (including his past military service) and concluded that the evidence presented by Applicant was insufficient to overcome the negative security 
implications of Applicant's falsification of the security clearance application.  Applicant's disagreement with the Judge's conclusion about the weight of that 
favorable evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge ignored that evidence or weighed it in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> The Administrative Judge's decision does not set forth specific formal findings about each of the SOR paragraphs.  Reading the Judge's decision in its 
entirety, the Board concludes the Judge implicitly reached favorable conclusions under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) about the matters covered by SOR 
paragraphs 1.a and 1.b.  Accordingly, for purposes of deciding this appeal, the Board construes the decision below as indicating the Judge relied solely on SOR 
paragraph 1.c to base his unfavorable security clearance decision.
