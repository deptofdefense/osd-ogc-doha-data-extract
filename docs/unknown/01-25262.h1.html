<P>The Applicant provided a false resume to his employer knowing that resume would be used as part of his employer's bid proposal on a federal contract.  
Because of the Applicant's deliberate falsification, clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On December 7, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-25262.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 
14, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2002.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
February 8, 2002, and for good cause a second Notice of Hearing was issued on March 5, 2002, scheduling the hearing which was held on March 8, 2002. The 
Government's case consisted of ten exhibits (Gov Ex).  The Applicant relied on his own testimony.  A transcript (tr.) of the hearing was received on March 15, 
2002. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG>PROCEDURAL MATTERS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P>Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to include at the end of paragraph 1.a. the words, ", or to meet the requirements of a bid proposal."  There being 
no objection to the amendment, the SOR was so amended.  Information concerning the Applicant's driver's license, (Gov Ex 7) driver improvement program, 
(Gov Ex 8) and license reinstated (Gov Ex 9) was presented.  These matters not being alleged in the SOR were therefore not relevant nor considered in reaching 
my decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The SOR alleges personal conduct (Guideline E) which the Applicant admitted the allegations in part and denied the allegations in part.  The Applicant denies 
that he provided a falsified resume to secure employment and denies he intentionally falsified his Security Clearance Application, Standard (Std) Form 86.</P> 
<P>The Applicant is 49 years old, has worked for a federal contractor since November 1997, and is seeking a security clearance.  As a "certified executive 
housekeeper," he is responsible for contract management and administration. (tr. 55)</P> 
<P>From September 1969 to June 1970, the Applicant attended one college and from June 1970 until May 1971, he attended a different college.  From September 
1977 until December 1979, the Applicant attended a third college achieving an associate of arts (AA) degree.  The Applicant's Security Clearance Application, 
Standard (Std) Form 86, (Gov Ex 1) reflects his AA degree. </P> 
<P>The Applicant was employed by a hospital janitorial company from February 1989 to April 1997.  In February 1994, after the Applicant had been working for 
the company for five years, the company's federal contract came up for renewal.  The new contract required some company employees to have BS or higher 
degrees.  At contract renewal time, the Applicant was asked to submit a resume (Gov Ex 3) and was told it would be good for the employees to show college 
degrees.  In his resume, the Applicant stated he had a four-year university degree when in fact he only had a two-year college degree.  He did this to meet the 
requirements of the proposal. (tr. 28)  His employer did not force him or pressure him to put this on his resume.  The Applicant submitted his resume knowing 
it would be submitted to the government as part of the bid package. (tr. 29)  The same resume was included by the company in two bid proposals. </P> 
<P>The Applicant had a good working relation with one of the company's vice president.  This ended in 1994, when the company's co-owner and vice president 
died. Starting in 1994, the Applicant began to daily receive extreme verbal abuse (tr. 23, 36) and threats of physical abuse by company employees.  All of the 
company's management was family or close friends of the surviving owner (tr. 34, 61) who treated the Applicant as an outsider. He did not speak Spanish, the 
language used by the owner, management staff, and many of the employees.  In May 1994, the Applicant received a letter (Gov Ex 4) concerning his work 
performance.  Specifically addressed were: the timeliness of daily reports, the Applicant bringing his sick son to work, late arrival, ignoring company practices 
or policies involving routine matters, and the Applicant's lack of assistance in resolving a grievance.  Following the letter, the Applicant continued to work for 
the company for three years. </P> 
<P>In early 1997, for two and a half months the Applicant was working 12 to 14 hours each day providing management support.  By April 1997, the Applicant had 
had enough of the treatment at the company and decided to leave for health and well being. (tr. 35)  He was unhappy at work, felt abused, mistreated, and feared 
for his own safety and that of his family. (tr. 40)  He resigned from the company after negotiating a consulting agreement (Gov Ex 5) whereby the Applicant 
would be paid his current salary for an additional five months as a consultant for the company.  In early 2001, the company's current operations manager 
contacted the Applicant and asked the Applicant to again work for the company. (tr. 34)</P> 
<P>After the Applicant left the company, the company was investigated for contract and tax fraud. The Applicant was interviewed as a witness against the 
company, but he was not the subject of the investigation. </P> 
<P>In November 1997, the Applicant took a job in the same hospital working for a different government contractor.  The Applicant was asked to complete an 
Applicantion for Employment. (Gov Ex 10)  The Applicant updated his previous resume by simply adding his most recent work experience and did not change 
his level of education which reflected four years of college education.  The form did not ask if the Applicant had graduated or if he had received a degree. 
Although the Applicant remembers this form being completed three or four months after having secured the job (tr. 79), the form is dated on the first page as 
November 1997.  There is no indication as to whether this date was the current date when the form was completed or was backdated to an earlier date when the 
form was actually completed.  The Applicant told individuals at this company he had a college degree from a state university which was false. (tr. 30)  He also 
told other individuals, at the same company, he had a college degree--which was true<A HREF="01-25262.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>--and did not further elaborate. (tr. 31) The company used this 
information in two Federal contract proposals, however those proposals did not impose any type of employee educational requirement. (tr. 31)  The Applicant 
has not told his current employee he does not have a four-year degree for he is afraid to tell them. (tr. 32) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In March 2000, the Applicant answered "no" to Std Form 86 Question 20 which asked about the Applicant's employment record during the prior 10 years.  He 
was asked if he had been fired  from a job, quite a job after being told he would be filed, left a job following allegations of misconduct, unsatisfactory 
performance, or for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Personal Conduct (Guideline E) </STRONG> The Concern:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.  The following will 
normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">2.  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:  E2.A5.1.3. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">None Apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish his security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, 
mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue his security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge 
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under guideline E, (Personal Conduct).  Under Guideline E, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when that applicant is shown to have been involved in personal conduct which creates doubt about the person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness.  Complete honesty and candor on the part of applicants for access to classified information is essential to make an accurate and meaningful 
security clearance determination.  Without all the relevant and material facts, a clearance decision is susceptible to error, thus jeopardizing the nation's security. 
The nature of Applicant's actions and activities, in providing false information to his employer which he knew would be reviewed in bid proposals submitted to 
the Federal government, poses a serious potential risk to the nation's security precautions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Applicant provided his employer false information concerning his level of education by indicating he had four years of education when in fact he only had 
an AA degree from a two-year college.  The information was provided to his employer not to get a job, for he already had the job, but in response to his 
employer's request for the information to be included in the employer's bid proposal.  The Applicant knew at the time he provided the information it would be 
relied upon by the Federal government in the potential awarding of a Federal contract.  The falsified facts were both relevant and material.  The resume is a 
personal history statement and the awarding of a contract is a "benefit" to the Applicant for not getting the contract might have had an impact on the 
Applicant's employment. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Because his actions were a deliberate falsification of material facts on a personal history form used in a proposal to award federal contracts, Disqualifying 
Condition 2<A HREF="01-25262.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies.  None of the mitigating conditions (MC) apply to the falsification to his first employer. </P> 
<P>MC 1<A HREF="01-25262.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN> does not apply because the falsification is pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. MC 2<A HREF="01-25262.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN> does not apply, for although the 
false information given his employer about his education submitted in February 1994 is not a recent event it was not isolated.  The same falsification was 
submitted to two different companies and was part of numerous bid proposals to the Federal government.  MC 3<A HREF="01-25262.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN> does not apply for there is no evidence the 
Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted by the facts.  In fact, the Applicant has yet to inform his current 
employer about his false statement concerning his education because he is afraid.  MC 4<A HREF="01-25262.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> does not apply because the falsification was not the result of improper 
or inadequate advice.  MC 5, 6, and 7 are not relevant to this case.  Since none of the mitigating conditions apply, I find against the Applicant as to SOR 
subparagraph 1.a</P> 
<P>Although the same resume was submitted to his second employer and included in two additional bid proposals, those proposals impose no educational 
requirements for employees.  As such, the falsification was relevant, but was not material.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.b. </P> 
<P>The Applicant answered "no" to Question 20 on his Std Form 86, concerning his employment record.  After the death of a co-owner, a hostile work 
environment developed for the Applicant.  The company employed mostly related individuals and he was not part of the family.  Although the Applicant had 
received a letter concerning his work performance three years before leaving, the events covered by the letter were not the reasons for his leaving. By April 
1997, he was unhappy with his work, felt abused, mistreated, and feared for his own safety and that of his family.  After resigning, the Applicant was paid his 
full salary for an additional five months.  It is unreasonable to assume the Applicant would have been offered five additional months of salary if he was leaving 
for misconduct, unsatisfactory performance, or for "other reasons under unfavorable circumstances."  In fact, four years after leaving the company, the company 
asked the Applicant if he was interested in again working for the company.  This is also unlikely if the Applicant left under unfavorable circumstances.  An 
applicant's job dissatisfaction is not the type of leaving "a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances" contemplated in Question 20.  The 
Applicant's response to Question 20 on the Std Form 8 was not deliberately false.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 1.c. </P> 
<P>In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </P> 
<P>The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time occurrence, but is based on current disqualifying and mitigating conditions.  Under the 
Applicant's current circumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance, in 
the future, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness.  A clearance at this time is not warranted.</P>
