<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) refers to Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, and DoD Directive
5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.  A memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of
Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), dated November 19, 2004 states DOHA shall utilize provisions of the Directive to resolve
contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.  In this case, the pertinent disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the Regulation and the Directive are the substantially the same. 
Paragraph C8.2.1 of the Regulation provides that the procedural rules of the Directive apply for contractor personnel.   </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>On September 17, 2002 and November 8, 2004, Applicant submitted Questionnaires for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  On August 15, 2006, DOHA issued a SOR to her,
pursuant to the Directive and Regulation.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conditions).  The SOR detailed reasons why
DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P>

<P>In a notarized, sworn answer, received at DOHA on October 16, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  On October 31, 2006, the
case was assigned to me.  The hearing was held on November 30, 2006.  At the hearing I approved Applicant's request that I hold the record open so she could submit additional documentary
evidence (R. 62). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (R.) on December 13, 2006, and I received it on December 14, 2006.  Department Counsel had no objection to my consideration of the
evidence Applicant provided, and I admitted her additional evidence (Ex. K) on January 3, 2007.    </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P>

<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was responsible for the 29 debts listed on the SOR, but also indicated one SOR debt was a duplication.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Her admissions
are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P>

<P>Applicant is 44 years old.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  For the last 13 years, she has been employed by a United States government contractor, and she is involved with processing sensitive medical records.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>   She has access
to social security numbers and other private information (R. 6-7). She has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  She has a high school diploma.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P>In 2000 and 2001, her grandmother became ill, and Applicant took leave from her job to care for her (R. 27, 35).  Her grandmother died in May of 2001 (R. 29).  The last couple months of her
grandmother's life, Applicant only worked a day or two per week (R. 29).  </P>

<P>Applicant had back surgery in the late 1980s and again in the early 1990s (R. 33, 35).  She had brain surgery in 2004 (R. 33).  She was unable to work from November 2004 to January 2005 (R. 34). 
At first she used up her sick leave (R. 34).  Then she received disability pay of 60 percent of her salary for four weeks ( R. 34).  However, there was a 2-3 week gap where she did not receive any
income (R. 34).</P>

<P>Applicant was married in 1980, and has two children (born in 1980 and 1986).<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  She assists her children with college tuition (R. 27, 44).  For example, she provided her daughter $600 the last half
of 2006.  Her husband is employed, but she does not know his income (R. 23).  For the 26 years of their marriage, he has kept his money in a separate account (R. 23, 24).  She pays the family bills,
and he provides $400 to $500 per month to her (R. 23, 24).    Her husband's support is inconsistent.  Over the years of their marriage, her husband was moved in and out of her residence (R. 27).  </P>

<P>Applicant made payments on some of her delinquent accounts from 2000 to 2006 ( R. 28).  However, few of her creditors were willing to accept small payments (R. 28).  She waited until November
2006 to seek credit counseling because she did not believe she had such bad credit until she reviewed the credit reports (R. 41).  Her employer provided financial counseling services to her for free
(R. 41).  On November 2, 2006, and her credit counselor told her to contact her creditors (R. 40, 53-56).  Her credit counselor made suggestions about how she could reduce her expenses (R. 54). 
They also made plans about tracking expenses and setting up a budget (R. 54, 68).   She has begun cutting back her expenses, and her daughter has cut her expenses too (R. 68).</P>

<P>Applicant currently drives a 2003 Chevy Malibu (R. 43).  She made payments on it, and now the lien is completely paid (R. 43).  The lien on her husband's 1989 Ford Ranger is also paid in full (R.
43). </P>

<P>In her response to the SOR, dated October 12, 2006, she stated, "I am now in the process of contacting each company on the [SOR] to make arrangements to satisfy all debt. . . . I now understand
and agree I have neglected to satisfy the debt[,] but I will begin to correct the situation.  I am responsible for all this debt. It is my hope that at the hearing I will be able to provide documentation
showing I have satisfied some of the debt and that I am working on satisfying all of the debt."</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's personal financial statement (PFS) prepared in early November 2006  indicated her monthly net pay after deducting ten percent for retirement is $3,127.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  She listed monthly household
expenses as follows:  rent ($351), groceries ($200), clothing ($75), utilities ($300), car expenses ($100), taxes ($150), children's expenses ($500), insurance ($655), debt payments ($150), and
miscellaneous ($285).  She did not list any other debt payments or other liabilities.  After deducting all expenses, she had a positive cash flow of $111 per month.  This monthly net pay did not
include her husband's salary (R. 66).  He provides about $400 to $500 per month to their household (R. 67).  After paying all expenses she believed she has more than $111 left over each month,
and perhaps as much as $300 or $400 per month (R. 67).  She did not explain why $655 is allocated for insurance payments.  Her November 28, 2005, PFS was somewhat different from the PFS
she provided to her financial counselor in 2006.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two character witnesses who have known Applicant for many years described her as intelligent, honest, trustworthy, inquisitive, diligent, respectful and having excellent leader qualities, especially
integrity (Ex. K at 3, 12).  Applicant provided three of her performance reviews, which showed solid work performance on behalf of the government contractor (Ex. H, I and J).     </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P>

<P>Question 22b of her 2002 and 2004 SF 85Ps asks, "<STRONG>YOUR FINANCIAL RECORD </STRONG> Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation?  Include loans or obligations
funded or guaranteed by the Federal Government."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Applicant answered, "No."  SOR &para; 2.a alleges that this answer is false.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Her 2005 statement to an OPM investigator did not mention the
falsification issue (Ex. 5).<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  The following colloquy between Department Counsel and Applicant provides her explanation for answering, "No" to Question 22b:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  Okay.  You were aware that you had accounts that had been placed for collection, weren't you?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  I did not understand that question that way.  I answered it the way I thought it, you know, should have been answered, but I didn't willfully not, you know, mis-answer (sic) it.  I honestly didn't
understand.  And I didn't understand, like, for example, when the car was repossessed, that I actually still - actually still [was] under the contract.  I didn't understand that.  I thought once they did
that, that I was still considered delinquent until (sic).  But I understand now that I'm considered delinquent until it shows a zero balance.  But I did not understand that, then.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q. What did you think the notices from them after they sold it meant?</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A. That I owed them.  But I didn't know I was still considered delinquent.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Q.  Were you - </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A.  I mean, I just misunderstood.  I just mis - I mean, I don't have a fancy explanation.  I just misunderstood.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">R. 46-47.  She reiterated that she "totally misunderstood that question" (R. 63-64).  She mentally limited the adjective, "delinquent" in Question 22b to those debts and bills that she was "actually
currently paying" (R. 64).  For example, at the time she answered Question 22b she was making car payments of $260 per month, and this debt was current and not delinquent (R. 64).  When her SF
85P was prepared, no one was around to answer her questions.  However, she did  receive guidance from other contractor employees (R. 64).     </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I carefully observed Applicant's demeanor as she addressed the falsification of her SF 85Ps.  I am convinced she answered, "No" because she truly misunderstood what information the government
was seeking.  She mentally limited the inquiry to delinquent debts that she intended to pay.  At her hearing she responded in a forthright, candid manner to the best of her ability.  After considering

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative </SPAN>judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief introductory
explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P>

<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P>

<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that,
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P>

<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8. 
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P>

<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P>

<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P>

<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal
duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  The
scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information.
Appendix 8 of the Regulation clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive
information.</SPAN> </P>

<P>Applicant's failure to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial obligations," and FC
DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.u became delinquent between 1999 and December 2003.  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.v to 1.bb became delinquent
between July 2004 and February 2006.  Twenty-one of her SOR debts have been delinquent for more than three years.  Applicant established that the debt in SOR &para; 1.cc was paid.  She began two
payment plans for twenty SOR debts, and made her first payment on each account.  One debt was a duplication.  The amounts of two SOR debts were disputed.  Five SOR debts are currently 
delinquent, including one SOR debt that was not barred by the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations for debts.           </P>

<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her failure to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay the debts, which then became delinquent and remained delinquent. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The
government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P>

<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> I conclude FC
Cs 1 and 2 do not apply because Applicant had multiple delinquent SOR debts.  </P>

<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to all of her SOR debts because the debts became delinquent as the result of her periodic unemployment, including her absence of work to support of mother who was ill. 
Her brain surgery incapacitated her from working from November 2004 to January 2005, and caused a significant loss of income and multiple medical debts.  These changes in family circumstances
are good examples of the unforseen problems that trigger application of FC MC 3, causing financial problems that may be "largely beyond the person's control."  Applicant, however, does not
receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she has made insufficient financial progress since returning to work in January 2005.  There is a paucity of evidence showing how she endeavored to pay or
resolve her SOR debts over the last two years, especially after her OPM interview on November 28, 2005, made her aware of the security significance of her financial problems. </P>

<P>She received financial counseling, and receives partial credit under FC MC 4 because there are some indications that the problem is being resolved and she is gaining control of her financial
situation.  In regard to application of the statute of limitations, FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her
debts.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN>  After receiving the SOR on August 15, 2006, she made an $78 payment resolving half of the debt in SOR &para; 1.a, and she made a $50 payment on the consolidated debt for SOR &para;&para; 1.g-1.h;
1.j-1.t; and 1.w-1.bb.  These two payments are insufficient in magnitude to warrant application of FC MC 6.  Most importantly, her past conduct in generating and failing to resolve her delinquent
debts over the last seven years is most relevant to security concerns relating to financial considerations, and weighs against mitigating financial considerations.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Personal Conduct</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>       <SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>Under Guideline E, "conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that
[applicant] may not properly safeguard classified information."   <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"deliberate
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities."  A security concern may result under PC DC 3
when an applicant deliberately provides "false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official
representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For PC DCs 2 and 3, Applicant gave a false answer to Questions 22b of her 2002 and 2004 SF 85Ps.  The evidence of record, however, does not establish falsification of Question 22b by substantial
evidence.  Although she admitted preparing her trustworthiness questionnaire, and answering incorrectly, she did not fully understood the question.<A HREF="06-17302.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>
<P>  At the time she completed the SF 85P, she
thought that the answer she provided was correct.  Her statements show confusion about which debts were supposed to be disclosed. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by substantial evidence of personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be mitigated when
the derogatory "information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.a and 2.b are not established by
substantial evidence.  The erroneous answer was a mistake, and was not made with intent to deceive. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In sum, I am satisfied that Applicant's erroneous answer to Question 22b was a mistake caused by her misunderstanding of the question.  She honestly believed that the correct answer was, "No" at
the times she provided it.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A NAME="cp248"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is currently
44 years old.  She was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her debts in a timely fashion were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">
<SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However, her inability to repay her debts resulted from her unemployment, her care for her mother, and her medical
problems.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation, positive behavior changes, and improved circumstances as indicated by self-discipline and the almost complete absence of new delinquent,
unpaid, non-medical debt over the last three years.  Moreover, changes in her financial habits resulting from her financial counseling shows signs of financial improvement in the future. </SPAN>The
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress should decrease in the future, providing she applies the financial counseling she is receiving.  Moreover, Applicant was able to pay some 
non-SOR debts, as demonstrated by payment of her car loan. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a to 1.u are not collectible because of the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations.  </SPAN><EM>See</EM> S.C. Code. Ann. &sect; 15-3-530 (listing the statute of limitations for various debts);
<EM>Carolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch</EM>, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (explaining the societal value of application of the statute of limitations to delinquent
debts).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  The debts in SOR &para;&para; 1.a, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j-1.t, and 1.w to 1.bb are included as part of two new consolidated payment plans.  The debt in SOR &para; 1.cc is paid.  Greater awareness of financial
responsibilities through financial counseling, and her recent steps to determine the scope of her debts and to consolidate many of them, should result in a trend of improved financial circumstances.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Nevertheless, her total payments since August 15, 2006 on her delinquent SOR debts totaled $128.  There have not been any payments on the debt sin SOR &para; 1.v ($313) even though it is not barred
by the 3-year South Carolina statute of limitations for debts.  There is an insufficient history that she is financially responsible, and able to live within her means. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="COLOR: #0000ff"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After weighing the disqualifying
and mitigating conditions, all facts and circumstances, the mitigating and aggravating evidence weighing for and against her, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has </SPAN>not mitigated the
trustworthiness concerns pertaining to financial considerations.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's trustworthiness eligibility and suitability is not supported by substantial evidence.

resulted from calls her family made from outside their calling area (R. 49).  After she made the $294 payment, she did not receive any correspondence from creditor (R. 38-39).  She recently learned
over the telephone that the debt was $294, but further information would be provided (R. 48).  Applicant requested information about account from creditor on December 13, 2006, using email (Ex.

and seeking two different types of information, there is less of an opportunity for mistakes.  SF 86 Question 39 apparently seeks information that is not included in Question 38. In any event, the use
of the 7-year qualifier in Question 38 versus the "current" qualifier in Question 39 is relevant because Applicant apparently applied a "current" qualifier to her answer to Question 22b.

good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant's debts.  The Directive does not define the term 'good-faith.'  However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith 'requires a showing
that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.'  Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a
legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6. </SPAN></P>
