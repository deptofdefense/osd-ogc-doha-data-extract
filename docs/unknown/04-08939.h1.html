<P>Applicant, a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, failed to mitigate drug, and personal conduct allegations for failure to report drug use while in the 
Air Force and while holding a security clearance on his security clearance application (SF 86). He also failed to report the information to a security investigator 
because he forgot it at the time. Clearance is denied. <BR>

<P><STRONG>STATEMENT OF CASE</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Information Within Industry, as amended and 
modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated June 7, 2005, to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. It 
was received by Applicant on June 14, 2005. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be 
granted, continued, denied, or revoked.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn written statement dated June 21, 2005, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on January 4, 2006. A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant did so on February 21, 2006 and the case was assigned to me on March 3, 2006.  <BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR but offered some explanatory information in his responses and interviews with the investigating officer. After 
a complete and thorough review of the information in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has worked as a mechanic for his employer since April, 2002. Applicant failed to report drug 
use that occurred while he was on active duty with the Air Force and while holding a security clearance on Questions 27 and 28 on his SF 86 dated October 15, 
2002, and in an interview with an investigator on January 9, 2003. Applicant denied that the omissions were deliberate saying that he was ashamed of his 
conduct and forgot about the drug use at the time of filing and giving the interview. Applicant received punishment under Article 112A of the Uniform Code of 
ilitary Justice for use of drugs in 2000 for which he lost his security clearance and was administratively discharged from the Air Force in September 2000 
pursuant to AFI 36-3208<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." Id. at 527.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and</P> 
 
<P>maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; 
E2.2.1. Security clearances are granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. See Executive 
Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the applicant's clearance. "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. 
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b)<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following 
with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline E, Applicant's failure to report his drug use on his SF 86 indicates questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (E2.A5.1.1.) Specifically, the deliberate omission, 
concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. 
(E2.A5.1.2.2.); deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator in connection with a 
personnel security determination (E2.A5.1.2.3.); and a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. (E2.A5.1.2.5.) His statement that he did not remember the drug 
use because he was ashamed of it is not credible in view of the detailed accounting of it contained in his statement of August 2000, only a little over two years 
before filing his SF 86. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's criminal conduct in failing to report the information and his use of drugs raises issues under Guideline J (E2.A10.1.1) involving a history or pattern 
of criminal activity creating doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. An admission of criminal conduct (E2.A10.1.2.1.) and a single 
serious crime or multiple lesser offenses (E2.A10.1.2.2.) are potentially disqualifying conditions. While the drug use was now over six years ago and would 
have been mitigated by the passage of time (E2.A10.1.3.1.), Applicant's conduct in concealing the information is recent and is compounded by his admission 
that he withheld the information because of shame about the conduct. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The "whole person" concept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits 
taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. After considering all the evidence in 
its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the whole person of Applicant, I conclude that the Applicant has offered no evidence to counter the proof and 
admission of the conduct that disqualify him from holding a security clearance and that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security 
clearance to him. <BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR>

<P><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Formal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:<BR> 
<BR>

<P>Subparagraph 1.b.:  Against Applicant</P> 
 
<P>Subparagraph 1.c.:  Against Applicant<BR>

<P>Subparagraph 2.a.:  Against Applicant <BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>After full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.<BR>
