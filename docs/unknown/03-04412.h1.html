<P>Applicant has had a long history of alcohol abuse. His alcohol abuse has resulted in three alcohol-related arrests for Driving Under the Influence (DUI), 
occurring in 1991, 1995, and 2000. Applicant received a number of alcohol abuse treatments, in which he was not ultimately successful because he continued 
consuming alcohol. His last treatment in 2000, including living in a sober living home for a year and continuing to attend two or three Alcoholics Anonymous 
(AA)  meetings a week, has been successful, because Applicant is more committed to sobriety. He has abstained from alcohol consumption since <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">April 2000. </SPAN> 
Evidence of Applicant's alcohol rehabilitation is sufficient to mitigate his alcohol related history. Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">On November  13, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN>Applicant, through his attorney, filed a <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">signed and sworn, </SPAN>notarized response, dated <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">January  8, 2004</SPAN>, to the allegations set forth in the SOR. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">He requested a 
clearance decision based on a hearing record b</SPAN>efore a DOHA Administrative Judge.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 30, 2004, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 26, 2004, the case was </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">reassigned to </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">this Administrative Judge to 
conduct a hearing<STRONG> </STRONG>and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on June 7, 2004, and the hearing was held on June 30, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant, through his counsel, offered 
eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - H) and his own testimony and that of five other witnesses. The transcript (TR) was received on July 15, 2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> In the SOR, the Government alleges that 
a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline G and Guideline J of the Directive. The SOR contains seven allegations, 1.a. through 1.g., under 
Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and one allegation, 2.a.,  under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).</SPAN> Applicant admits all of the allegations.  The admitted 
allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">admitted</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, 
and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant is 56 years old. He is married, but is in the process of a divorce, and he has a 37 year old daughter. He has been employed by the same defense 
contractor since 1976 and held a security clearance for the same period , and he seeks to retain a DoD security clearance in connection with his employment in 
the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol consumption). </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses alcohol to excess.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant has consumed alcohol since he was 18 years of age in 1966. His drinking increased during the six years that he was in the United States Navy, from 
1966 until 1972. Over the years, his consumption had escalated for periods of time until he became a binge drinker, consuming alcohol to excess for periods of 
time and then abstaining from consuming alcohol (Tr at 77) (Exhibit 3).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant's drinking has resulted in three alcohol related incidents where he was arrested and found or pled guilty to charges of DUI. They occurred  in 1991, 
1995, and 2000.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The first alcohol related incident, in which Applicant was involved, occurred in February 1991. He was arrested and pled guilty to DUI. He was sentenced to 
serve 6 days in jail, placed on probation for three years, and fined $1,030. He also had to complete a three month first conviction offender program, where he 
attended classes, lectures, and counseling regarding the use of alcohol (Tr at 78-80) (Exhibit 3). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The second  arrest occurred on September1995. He was arrested and pled guilty to DUI.  He was placed on summary probation for five years and fined $1,760. 
For this arrest he had to complete an eighteen month multiple offender program, where he again attended classes, lectures, and counseling regarding the use of 
alcohol, and he could not consume any alcohol for the eighteen month period (Tr at 80-83) (Exhibit 3). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The most recent arrest occurred in February 2000.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">He was arrested and pled guilty to DUI.  He was again placed on summary probation for five years and fined 
$1,435.  For this arrest he had to complete an additional eighteen month multiple offender program, and his driver's license was restricted for eighteen months 
(Tr at 84-86) (Exhibit 3). </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In 1998, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant referred himself for treatment for his alcohol problems and</SPAN> entered a four week in-house treatment program at a hospital. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">After completing 
the program he remained sober for one year, and then he began to consume alcohol again.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In April 2000, he again </SPAN>entered the same treatment program at the same hospital. He was diagnosed as being Alcohol dependent.  The treatment consisted of 
four weeks of in-house treatment, with individual and group counseling, attending aftercare sessions for six months, living for one year in a sober living home, 
and attending two AA meetings a week.  Applicant successfully completed this program and has abstained from consuming alcohol since <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">April 4, 2000. </SPAN>Upon 
his discharge on May 5, 2004, his primary physician wrote about Applicant, "I think his prognosis is excellent and he has responded in an extremely positive 
way to treatment at this time." He " . . . made excellent progress throughout the course of his treatment. He shows evidence of sincere commitment to remaining 
alcohol-free, including continuing in a residential sober living environment following completion of this program so that he can gain additional support for 
remaining completely alcohol-free following discharge."<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(Exhibits 3 and 4).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>  </STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Applicant now concedes that he is an alcoholic, but he did not come to that realization until he was undergoing his treatment in 2000. At the hearing he 
testified that he now realizes, "I cannot drink. I will die if I drink." (TR at 75). He currently attends two or three AA  meetings a week, and he has completed the 
12 Step program of AA on two occasions. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Four character witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Three have known him primarily through work related interaction, although there has been some 
social interaction as well. They were all aware of the employment related problems that  resulted from Applicant's alcohol abuse, but all of them believed 
Applicant no longer consumed alcohol and that he had resolved all of his alcohol related difficulties. The fourth witness knew Applicant from his one year in a 
sober living home. Her testimony was extremely positive about all Applicant did during his year at the facility to get and stay sober.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>Paragraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) </STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal acts. Applicant's conduct that occurred 
in 2000, 1995, and 1991, and which has been alleged  in the SOR as 1.a., 1.b. and 1.c. respectively, is included  in this paragraph as criminal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. 
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>As set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider 
the following factors [General Factors]:</P> 
 
<P>a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</P> 
 
<P>c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>e. The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</P> 
 
<P>g. The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</P> 
 
<P>i. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P> 
 
<P>The eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly<STRONG> </STRONG>consistent<STRONG> </STRONG>with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</P> 
 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day. The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's 
part.</P> 
 
<P>The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future." The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this 
order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."<STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><CENTER></CENTER> 
</STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case. The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in 
proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that Applicant has used alcohol to excess (Guideline G) and has 
engaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J). Applicant, on the other hand, has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is 
sufficient to overcome the Government's case against him.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Paragraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>While Applicant has had a long history of consuming alcohol to excess, he was credible when he testified that <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">he last consumed alcohol on April 4, 2000, and 
there has been no evidence to contradict his testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">All of Applicant's treatment has been as a result of his own initiative. While his earlier treatment ultimately resulted in his drinking again, the evidence has 
been extremely persuasive that he is far more committed to sobriety, and that he has a better overall support team, including  AA,  to help him to remain sober. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was involved in alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the 
influence, which is Disqualifying Condition (DC) (E2.A7.1.2.1.), and that Applicant has received an diagnosis of alcohol dependence by a credentialed medical 
professional </SPAN>which is <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Disqualifying Condition (DC) </SPAN>(E2.A7.1.2.3.). It has also been established <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">by substantial evidence that Applicant  has engaged in habitual 
or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment which is which is DC </SPAN>(E2.A7.1.2.5.). </P> 
 
<P>Mitigating Condition (MC) (E2.A7.1.3.3.) applies because of the positive changes in Applicant's behavior supportive of sobriety. Also, MC (E2.A7.1.3.4.) is 
applicable because Applicant has successfully completed an outpatient rehabilitation  program, including aftercare, and has been extremely committed to AA; 
he has abstained from alcohol for greater than twelve months; and he has received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional.  Overall, the 
mitigating conditions outweigh the disqualifying conditions, and Paragraph 1 is concluded for Applicant.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG>(Guideline J -Criminal Conduct)</STRONG> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Government also established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in </SPAN>criminal conduct in the years 2000, 1995, and 1991, as h<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">e was arrested for, 
and convicted of, DUIs</SPAN>. DC (E2.A10.1.2.1.), allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, and DC 
(E2.A10.1.2.2), a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, apply in this case. MC (E2.A10.1.3.1.) applies because the last criminal conduct occurred on 
February 8, 2000, more than 4 years ago. Also, MC (E2.A10.1.3.6.) is applicable because Applicant has successfully completed an extensive rehabilitation  
program. Paragraph 3 is found for Applicant. </P> 
 
<P>On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance. Accordingly, the 
evidence supports a finding for Applicant as expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's SOR. </P>
