<P>Applicant is 37 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor.  He has 24 delinquent debts from 1996 up to 2002.  He is paying four of them, but the 
remaining 20 remain unpaid because Applicant denies he owes them, cannot remember the debt, or claims the debt is too old for the creditor to find in its

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On February 24, 2005, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-23855.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Directive.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on May 13, 2005.  Applicant requested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
<P>On July 11, 2005, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written case.  A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the 
Applicant.  He was given  the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  Applicant did not file a response to 
the FORM within the 30 day time allowed that expired on September 10, 2005. The case was assigned to me on October 18, 2005. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and full consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is 36 years old, married, and works for a defense contractor.  He incurred numerous delinquent debts dating back to 1996 and up to 2002.  Applicant 
served in the military from 1988 to 1996, and claims most of his debts were incurred during that time.  However, only four of the 24 delinquent debts date from 
1996. (Items 2, 3, 6 and 7)</P> 
<P>The only delinquent debt listed in the SOR that Applicant is paying on is the judgment listed at subparagraph 1.l to a collection agency for the hospitals listed in 
subparagraphs 1.f. and 1.m.  The judgment was for $3,174.89 entered on July 12, 2000.  Applicant paid on it for a while, then defaulted, after which his wages 
were garnished, and the garnishment stopped when he changed employers.  Now he is paying the creditor directly, and claims he owes only $800. (Items 8, 9, 
11, and 13)</P> 
<P>Applicant has not paid he remaining delinquent debts listed in the SOR, either because he claims he cannot find the creditor, cannot remember the creditor, or 
has done nothing to pay the creditor.  There are 17 debts under $1,000 that total about $4,600.  The other debts total about $30,000.  Applicant presented no 
evidence of any sustained or verifiable efforts to pay these delinquent debts between 1996 and the present.  The current delinquent debts are summarized as 
follows:</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, <EM>Safeguarding 
Classified Information with Industry</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960)<EM>. </EM> Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant 
"has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into 
account in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well 
as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common 
sense determination required.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the Directive.  
Those assessments include:  (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of 
knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the 
potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). 
Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or 
that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable 
determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
other behavior specified in the Guidelines.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection between proven 
conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. 
ay 2, 1996).  All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an 
applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No. 
00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case by substantial evidence, the burden 
shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  "Any doubt as to 
whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive &para; E2.2.2.  
"[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F:Financial Considerations: <EM>The Concern</EM>: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. E2.A6.1.1</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant's admissions each of the allegations in the SOR.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (A 
history of not meeting financial obligations E2.A6.1.2.1) and DC 3 (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts E2.A6.1.2.3) apply.  Applicant has a history of 
incurring delinquent debts, and then expending little or no effort to pay them.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">There are no Mitigating Conditions (MC) that apply to these facts.  Applicant has done nothing to pay the debts, in full or by installment payments, except for 
the judgment (subparagraphs 1.f, 1.l, and 1.m.) and the finance company debt in subparagraph 1.w.  The information he provided in response to the SOR was 
sparse and unpersuasive.  Since he completed his security clearance application in 2002 and was interviewed in June 2003 by the government investigator, he 
has not made any substantial efforts to research and pay these delinquent debts.  He mistakenly thinks that because his truck was repossessed by the credit union 
he did not have to pay the loan balance.  Then he compounds his error by thinking because the credit union writes off the debt he is absolved of the legal duty to 
pay it.  Writing off a debt is an accounting procedure for a creditor, not a debt forgiveness.  Throughout the FORM, Applicant displayed a lackadaisical effort to 
identify and pay these debts.  He did little or nothing, and by doing so, has not met his burden of proof, nor mitigated the government's security concerns.  
Therefore, I conclude this financial considerations security concern against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
