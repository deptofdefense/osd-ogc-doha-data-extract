<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant, a 46-year old self employed defense contractor and Vietnam war veteran,  convicted of a single state felony negligent homicide arrest and conviction 
in State A in 1996, was later sentenced to no less than one year or more than two years of incarceration in State A's prison on the state offense, with all but 30 
days suspended.  Applicant's conduct is perforce covered by the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986), which bars persons sentenced to more than one year 
of incarceration, regardless of time actually served, from ever holding a security clearance, absent a meritorious basis for an exception (not recommended here).  
While Applicant has successfully completed his probation and mitigated his larceny and other alcohol-related offenses, he has not mitigated the trust concerns 
raised by his SF-86 and DSS interview omissions sufficient  to merit considered restoration of the accountability and trust required to hold a security clearance.  
Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 24, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked</SPAN>.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on May 29, 2002, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on August 1, 2002, and was 
scheduled for hearing.  A hearing was convened on September 13, 2002, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of ten exhibits; Applicant relied on one 
witness (himself) and no exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on September 20, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year old self-employed defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant is alleged to have a history  of criminal activity that includes numerous separate offenses spanning 1965 and 1983.  Specifically, Applicant is alleged 
to have (a) been arrested in State A in July 1965 and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, for which he was fined $55.00, (b) received non-judicial punishment (NJP) in November 1969 under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for larceny and conspiracy, for which he was 
sentenced to a one grade reduction (suspended) and forfeiture of $50.00, (c) been arrested in July 1973 in State A and charged with negligent homicide (a 
felony) under Sec. 750-324 of State A's compiled laws and Sec. 28.556 of State A's Stats. Ann., and sentenced to not less than one year to not exceeding two 
years in State A's prison, a sentence covered by the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986), (d) been arrested in March 1981 in State A for DuI, to which he 
pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of impaired driving, and was fined $156.00 and ordered to attend alcohol traffic school, (e) been arrested in April 1982 in State 
B for driving under the influence (DuI) and fleeing to elude police and (f) been arrested in February 1983 in State B for DuI, unlawful blood alcohol while 
driving and contempt of court for failure to pay fines.</P> 
<P>Additionally, Applicant is alleged to have (i) falsified his security clearance application (SF-86) of May 2000 by omitting all of his alcohol-related 
arrests/convictions, save for his 1973 negligent homicide arrest/conviction and (ii) concealing all of his arrest history, save for his 1973 negligent homicide 
arrest/conviction, in his ensuing signed, sworn DSS statement of April 2001.</P> 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each and every allegation, while attributing memory lapse to his omitting his prior arrests.</P> 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant, a Vietnam war veteran, was arrested and convicted for negligent homicide in State A in 1973, and sentenced to no less than one year, nor more than 
two years.  He served a total of nine (9) months before being released and placed on one year's supervised probation.  Applicant's conviction arose out of his 
passing a motorcycle at a high rate of speed while under the influence of alcohol.  He struck the motorcycle proceeding in the opposite direction, killing both 
occupants (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4; R.T., at 44-45).  At the sentencing hearing, he expressed remorse for his actions, which the sentencing court characterized as careless 
driving on a revoked license hearing (<EM>see</EM> ex. 9)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides his negligent homicide conviction, Applicant was arrested and convicted of multiple offenses involving contributing to the delinquency of a minor (an 
incident he doesn't doubt occurred but doesn't remember any of the details), larceny in the Army arising out of confiscating Army vehicles while on patrol (<EM>see</EM> 
R.T.,at 38, 42-43), and DuIs between 1965 and1983; four in all.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since his last DuI offense, Applicant has remarried and stabilized his life.  With the caring  support of his current spouse, who "has put him back together 
twice" after falls from other jobs (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 39, 62), he no longer abuses alcohol and drinks only occasionally (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 63).  His spouse characterizes 
Applicant as very hard working and dependable.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When asked to complete an SF-86 in May 2000, Applicant acknowledged his 1973 negligent homicide conviction, but omitted all of his remaining alcohol-related arrests/convictions: all covered by question 24.  He attributes memory lapse to his omission of his 1965 contributing to delinquency offense, but could 
offer no explanations as to why he omitted his other alcohol-related offenses.  He makes no claim of misreading question 24, or to have been mis-advised by 
any responsible authority.  With so many DuI offenses, it is implausible that he could forget all of these arrests/convictions when he answered question 24.  Fear 
of jeopardizing his security clearance provides the most tenable explanation of Applicant's omission.  Inferences  of knowing and wilful concealment cannot be 
avoided.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by Agent A in April 2001.  When asked about any other arrests besides his 1973 arrest/conviction for negligent homicide, he 
responded in the negative (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Not until he was afforded the opportunity to respond to the SOR did he acknowledge his other arrests/convictions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>In addition to adjudicating Smith Amendment cases in accordance with current Executive Order and DoD Directive/Regulatory guidance, including applicable 
due process procedures, the criteria provide for consideration of issues covered by provisions 1 and 4 of the Act without consideration of the statute, this for the 
purpose of developing as complete a record as possible to aid the responsible authority for making a recommendation to the Sec Def as to whether the case 
merits a waiver.  The DoD regulations include revised Adjudicative Guidelines designed to implement the provisions of the Smith Amendment and supplement 
existing Adjudicative Guidelines<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which 
are intended to assist the judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision of security clearance eligibility.</SPAN>  E2.2 considerations comprise the 
following: the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct, the circumstances surrounding the conduct, the frequency and recency of the conduct, the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct, the voluntariness of participation, the presence or absence of rehabilitation, the motivation for the 
conduct, the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress, and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
<P>DoD's revised regulations are, in turn, reinforced by DOHA Operating Instruction 64, which all judges are required to follow in their implementation of Smith 
Amendment-covered cases.</P> 
<P>Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy guidelines are pertinent herein:</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC g  <STRONG>Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of 
Defense or the Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Basis: conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the 
person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 2  The deliberate omission, concealment, falsification or misrepresentation of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in 
the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that 
evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  
Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a nexus to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of nexus, however, does not require the 
Government to affirmatively demonstrate the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P>Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant comes to these proceedings with a history of alcohol-related offenses (five in all) and a larceny-based offense in the Army for which he received NJP.  
The  second of his five alcohol-related arrests came in 1973 and resulted in a felony conviction, imposed imprisonment no less than one year or more than two 
years, and court-imposed conditions, including supervised probation.  </P> 
<P><STRONG>Smith Amendment and other criminally-related conduct</STRONG></P> 
<P>By reliance on otherwise applicable mitigating conditions, Applicant's underlying actions leading to his 1973 negligent homicide conviction could be 
considered dated and the result of alcohol-related mistakes of judgment at the time, and sufficient to warrant some benefit of revised Adjudicative Guidelines 
C a (criminal behavior not recent) and MC f (there is clear evidence of rehabilitation). </P> 
<P>Applicant's satisfaction of his probation conditions and renewed indicia of rehabilitation (reinforced by  the support he draws from his current spouse) 
demonstrates evidence of increased maturity, reliability and trust.  When combined with the trust lapses evinced by his concealment of his alcohol-related 
arrests/convictions in his SF-86, however, additional seasoning would be required to enable him to reach the assurance levels necessary to make safe 
predictable judgments about his overall judgment, reliability and trustworthiness requisite for holding a security clearance, even without any consideration of 
the Smith Amendment.</P> 
<P>But as the result of Applicant's state felony conviction (sub-paragraph 1.c), he was sentenced to a period of incarceration no less than a year nor more than two 
years, which taken together manifests a sentencing initiative intended to expose Applicant to time in incarceration in excess of a year certain.  This reading of 
Applicant's incarceration term brings his imposed sentence within the coverage of the plain mandatory provisions of the Smith Amendment's provision 1.  The 
Amendment applies, even though Applicant never actually served time in excess of a year in any incarceration facility as a result of his conviction.  With the 
passage of the Smith Amendment, Congress manifested a statutory purpose for raising the level of critical scrutiny of persons with histories of serious criminal 
actions and corresponding sentencing time.  Otherwise worthy cases become less amenable to reconciliation of perceived security risks than under pre-Smith 
Amendment assessments.  Under the adjudicative guidelines implementing the Smith Amendment, Applicant's time in rehabilitation, while encouraging, still 
cannot free him from coverage of the Amendments's mandatory bar, save for his qualification for exception consideration.  On the strength of the Smith 
Amendment's mandatory lifetime disqualification of applicants whose conduct (like Applicant's) is found to be covered by the Smith Amendment's outlined 
provisions, risk absolving mitigation is  available to Applicant only by virtue of MC g of the revised guidelines (no mitigation of potentially disqualifying 
conditions, except by demonstration of sufficiently meritorious circumstances to justify the granting of a waiver by the Sec Def).</P> 
<P>Independent consideration of the mitigating conditions developed for assessing a  provision 1 situation falling under the Smith Amendment warrants no further 
consideration of a waiver in this case. Taking full account of the gravity of Applicant's covered 1973 offense, his involvement in other contemporaneous 
offenses, and his failure to disclose his army NJP and other alcohol-related arrest/convictions when asked expressly to do so in his May 2000 SF-86 and ensuing 
DSS interview,  his restorative efforts to date are considered to be too recent and insufficient to enable him to claim the mitigation benefits of several of the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline J, as well as overall favorable consideration taking into account the E.2.2 factors.  Recommendation for further consideration 
of a waiver from the <EM>per se</EM> bar requirements of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986 is not warranted.  Unfavorable conclusions are called for with respect to the allegations 
covered by sub-paragraph 1.c by virtue of the <EM>per se </EM>requirements of the Smith Amendment. </P> 
<P>Applicant's recent restorative efforts are sufficient, however, to mitigate the security implications of his larceny and other alcohol-related incidents.  He has not 
had another known arrest since his last recorded one in 1983 and has demonstrated considerable stabilization of his life in recent years with the strengthened 
support he receives from his current spouse.  With respect to these non-Smith Amendment arrests-convictions and receipt of NJP between 1965 and 1983, 
Applicant successfully carries his mitigation burden.  Favorable conclusions warrant, accordingly with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a and 1.b and 1.d of 
Guideline J.   </P> 
<P><STRONG>Applicant's covered SF-86 omissions</STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Potentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of 
Applicant's respective SF-86 omissions of his numerous alcohol-related arrests (four in all spanning 1965 and 1983) and single larceny offense.   So much trust 
is imposed on persons cleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for incidents of trust betrayal are calibrated narrowly. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant falsified his SF-86 in several material respects: omitting four of his alcohol-related arrests/convictions.  He makes no persuasive claim of 
misunderstanding question 24, which was posed in a straightforward way in the questionnaire.  Applicant's explanations for omitting the material information 
in the questionnaire and his ensuing DSS statement are considered insufficient to avert drawn conclusions of knowing and wilful concealment of facts material 
to a security clearance determination.  His omissions invite application of a disqualifying conditions (DC) for personal conduct of the Adjudicative Guidelines: 
DC 2 (falsification of a security questionnaire) and DC 3 (deliberately providing false or misleading information to an investigator or security official).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Mitigation is not available to Applicant.  Only when afforded the opportunity to answer the SOR did he admit his other arrests/convictions.   DOHA's Appeal 
Board has never found the use of mitigating condition (MC) 3 (prompt, good faith disclosure) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for personal conduct to be 
available to applicants seeking mitigation absent convincing proof of a prompt, good faith correction before being confronted with the facts.  In this vein, 
Applicant does not satisfy either of the confrontation or prompt prongs of MC 3. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E.2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions 
warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of Guideline E.  Applicant's  omissions reflect no mitigating actions either that would enable him to avoid 
treating them as subject to the felony provisions of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant as well with respect to sub-paragraph 1.h of 
Guideline J.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in the Procedures section (paragraph 6) of the 
Directive, as well as E.2.2 of the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the same Directive.</SPAN></P>
