<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola issued a decision, dated June 25, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Applicant appealed.  For the
reasons set forth below, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated November 13, 1997 to
Applicant.<A HREF="97-0699.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  The SOR was based on Criterion C (Foreign Preference) and Criterion B (Foreign Influence).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant submitted a response to the SOR, in which he indicated "I do not wish to have a hearing."  A File of Relevant
aterial (FORM) was prepared.  Applicant was provided with a copy of the FORM, and he submitted a response to it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated June 25, 1998, in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  The case is before the Board on
Applicant's appeal from that adverse decision.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Appeal Issue<A HREF="97-0699.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A></STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant contends the Administrative Judge's adverse security clearance decision should be reversed because: (1) he has
always been forthright and cooperative with the Department of Defense (DoD) about his contacts with Country B; (2) he
is a loyal United States citizen; (3) he has been a United States citizen since 1989 with extensive personal, family, and
financial ties to the United States; (4) his financial ties to Country B are significantly less than his financial ties to the
United States; (5) his actions in founding a business in Country B were necessary to protect the needs of two United
States businesses; (6) he no longer holds and no longer uses a Country B passport; (7) he no longer is a CEO of a
nonprofit corporation in Country B; (8) Country B does not have interests that are inimical to the United States; (9) no
foreign person or organization has approached Applicant or his family to obtain information; (10) the Judge failed to
consider various mitigating factors; (11) the retirement/pension benefits to which Applicant is eligible because of his
position as a professor in Country B are not significant in comparison to his financial interests in the United States and
cannot be used to threaten or coerce him; (12) he is not susceptible to coercion because his shares in a small foreign
business are of little or no financial value; and (13) the totality of his personal and professional life provides no basis to
question his loyalty to the United States and demonstrates there is no basis for fear he would demonstrate a foreign
preference or be vulnerable to foreign influence.  The Board construes Applicant's contentions as raising the issue of
whether the Judge's adverse decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.<A HREF="97-0699.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The record evidence supports Applicant's assertion that he has been candid and cooperative with the DoD about his
contacts with Country B.  However, that evidence does not render the  Administrative Judge's decision arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  An applicant's honesty and candor about the applicant's conduct does not immunize that
conduct from consideration for its security significance.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0223 (October 29, 1998) at p. 4.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's loyalty argument is misplaced.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that  industrial security
clearance decisions will not be loyalty determinations.  Nothing in the decision below indicates or suggests that the
Administrative Judge made a determination as to Applicant's loyalty.  Rather, the Judge evaluated the facts and
circumstances of Applicant's case under pertinent provisions of the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant's citation to favorable record evidence does not demonstrate the Administrative Judge erred.  The Judge must
consider all available information, both favorable and unfavorable.  Directive, Section F.3.  In doing so, the Judge must
consider whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 98-0123 (October 28, 1998) at p. 3.  Absent a showing of action by the Judge that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law,
the Board will not disturb the Judge's weighing of the record evidence.  <EM>Id</EM>.  Error is not demonstrated by the fact that
Applicant can argue for an alternate weighing of the record evidence.  A review of the record as a whole persuades the
Board that, with one exception that constitutes harmless error, the Judge weighed the evidence in a reasonable manner and
made factual findings that reflect a plausible interpretation of the record evidence as a whole.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Nothing in Criterion B or Criterion C requires that the foreign country in question have interests that are inimical to the
interests of the United States.  The primary purpose of the industrial security program is to protect classified information. 
The federal government is entitled to protect classified information from any person, organization, or nation not
authorized to receive it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or nation has interests inimical to those of the
United States.  Accordingly, the absence of evidence that Country B has interests inimical to those of the United States
does not render the Administrative Judge's decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The absence of evidence that Country B has approached Applicant, directly or through his family, to obtain access to
classified information did not preclude the Administrative Judge from making an adverse decision.  The federal
government has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. <EM> Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>,
484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The federal government need not demonstrate that there is a "clear and present danger that a
breach of security is actually threatened" before it can decide to deny or revoke an applicant's access to classified
information.  <EM>Adams v. Laird</EM>, 420 F.2d 230, 238 (D.C. Cir. 1969), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  The totality of the
following facts provided a rational basis for the Judge's findings and conclusions under Criterion B and Criterion C:
Applicant's exercise of citizenship of Country B; Applicant's voluntary possession and use of a Country B passport;
Applicant's position as a professor of a state university in Country B; Applicant's involvement in two foreign entities or
businesses in Country B; and Applicant's significant financial interests in Country B (primarily substantial retirement
benefits associated with the professorship in Country B).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">On appeal, Applicant contends the Administrative Judge erred by finding that he is a CEO of a nonprofit corporation in
Country B.  Specifically, Applicant argues that he held that position in the past, but does not hold it currently.  In support
of this contention, Applicant refers to his answer to the SOR and his response to the FORM.  This contention is not
persuasive.  A review of the record evidence shows that Applicant, in January 1998, projected surrendering his position in
arch 1998.  However, the record evidence contained no confirmation that this event had actually occurred.  Thus, the
Judge's finding on this point reflects a plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Nothing in Applicant's answer to
the SOR or his response to the FORM precluded the Judge from finding that Applicant is a CEO of a nonprofit
corporation in Country B.  Applicant's record statements about his status with that nonprofit corporation do not compel
the interpretation he asserts on appeal.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant identifies one flaw with the Administrative Judge's decision.  The record evidence shows that in March 1998
Applicant resumed residence in the United States and took full-time employment with a United States company. 
Furthermore, there is no record evidence that Applicant has used his Country B passport since resuming residence in the
United States.  Despite that record evidence, the Judge refers to Applicant's use of a Country B passport in the present
tense.  The Board does not review a sentence of a Judge's decision in isolation.  Rather, the Board reviews a Judge's
decision in its entirety.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 96-0522 (May 1, 1997) at p. 3.  Given the totality of the record evidence
(including the evidence that Applicant is on leave from his professorial post in Country B until December 31, 1999), the
Judge's reference to Applicant's use of a Country B passport in the present tense is harmless error that does not warrant a
remand.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0707 (September 1, 1998) at p. 3 (applying harmless error doctrine).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error that warrants remand or reversal.  Accordingly,
the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's June 25, 1998 decision.</FONT></P>
