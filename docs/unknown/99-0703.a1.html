<P>Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny issued a decision dated September 7, 2000, in which he concluded that it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.   Department Counsel appealed.  The
Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision for the reasons explained below.</P>

<P>The Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,
1992 as amended.</P>

<P>Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: 1. Did the Administrative Judge shift the burden of proof for resolving
doubts to the government? 2. Was the Administrative Judge's decision arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law?</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant dated February 17, 2000.  The
SOR was based on Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  Applicant requested a hearing which
was held on Friday, July 28, 2000.</P>

<P>The Administrative Judge issued a decision dated September 7, 2000 in which he found for Applicant.  The case is before the
Board on Department Counsel's appeal of that decision.</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>1. Did the Administrative Judge shift the burden of proof for resolving doubts to the government?  Department Counsel argues
that they established a prima facie case of falsification under two guidelines against Applicant by introducing two signed
statements from Applicant: one statement in which he flatly denies out of court allegations by his ex-wife that at some point in
their 27-year marriage he took home classified documents and another statement in which Applicant said that it was "possible"
that he had done so at some time with For Official Use Only (FOUO) and  confidential documents and concedes at least by
inference that this statement appears to contrast with his earlier statement.  Applicant did not actually admit to ever having taken
home classified documents although Department Counsel's argument is predicated on an interpretation of the second statement as
implying that Applicant had done so.  The Administrative Judge attributed the apparent inconsistency of the two statements to
differences in the atmosphere and questioning by security officials at the two interviews which produced the two signed
statements.  The Judge concluded that the statements were reconcilable and that Applicant had told the truth in both documents
and at the hearing.  Thus, the Judge found no falsification had occurred and implicitly that the government had failed to establish a
prima facie case.  The Administrative Judge noted that Applicant can not recall a single incident of taking home classified
documents and Applicant's assertion that his use of the word "possible" was akin to saying that it is "possible" that there are aliens
in outer space.</P>

<P>On appeal, Department Counsel focuses on the lack of corroborating evidence for Applicant's denial of having taken classified
documents home.  Assuming that Applicant's denial is accurate, it is hard to imagine what such corroborating evidence could be. 
Department Counsel's argument in this case demands more than is reasonable.  </P>

<P>The Administrative Judge must make an overall common sense determination in light of the evidence viewed as a whole.  The
Administrative Judge's conclusion in this case that Applicant's two statements are reconcilable is sustainable even if the record
evidence also lends itself to other plausible interpretations.</P>

<P>Department Counsel's argument that the Administrative Judge shifted the burden of proof to Department Counsel relies on the
premise that Department Counsel had already established its prima facie case (The Directive requires Department Counsel to
establish controverted facts, see Enclosure 3, E3.1.14.)  In the instant case that means that Department Counsel was required to 
prove that Applicant had falsified one of his statements.  Then the burden would indeed be on Applicant to mitigate or extenuate
his conduct.  However, in this case Applicant's statements were not proven to be falsifications according to the Administrative
Judge.  Therefore, Department Counsel had not established to the Judge's satisfaction the controverted fact which was the lynchpin
of its prima facie case.  Thus, Department Counsel had not met its initial burden of proof and there was no burden on Applicant to
be shifted back to Department Counsel.</P>

<P>2. Was the Administrative Judge's decision arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law?  Department Counsel argues that it was
arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law for the Administrative Judge to find that Applicant had not taken classified information
home after he admitted that it was "possible" he may have done so.  The Board does not agree.</P>

<P>The differences between Applicant's prior statements were explained to the Administrative Judge's satisfaction at the hearing.  In
reviewing those statements, the Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's speculation about the possibility that he may
have inadvertently taken FOUO and confidential documents home was insufficient to establish the fact that he had indeed taken
classified documents home.  This conclusion was reasonable considering no additional evidence exists in the record to establish
that Applicant had taken classified materials home.  While Department Counsel presents a plausible alternative interpretation of
the evidence, the Administrative Judge's finding is a reasonable interpretation of the evidence he had before him.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Department Counsel has failed to meet its burden on appeal of demonstrating harmful error.  Therefore, the Administrative Judge's
September 7, 2000 decision is affirmed.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Separate opinion of Chairman Emilio Jaksetic, concurring:</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Under the Directive: (a) the Board does not have the authority to conduct <EM>de novo</EM> review of a case on appeal; (b) the Board must
give deference to the credibility determinations made by an Administrative Judge; and (c) there is no presumption of error below
and the appealing party has the burden of demonstrating the Administrative Judge erred.  Constrained by the limits of my
authority under the Directive, I concur with my colleagues' conclusion that Department Counsel has failed to meet its burden of
demonstrating the Judge erred.</P>
