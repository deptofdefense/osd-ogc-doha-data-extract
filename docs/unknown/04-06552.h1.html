<P>Applicant failed to mitigate personal conduct allegation for failure to report on his SF 86 a 1995 arrest for drug use and possession and an alcohol/drug related 
driving offense. Applicant's security interviewer had provided an opportunity to him to offer any new information to correct the SF 86 and to change the draft 
statement. He declined to do so. Applicant's signed sworn statement admitted that omission was because of a fear that to do so would be prejudicial to 
obtaining a security clearance. so. Clearance is denied. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On May 6, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security</EM> <EM>Clearance Review Program 
</EM>(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.</P> 
<P>On May 18, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on June 20, 2005. A notice of hearing 
was issued on July 18, 2005, for a hearing on August 4, 2005, and held that day. Applicant acknowledged that he had received two weeks oral notice. The 
government offered four exhibits into evidence and Applicant offered one. All were accepted. Four witnesses testified for Applicant.The transcript was received 
on August 17, 2005. The record was left open for submission of additional material until September 19, 2005 and one additional document was submitted 
within that time and accepted in evidence.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant denied all SOR allegations. After a complete review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 3l-year-old employee of a defense contractor performing computer services since June, 2003, when he filed a security clearance application (SF 
86). He also works in an office supply store managing logistics as a second job. </P> 
<P>In 1995 in a mid-western state where Applicant was raised and lived with his mother, who was divorced, he was charged with two drug-related charges 
concerning use and possession of marijuana, and two traffic-related offences concerning driving under the influence of liquor/drugs, and lane straddling. He 
pled guilty to a lesser charge of reckless driving and was fined $322.00. The two drug charges were dismissed.  </P> 
<P>After the 1995 arrest, Applicant realized he was associating with the wrong crowd and needed to change his entire environment. He contacted his father, told 
him of his problems, and asked if he could move in with him on the East coast. He did so and has changed his life-style, does not use drugs, and drinks 
moderately. He is engaged to be married to a young woman he met five years ago at his private employment who is in college studying psychological 
counseling. </P> 
<P>Applicant did not list the charges in answer to Question 24 on his SF 86 relating to his police record for alcohol/drug offenses as he was required to do. During 
his interview with the Defense Security Service investigator on March 17, 2004, he signed a statement saying he did not disclose the information on the SF 86 
or to the investigator until he was confronted about it because he was afraid he would not be granted a security clearance (Exh. 4). The investigator had given 
him an opportunity at the beginning of the interview to voluntarily offer any additional information that he might have forgotten. Applicant declined to do so. </P> 
<P>Applicant is well regarded by his supervisor at his private employment (TR. 41-44), and has good ratings for work and attendance at his defense contractor 
employer (Exh. A and B). He is now in a stable environment living with another young man, engaged to be married, and has a solid relationship with his father 
(TR. 22-39).</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.</P> 
<P>An evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of 
the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of 
the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearances are 
granted only when "it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Executive Order No. 10865 &sect; 2. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of 
the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant 
then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. "Any doubt as to whether 
access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security." Directive, &para; E2.2.2. "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials." <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. <EM>See </EM>Executive Order No. 12968 &sect; 3.1(b).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's failure to report his police record for alcohol/drug offenses at Question 24 on his SF 86 raises issues under Guideline E that might indicate 
questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard 
classified information (E2.A5.1.1.). Specifically, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security 
application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. (E2.A5.1.2.2.) Applicant's failure to report the offenses was deliberate by his own statement that 
he feared if he did so it might jeopardize his ability to obtain a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant raised certain issues at the hearing relating to his statement to the investigator saying that he did not intend to deceive and that he did not tell the 
investigator of his intent to deceive to obtain a clearance. However, he did admit that he read the statement, albeit hurriedly, and that he signed it with the 
statement included making no effort to get it changed. No mitigating conditions apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is alleged both as a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001 by failing to answer question 24 (SOR &para;2.a) and as to the conduct itself (SOR 
&para;2.b). The allegations could be mitigated if the criminal behavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1), the crime was an isolated incident (E2.A10.1.3.2.), or there is 
clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (E2.A10.1.3.6.). I conclude that 2 b is mitigated for all three conditions. However, I find that &para;2.a is not mitigated 
because of the existence of the signed statement admitting that the omission was deliberate and for the purpose of deceiving. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant has a promising future with his 
employer and his enterprise in holding two jobs is commendable. He took his life in hand, made changes, and self-corrected the direction he was heading. He 
has built a solid relationship with his fianc&eacute;, and his father has provided pivotal guidance for him. The case is unfortunate since, but for the SF 86 omission, the 
government likely would not have pressed the case since the underlying offense was ten years old. However, I must consider the fact that the evidence includes 
a sworn statement admitting a serious deceit in not only failing to report the 1995 arrest but doing so for the purpose of deceiving. Applicant read the statement 
before signing it and had an opportunity to request changes if it was inaccurate. He did not do so. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After considering all the evidence in its totality, including the whole person of Applicant, I conclude it is premature to grant him a security clearance.</SPAN></P>
