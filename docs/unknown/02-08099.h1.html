<P>Applicant, a 53-year old deputy program manager for a defense contractor, was convicted of a single drug-related felony charge in 1973, and later sentenced to 
four years imprisonment (suspended in favor of probation).  Applicant's conduct is covered by the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986), which bars persons 
sentenced to more than one year of incarceration, regardless of time actually served, from ever holding a security clearance, absent a meritorious basis for an 
exception.  Applicant completed his probation and went on to complete his college education and have a successful employment career.  Clearance is denied, 
but I<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On March 20, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals, pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR in May 2003 (undated) and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on July 7, 2003, and was  
scheduled for hearing on September 9, 2003.  A hearing was convened on September 9, 2003, as scheduled, for the purpose of considering whether it would be 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of 
four exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and four exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on September 25, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF FACTS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 53-year old deputy program manager engineer for a defense contractor who seeks to retain the security clearance that he has held since 1988.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Summary of Allegations and Responses</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J, Applicant is alleged to have been arrested in November 1973 for possession of heroin, sentenced to four years in jail (sentence suspended), 
and placed on probation.  By virtue of the provisions of the Smith Amendment's (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986), Applicant is subject to the mandatory clearance bar of 
the Smith Amendment, save for the availability of a waiver by the Secretary of Defense on a showing of meritorious circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth and provided no explanations.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Relevant and Material Factual Findings</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations in the SOR as admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference  and are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional 
findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>While driving home from work in 1973, Applicant was stopped by police; he and his car were searched.  Police found drugs in a jacket lying in the back seat of 
Applicant's vehicle, which his younger brother had been wearing earlier in the morning (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3; R.T., at 24-26).  Applicant's younger brother was not in the 
vehicle when Applicant was stopped.  Police at the scene told Applicant they believed the drugs were his, since they were found in a jacket located in 
Applicant's vehicle.  Following his arrest, he was taken to a local police station, where he was held for about a week before he was released on bail (<EM>see</EM> ex. 3).</P> 
 
<P>At his arraignment following his 1973 arrest, Applicant appeared without an attorney, He pleaded guilty to the heroin possession charge (a felony) on the 
promise of a probation recommendation from prosecutors (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 27).  His younger brother never appeared to claim the drugs found in Applicant's vehicle 
were his (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 34-35).  Applicant was found guilty of the heroin possession charge and sentenced to four years incarceration, all of which were 
suspended.  Applicant was placed on four years probation (ex. 3).</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's probation conditions included his participation in a narcotics addiction program, which required him to submit to regular urinalysis testing, and any 
other tests for narcotics and dangerous drug offenders that the program's officials might request (<EM>see</EM> ex. 4).  For the first six weeks of his probation, Applicant 
was drug tested daily.   Thereafter, he was tested once a week for five weeks and once a month for the duration of his probation (<EM>see</EM> R.T., at 27).  All of his 
tests were negative.  Applicant completed his probation conditions in satisfactory manner by 1978 and was discharged from any further probation conditions.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has three children from his second marriage: one in college, one in high school, and one in middle school.  He also has three children from his first 
marriage.  Since joining his current defense contractor, he has completed his educational requirements for a bachelors of arts degree at a local university (<EM>see</EM> ex. 
D).  Applicant is highly regarded by his managers and co-workers as a deputy program manager who can always be trusted and relied on to give his best effort.  
His work is considered exceptional and critical to a weapon system he is responsible for developing for DoD (<EM>see</EM> exs. A and B).  His company manager 
describes Applicant "as an outstanding employee and family man," whose "struggle to clear his name exemplifies his character" (<EM>see</EM> ex. A).  His company's 
president bestows strong  praise, too: "He has always given 120% for all he has to both his family and the job" (<EM>see </EM>ex. A).  High praise for Applicant's 
trustworthiness and reliability is similarly extended by co-workers who provide written character references for him (<EM>see</EM> Ex. A).</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>In addition to adjudicating Smith Amendment cases in accordance with current Executive Order and DoD Directive/Regulatory guidance, including applicable 
due process procedures, the criteria provide for consideration of issues covered by provisions 1 and 4 of the Act without consideration of the statute.  This is for 
the purpose of developing as complete a record as possible to aid the responsible authority for making a recommendation to the Secretary of  Defense as to 
whether the case merits a waiver. </P> 
 
<P>Revised Adjudicative Guidelines designed to implement the provisions of the Smith Amendment and supplement existing Adjudicative Guidelines<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> for 
assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E2.2 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive have been developed.  These revised Guidelines are intended to assist the 
judges in  reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision of security clearance eligibility.</SPAN>  E2.2 considerations comprise the following: the nature, extent 
and seriousness of the conduct, the circumstances surrounding the conduct, the frequency and recency of the conduct, the individual's age and maturity at the 
time of the conduct, the voluntariness of participation, the presence or absence of rehabilitation, the motivation for the conduct, the potential for pressure, 
coercion, or duress, and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy guidelines are pertinent herein:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgement, reliability and trustworthiness.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC a  Allegations or admission of criminal conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC b  A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC c   <STRONG>Conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions:</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC a  The criminal behavior was not recent.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC b  The crime was an isolated incident.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC f  There is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC g   <STRONG>Potentially disqualifying conditions c. and d., above, may not be mitigated unless, where meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretary of 
Defense or the Secretary of the Military Department concerned has granted a waiver.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold 
finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in 
the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that 
evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  
Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing on the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of materiality, however, does 
not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a 
security clearance.  Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a highly regarded deputy program manager who as a young man was arrested and charged with possession of heroin found in a coat pocket in his 
car.  Unable to persuade his brother to come forward and claim the heroin as his own, Applicant pleaded guilty to the heroin possession charge and was 
sentenced to four years of incarceration.  That Applicant was placed on four years probation by the sentencing court in lieu of incarceration does not alter or 
change the legal force of the four year sentence for purposes of applying the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. Sec. 986) to the facts of this case.  For over ten 
years, </SPAN> Applicant has continued to impress his company's management staff with his technical abilities and dedicated effort.  Applicant is by all credible 
accounts fully rehabilitated and an exemplary role model in his work, community and home.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Independent consideration of Smith Amendment related-conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>By reliance on otherwise applicable mitigating conditions, Applicant's underlying actions leading to his 1973 heroin possession conviction could be considered 
dated and the result of youthful immaturity, and sufficient to warrant the benefit of revised Adjudicative Guidelines MC a (criminal behavior not recent) and 
C f (there is clear evidence of rehabilitation) as well as overall favorable consideration taking into account the E.2.2 factors.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's satisfaction of his probation conditions and personal and work accomplishments  are persuasive evidence of his increased maturity, reliability and 
trust.  His achievements begin with his strong family background (to include his raising six children, with one currently in college) and encompass both his 
educational pursuits with an accredited local university and his outstanding work achievements.  Applicant's company contributions and the trust and reliance 
he has inspired among his management team and co-workers is impressive and heavily documented in the record.  His work is considered by his management to 
be exceptional and critical to a weapon system he is responsible for developing for DoD. </P> 
 
<P>Without consideration of the Smith Amendment, Applicant's impressive post-release rehabilitation efforts would be enough to enable safe predictive judgments 
about his overall judgment, reliability and trustworthiness requisite for holding a security clearance entitling him to continued access to classified information.  
Because a pre-Smith Amendment assessment is advisory only, however, any formal finding that follows from this advisory assessment must necessarily take 
into account the Smith Amendment and its exception that permits a consideration of a waiver of the mandatory clearance bar, which only the Secretary of 
Defense can grant in contractor cases (as here).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Application of Smith Amendment</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As the result of Applicant's state felony conviction and imposed four year sentence  (<EM>see </EM>sub-paragraph 1.c), his actions fall within the coverage of the Smith 
Amendment's provision 1.  Cases that may otherwise be decided in favor of an applicant must, nonetheless, be decided unfavorably because of the Smith 
Amendment's mandatory bar where applicable.  Under the adjudicative guidelines implementing the Smith Amendment, Applicant's time in rehabilitation, 
while very encouraging, still cannot free him from coverage of the Amendments's mandatory bar, absent a waiver.  On the strength of the Smith Amendment's 
mandatory lifetime disqualification of applicants whose conduct (like Applicant's) is found to be covered by the Smith Amendment,  risk absolving mitigation 
is  available to Applicant only by virtue of MC g of the revised guidelines (no mitigation of potentially disqualifying conditions, except by demonstration of 
sufficiently meritorious circumstances to justify the granting of a waiver by the Secretary of  Defense.</P> 
 
<P>Independent consideration of the mitigating conditions developed for assessing a  provision 1 situation falling under the Smith Amendment warrants further 
consideration of a waiver in this case in accordance with MC g of the revised guidelines.  Unfavorable conclusions are called for with respect to the allegations 
covered by sub-paragraphs 1.a and 1.b by virtue of the <EM>per se </EM>requirements of the Smith Amendment, subject to consideration of a meritorious waiver.. </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the factors set forth in the Procedures section (paragraph 6) of the 
Directive, as well as E.2.2 of the </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the same Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of the FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the 
factors listed above, this Administrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">GUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):   AGAINST APPLICANT</SPAN></P>
