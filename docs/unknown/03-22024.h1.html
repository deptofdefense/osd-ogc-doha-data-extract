<P>Applicant's financial problems continue to raise security concerns over his failure to resolve $34,000 in debt owed to ten creditors.  The record evidence is

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On November 10, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="03-22024.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Security 
concerns were raised under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  DOHA recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether 
a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 3, 2004, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On January 10, 2005, I was assigned the case. On March 11, 2005, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing which was held on March 30, 2005. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. 
Several documents were received and admitted into the record as Applicant's Exhibit (App Ex) D.  On April 8, 2005, DOHA received a copy of the transcript 
(Tr.).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits owing seven of the 13 debts listed in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">That admission is incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the entire record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 51 year old logistics specialist who has worked for a defense contractor since October 1989, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. 
Applicant's duty performance has been regarded as exemplary.  His supervisors described him as  a competent performer and a valued team player. (App Ex 
A) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Prior to 1996, Applicant had no financial delinquencies.  In December 1997, his mother died and in 1997 his dog died. He was emotionally distraught and 
spent a lot of time and money visiting bars and clubs. (Gov Ex 2 at  3.)  He allowed his bills to go unpaid.  In 1997 and 1998, he received grief counseling and 
sought the services of a debt consolidation agency. The agency recommended he file for bankruptcy protection.  He read books about resolving credit 
problems. After studying his options, Applicant declined to file for bankruptcy protection. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During 1998, Applicant paid three debtors and decided not to pay his other debtor then or in the future. It was his intent to have them removed from his credit 
report after seven years. Applicant asserts four of the debts (SOR paragraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.g and 1.l) are more than seven years old.  He provided no 
documentation supporting this assertion. As of May 2003, he had $500 per month in disposable income. In 1998, he stopped getting telephone calls from the 
creditors.  In 2001, mail from his past due creditors tapered off. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 2000, he separated from his second wife.  They were divorced in early 2001. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2003, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent and asked about his finances. At that time, he agreed ten debts 
were his. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In December 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR and indicated that for seven of the listed debts, "Payment plan is in work." At the hearing, no evidence of 
a repayment plan was presented. Following the hearing, Applicant sought the services of a debt management company.  Two of the debts ($3,917, SOR 
paragraph 1.f and $4,924.84, SOR paragraph 1.h) were included in the plan which requires Applicant to pay $217 per month for 48 months. No documentation 
of payment to the company or from the company to creditors was provided.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's August 2004 credit report (Gov Ex 4) lists three charged-off accounts ($547, SOR paragraph 1.b; $9,556, SOR paragraph 1.c; $3,135, SOR 1.g) 
and five collection accounts ($2,962, SOR paragraph 1.d; $4,414, SOR paragraph 1.e; $3,917, SOR paragraph 1.f; $4,747, SOR paragraph 1.h; $1,981, SOR 
paragraph 1.k).  In his May 2003 sworn statement, Applicant admits owing the creditors in SOR 1.a, 1.c, 1.i, 1.l, and 1.m.  Applicant's August 2004 credit 
report indicates the debts owed in 1.a and 1.m had been transferred or sold. A summary of the 13 debts listed in the SOR follows:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Disqualifying Conditions 
(DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense 
decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The 
adjudicative guidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent 
with the interests of national security. The presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative of a conclusion 
for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. 
Considering the evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"> </SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant. Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which 
disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is 
something less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial 
evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances which indicate an 
applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness 
required of persons handling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Once the government 
has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case. Additionally, an applicant has 
the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-22024.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), "no one has a 'right' to a security clearance." A 
person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant's suitability for 
access to classified information to be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. A person's relationship with his creditors is a private 
matter until evidence is uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating 
or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding 
of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. An applicant 
who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Directive E.2.A.6.1.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits owing nine debts totaling approximately $31,763 and admitted in his May 2003 sworn statement to owing another creditor $1,981. The ten 
debts total approximately $34,000. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1 <EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations</EM>) and 3 (E2.A6.1.2.3 <EM>Inability 
or unwillingness to satisfy debts</EM>) apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the late 1990s, Applicant experienced two losses which caused him to be emotionally distraught.  He spent time and money visiting bars and allowed his 
bills to go unpaid.  In 1998, he made the decision to pay three debtors and not pay his other debtor then or in the future.  It was his intent to have them removed 
from his credit report after seven years. Applicant has paid one debt ($547, SOR paragraph 1.b) and there is no evidence he owes two other debts ($222, SOR 
paragraph 1.i; SOR paragraph 1.j).  I find for Applicant as to these three debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the Mitigating Conditions (MC) apply in the Applicant's favor to the remaining ten debts. MC 1 (E2.A6.1.2.1</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The behavior was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not 
apply because the conduct is recent since the debts remain unpaid. MC 2 (E2.A6.1.2.2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> It was an isolated incident</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) does not apply because there are ten debts. 
There was no showing the debts were caused by factors beyond Applicant's control. In early 2001, Applicant divorced his second wife. However, he failed to 
substantiate the impact of the divorce on his finances. He has been employed with the same company for 15 years. As of May 2003, Applicant had $500 per 
month of disposable income.  There is no showing he paid his past due debts with this income. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant has read books about finances and twice sought the services of a debt consolidation firm, once in the late 1990s and again following the 
hearing, there has been no showing Applicant's financial difficulties are under control. Therefore, MC4 (E2.A6.1.3.4 <EM>The person has received or is receiving 
counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control</EM>) does not apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For MC 6 (E2.A6.1.2.6</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) to apply there must be an "ability" to 
repay the debts, the "desire" to repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling his debts is needed, which is not 
present here. Following the hearing, Applicant did seek the services of a credit consolidation firm.  However, there is no evidence Applicant ever sent the firm 
any payment nor is there evidence of the firm making payment to a creditor. Seeking the services of the firm is not equivalent to a demonstrated track record of 
financial reform and rehabilitation. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the debts remain unpaid and there is no showing of payments have been made in accord with the debt management agreement on the two debts 
included in it, I find against Applicant as to financial considerations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 
the circumstances surrounding the conduct; Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency and recency 
of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or 
conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
