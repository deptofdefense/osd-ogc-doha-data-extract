<P>The Applicant was a dual US Israeli citizen. She has surrendered her foreign passport and her foreign citizenship has been revoked.  The Applicant's sister and 
mother-in-law are citizens of and living in foreign countries and her husband and children are dual Israeli-US citizens.  However, her husband has surrendered 
his foreign passport and has initiated action to renounce his foreign citizenship.  None of her relatives are agents of a foreign power or in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 13, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-17496.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On December 
20, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on January 28, 2002.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
February 8, 2002, scheduling the hearing which was held on February 27, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's case consisted of five exhibits (Gov Ex).  The Applicant relied on her own testimony. Following the hearing, four additional documents were 
received, provisions having been made at the time of the hearing for their submission following the hearing.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department counsel having no objection to their 
admission, the submissions were admitted as </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">applicant's exhibits (App Ex).  A translation of the final exhibit was received on April 24, 2001.  The transcript 
(tr.) of the hearing was received on March 5, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges foreign preference (Guideline C) and foreign influence (Guideline B). The Applicant denies the allegations. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 48 years old, has worked for a federal contractor since July 1996, and is seeking a security clearance.  She was born in Uzbekistan, at age five 
moved to Poland, and at age 13 moved to Israel where she became an Israeli citizen.  She lived in Israel from 1966 until 1984.  The Applicant served two years 
of compulsory service--between the ages of 18 and 20--with the Israeli army serving as a secretary.  Following her military service she attended college paid 
for by her father.  While in school, she worked at the student union answering telephones.  She has worked in Israel for a laboratory company testing soil 
samples and for a road construction company designing roads and conducting surveys.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">From 1984 until 1987, she lived in the US with her husband who was obtaining his Ph.D.  Upon his graduation, they returned to Israel.  From 1987 until 1989, 
the Applicant lived in Israel working for a drafting company.  In May 1989, she and her husband returned to the US with their two children all of whom are dual 
US-Israeli citizens.  Her children are currently exempted from serving in the Israeli military.  In February 1999, she and her husband became naturalized US 
citizens. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While living in Israel, the Applicant owned an apartment, which she has since sold.  She also sold her mother's apartment following her mother's death.  The 
Applicant owns no real estate in Israel, has no bank accounts or other financial assets there. She is not entitled to a retirement, pension, educational benefits, or 
social welfare benefits from Israel, and has no expectation of inheritance there.  She sends no money to any foreign relative.  The Applicant and her husband 
own a home in the US worth approximately $400,000.00.  They have bank accounts in the US of approximately $40,000.00 and 401(k) retirement accounts of 
$100,000.00.  The Applicant has not voted in any US election or foreign election since becoming a US citizen. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since coming to the US, the Applicant has worked for a real estate company and for a defense contractor.  The Applicant choice is to live in the US and her 
loyalties are with the US, (Gov Ex 3) which is why she chose to become a US citizen. (tr. 28)  When asked how she would react if her family members were 
ever to be threatened, she stated she did not know what she would do. Not knowing does not mean she would choose to go against the US. (tr. 23)  Her 
uncertainty is not unique to relatives living abroad for she see the threat can occur to anyone living anywhere. (tr. 54) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1976, the Applicant obtained an Israeli passport, which she has since renewed several times. The passport was most recent extension was November 2001 to 
expired on January 21, 2006.  In February 1999, the Applicant obtained a US passport which she has used for all travel except when visiting Israel.  In January 
2002, on her most recent visit to Israel, the Applicant present both her US and Israeli passports upon arrival and was told she must use her Israeli passport to 
enter and leave Israel. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence issued guidance clarifying the application of 
the Foreign Preference adjudicative guideline.  The ASDC3I memo states any clearance must be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign 
passport or obtains approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States government.  When the Applicant became aware of the memo she took 
immediate steps to surrender her foreign passport to the foreign embassy. (App Ex A)  On 1 March 2002, the Applicant surrendered her Israeli passport to the 
Israeli embassy (App Ex A) and was informed to surrender her passport she had to renounce her Israeli citizenship.  On April 9, 2002, her Israeli citizenship 
was renounced.  Her husband also surrendered his passport and has taken action to renounce his Israeli citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's sister is an Israeli citizen living in Israel.  Her sister and brother-in-law are pharmacists who have two children, one is a student and the other is 
a graphic artist who is an art school teacher. (tr. 49-50)  The Applicant talks with her sister by telephone weekly talking approximately 40 minutes per call. (tr. 
57)  The Applicant sends no presents or cards to her sister or nephews.  The Applicant's mother-in-law -- age 83-- is also an Israeli citizen living in Israel and 
is a retired cashier.  The Applicant talks with her mother-in-law approximately 15 minutes once or twice a week by telephone.  The Applicant sends no presents 
or cards to her mother-in-law. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines in the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure.  Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward making determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  In making overall common sense 
determinations, Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable and unfavorable, not only with respect to the 
relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, but in the context of factors set forth in section E 2.2.1. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not only has the 
burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also demonstrate the facts proven have a nexus to an Applicant's lack of security 
worthiness.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance 
is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Preference (Guideline C)</STRONG>The Concern:  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, 
then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  1.  The exercise of dual citizenship.  E2.A3.1.2.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  2.  Possession and/or use of a foreign passport.  E2.A3.1.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  Dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  E2.A3.1.3.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  2.  Indicators of possible foreign preference (e.g., foreign military service) occurred before obtaining United States citizenship.  E2.A3.1.3.2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  4.  Individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  E2.A3.1.3.4. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Foreign Influence (Guideline B) </STRONG> The Concern:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to 
whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial 
interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country. E2.A2.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are 
not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States. E2.A2.1.3.1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  3.  Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent. E2.A2.1.3.3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets that burden, the 
burden of persuasion then shifts to the Applicant who must remove that doubt and establish her security suitability with substantial evidence in explanation, 
mitigation, extenuation, or refutation, sufficient to demonstrate that despite the existence of guideline conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant or continue her security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the 
facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), 
"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge 
understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be resolved against the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  Under Guideline C, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when the person acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the US.  Security concerns over the Applicant's 
possible foreign preference arise from her exercise of dual citizenship. Although the Applicant was born in Uzbekistan, she became an Israeli citizen and lived 
in Israel from 1966 until 1984.  The Applicant has completed two years of compulsory service with the Israeli army, which occurred before she became a 
naturalized US citizen.  Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="01-17496.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After become a US citizen she presented both her US and Israeli passport when she visited Israel and was told she had to use her Israeli passport to enter the 
country.  Since becoming a US citizen in February 1999, her only use of the Israeli passport was to visit Israel. Because she possessed and used a foreign 
passport, DC 2<A HREF="01-17496.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence issued guidance clarifying the application of 
the Foreign Preference adjudicative guideline.  The ASDC3I memo states any clearance must be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign 
passport or obtains approval for its use from the appropriate agency of the United States government.  When the Applicant became aware of the ASDC3I memo 
she immediately surrendered her foreign passport to the foreign embassy and started the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship.  On April 2, 2002, her 
foreign citizenship was revoked.  Actually revoking her foreign citizenship is stronger then MC 4<A HREF="01-17496.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> which only requires a willingness to do so.  MC 4 applies.  I 
find for the Applicant as to Foreign Preference (Guideline C) SOR subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline B, (Foreign Influence).  Under Guideline B, the security eligibility of an applicant is 
placed into question when the person has immediate family members or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection are citizens of and/or 
residing in a foreign country. A security risk may exist where the Applicant is bound by affection, influence, or obligation to individuals who are not citizens of 
the United States or may be subject to duress. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's mother-in-law and sister are Israeli citizens living there. The Applicant has weekly telephone communication with each of them, but sends 
them no cards or presents.  Her mother-in-law is a retired cashier.  Her sister and her husband are pharmacists.  The Applicant's mother-in-law and sister are not 
agents of a foreign power nor are they in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
persons involved and the United States.  MC 1<A HREF="01-17496.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and MC 3<A HREF="01-17496.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> apply.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.c. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's husband, son, and daughter are dual Israeli-US citizens.  Her husband has surrendered his Israeli passport and has started the procedure to 
renounce his foreign citizenship. None of them work for a foreign government.  All of them live in the US.  MC1 applies.  I find for the Applicant as to SOR 
subparagraph 2.b. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is uncertain as to how she would react if her relatives were to be threatened which is not limited simply to those living abroad.  Her uncertainty 
does not mean she would act against the US, it merely means she is uncertain what she would do.  She has honestly answered she cannot predict her reaction to 
a future event, but would not go against the US.  The Applicant's uncertainty about a possible event will not be held against her.  MC 1 applies.  I find for the 
Applicant as to SOR subparagraph 2.d. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct; the Applicant's voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the 
circumstance or conduct will continue or recur in the future. </SPAN></P>
