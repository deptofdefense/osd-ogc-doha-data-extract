<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On August 11, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) 
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 26, 2006, after the hearing,  
Administrative Judge Charles D. Ablard granted Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; 
E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge's favorable clearance decision under Guidelines E and J is 
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  We reverse the Administrative Judge's decision to grant the clearance.</P> 
 
<P>   </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Factual Findings</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>A.  The Administrative Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working in the communications field where he has been successfully employed since 1981 
holding a security clearance.  He was on active duty in enlisted status in the Army from 1974 until 1981 and since in the reserves with a security clearance. He 
has held a clearance for over 30 years with no security violations. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's criminal offense alleged in SOR &para;2.b. occurred in 1998 when he was having financial difficulties. He received a traffic citation with a fine of 
$130.00, but he paid only $80.00 by creating a new citation and changing the numbers. He was charged with forgery, but the charge was reduced to disorderly 
conduct to which he pled guilty in 1999.  He was sentenced to 25 hours of community service and fined $250.00.</P> 
 
<P>Three different security clearance applications (SF 86) were submitted in evidence.  The first dated August 29, 2002, is an abbreviated form omitting questions 
8 through 11 and 17 through 42. The second is dated August 29, 2003, and includes answers to those omitted questions. These included Question 26 on arrests 
during the past seven years to which Applicant answered in the negative.  This is the basis for the personal conduct allegation in SOR &para;1.a. The third is dated 
July 13, 2000, and contains similar information, but also includes the information at Question 26 about the 1999 conviction for disorderly conduct. </P> 
 
<P>There is confusion concerning the origins of these SF 86s. Applicant submitted a letter from his company attempting to explain the existence of the three 
documents and the origins of the requests for the documents. Since both the first and second documents are dated the same month and day but with different 
years, the government contended that they likely were both from the 2002 submission.  Thus, the two were treated as being from 2002.  Despite the confusion, 
Applicant did omit the relevant information for Question 26 on the full 2002 SF86 even though he had included the information on his 2000 SF 86. He 
admitted that he did not want to disclose it for fear of jeopardizing his employment although he couldn't understand why since he had revealed the same 
information two years before. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was divorced in 1998 and has been financially responsible for his two children from the marriage. His son is a Ph.D. candidate at a mid-western 
university and his daughter is an adult practical nurse who lives with him. He has another daughter out of wedlock, age 15, whose mother has cancer. He is 
bringing their daughter to live with him. He has maintained contact with the daughter and her mother over the past 15 years taking his parental responsibilities 
seriously. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is well regarded by his company based on his performance evaluations.  He had an excellent record in the Army while on active duty as shown by his 
evaluations and by his Army Reserve supervisors over the past five years of his service in the reserves. During his Reserve career, he has become a warrant 
officer and is expected to be promoted to WO6 in July, 2006. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's salary from his employment is $67,000.00 per annum and he receives approximately $10,000.00 to $13,000.00 per annum for his reserve activities.  
He is financially stable and has none of the problems that existed in 1998. </P> 
 
<P>B.  Discussion</P> 
 
<P>The Judge's findings of fact will be discussed insofar as they relate to the issues presented.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Whether the Record Supports the Administrative Judge's Ultimate Conclusions</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge is required to "examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for" the decision "including a 'rational connection 
between the facts found and the choice made.'" <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </EM>463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) 
(quoting <EM>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States,</EM> 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge's decision to grant, 
deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.  Our scope of review under this standard is narrow, 
and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Administrative Judge.  We may not set aside an Administrative Judge's decision "that is rational, based 
on consideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the agency. . ."  <EM>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n,</EM> 463 U.S. at 42.  We 
review matters of law <EM> de novo.</EM></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel argues that the Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance decision is arbitrary and capricious, and unsupported by the weight of 
the record in its ultimate conclusion that the Guideline J and E security concerns were mitigated.  In support of this argument, Department Counsel contends the 
Judge erred in his favorable application of Guideline J Mitigating Conditions 1, 2 and 6<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> by engaging in a piecemeal analysis of the Guideline J concerns.  
Department Counsel also contends the Judge erred in his favorable application of the "whole person" factors to both the Guideline J and E concerns either by 
relying on factors which did not constitute evidence of changed circumstances or rehabilitation, or failing to consider significant aspects of the case and 
articulate a sustainable rationale for his decision.  Department Counsel's argument has merit.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, there were two incidents of falsification-related conduct occurring within a four year period--Applicant's 1999 forgery/disorderly conduct incident 
and his 2002 falsification of his security clearance application.  The Administrative Judge essentially considered them separately, concluding that the 1999 
incident alone was mitigated under Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, and 6 because the incident was isolated, not recent, and the Applicant had demonstrated 
rehabilitation--despite the occurrence of the subsequent similar event.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The Judge's piecemeal analysis of the two episodes failed to reflect a reasonable 
interpretation of the full evidentiary record, which showed a pattern of intentional falsifications, dishonest conduct, and failure to cooperate. <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR 
Case No. 03-22563 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006).  By analyzing each incident, one at a time, the Judge failed to consider the significance of Applicant's pattern 
of conduct.  <EM>See, e.g., Raffone v. Adams,</EM> 468 F. 2d 860 (2<SUP>nd</SUP> Cir. 1972)(taken together, separate events may have a significance that is missing when each event 
is viewed in isolation).  The Judge's favorable application of Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, and 6 under Guideline J is contrary to the weight of the evidence, and 
arbitrary and capricious.  <EM>See, e.g., </EM>ISCR Case No. 99-0122 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 7, 2000).    </P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's favorable application of the "whole person" factors under both Guidelines J and E is similarly flawed.  This case involved multiple 
incidents of serious misconduct of security concern by a mature applicant who had held a clearance for over 30 years.  It was not a case involving a youthful 
indiscretion.  Applicant had deliberately and intentionally engaged in the misconduct, motivated by his own self interest.  The conduct involved multiple 
incidents of falsifying government-type documents.  The most recent falsification had occurred in 2002 and had not been corrected by the Applicant until 2004.  
Given those circumstances, the Judge failed to articulate a sustainable rationale for his favorable application of such "whole person" factors as those relating to 
the nature and seriousness of the conduct, the circumstances surrounding the conduct, including the Applicant's knowledgeable participation, the frequency and 
recency of the conduct, the Applicant's age and maturity at the time of the conduct, the voluntariness of Applicant's participation, the motivation for the 
conduct, and the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of the conduct.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  In reaching his favorable decision, the Judge pointed to such factors as Applicant's 
successful career, his strong family support, and his expression of contrition, to support a conclusion of changed circumstances and rehabilitation.  However, 
most of those circumstances were also present prior to, or during, the time Applicant engaged in the conduct of security concern, and the others are either of 
low probative value or standing alone insufficient to support the Judge's favorable conclusion, given the extent of the unanalyzed contrary evidence.  
Accordingly, the Judge's favorable application of the "whole person" factors under Guidelines J and E is contrary to the weight of the evidence, and arbitrary 
and capricious.  </P> 
 
<P>The errors identified by Department Counsel are harmful and cannot be remedied on remand, given the Administrative Judge's findings of fact and the record 
in the case.  Therefore, the Judge's favorable decision under Guidelines J and E must be reversed.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>  <STRONG>Order</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge's favorable security clearance is REVERSED.</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER>Separate Opinion of Member Mark W. Harvey</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>I respectfully dissent.  I disagree with my colleagues that reversal is warranted.  The Administrative Judge's decision  was not arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful.  
Even if the Judge erred in the application of three mitigating conditions, the case should be remanded to the Judge to permit him to take corrective action, and 
then to issue a new decision.   </P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel raises two issues on appeal relevant to our disposition:  (1) Whether the Administrative Judge was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law 
in his conclusion that Guideline J, Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, and 6 <A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> applied to Applicant's 1999 forgery and (2) Whether the Judge was arbitrary, capricious, 
or contrary to law in his conclusions with respect to his whole person analysis. </P> 
 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are:  (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive &para; E3.1.32.3.  When considering a Judge's rulings or conclusions under the arbitrary or capricious standard, the Board reviews the 
Judge's decision and determines whether:  "it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a 
rational connection between the facts found and the choice made."<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  We consider whether the Judge's decision, "does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a 
clear error of judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or 
it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion."<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  If an appealing party demonstrates error, then the Board determines whether 
the error is harmful or harmless,<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> whether the Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds,<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and if the  Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, whether 
the case should be reversed or remanded.  ISCR Case No. 04-04008 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2005) (citing Directive &para;&para; E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3)).</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>I. The Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>A. The Judge found the following pertinent facts:</P> 
 
<P>  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working in the communications field where he has been successfully employed since 1981 
holding a security clearance.  He was on active duty in enlisted status in the Army from 1974 until 1981 and since in the reserves with a security clearance. He 
has held a clearance for over 30 years with no security violations. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's criminal offense alleged in [Statement of Reasons] (SOR) &para; 2.b. occurred in 1998 when he was having financial difficulties.  He received a traffic 
citation with a fine of $130.00, but he paid only $80.00 by creating a new citation and changing the numbers. He was charged with forgery, but the charge was 
reduced to disorderly conduct to which he pled guilty in 1999 (Exh. 6). He was sentenced to 25 hours of community service and fined $250.00.</P> 
 
<P>Three different security clearance applications (SF 86) were submitted in evidence.  The first (Exh. 1) dated August 29, 2002, is an abbreviated form omitting 
questions 8 through 11 and 17 through 42.  The second (Exh 2) is dated August 29, 2003, and includes answers to those omitted questions.  These included 
Question 26 on arrests during the past seven years to which Applicant answered in the negative. This is the basis for the personal conduct allegation in SOR &para; 
1.a.  The third (Exh. 3) is dated July 13, 2000, and contains similar information, but also includes the information at Question 26 about the 1999 conviction for 
disorderly conduct. </P> 
 
<P>There is confusion concerning the origins of these SF 86s. Applicant submitted a letter from his company attempting to explain the existence of the three 
documents and the origins of the requests for the documents (Exh. B).  Since both the first and second documents are dated the same month and day but with 
different years, the government contended that they likely were both from the 2002 submission.  Thus, I will treat the two as being from 2002.  Despite the 
confusion, Applicant did omit the relevant information for Question 26 on the full 2002 SF 86 even though he had included the information on his 2000 SF 86.  
He admitted that he did not want to disclose it for fear of jeopardizing his employment although he couldn't understand why since he had revealed the same 
information two years before. </P> 
 
<P>Applicant was divorced in 1998 and has been financially responsible for his two children from the marriage.  His son is a Ph.D. candidate at a mid-western 
university and his daughter is an adult practical nurse who lives with him.  He has another daughter out of wedlock, age 15, whose mother has cancer.  He is 
bringing their daughter to live with him.  He has maintained contact with the daughter and her mother over the past 15 years taking his parental responsibilities 
seriously.  Applicant is well regarded by his company based on his performance evaluations (Exh. E-I).   He had an excellent record in the Army while on 
active duty as shown by his evaluations<SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN>(Exhs. N-T) and by his Army Reserve supervisors (Exhs. D and J-M) over the past five years of his service in the 
reserves.  During his Reserve career, he has become a warrant officer and is expected to be promoted to [CW4] in July, 2006. <SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's salary from his employment is $67,000.00 per annum and he receives approximately $10,000.00 to $13,000.00 per annum for his reserve activities.  
He is financially stable and has none of the problems that existed in 1998. </P> 
 
<P>Decision at 2-3.</P> 
 
<P>B. The Administrative Judge made the following conclusions:</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all 
allegations set forth in the SOR: </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's failure to report his police record for his 1999 conviction at Question 26 on his 2002 SF 86 relating to all other offenses during the past seven years 
raises questions about his personal conduct.  Under Guideline E such conduct might indicate questionable judgment, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations and could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information (E2.A5.1.1.).  Specifically, the deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a personnel security application could raise a security concern and be disqualifying. 
(E2.A5.1.2.2.)  Applicant admitted he deliberately withheld the information, because he feared loss of his security clearance, although [he] could not understand 
why he was concerned since it had been revealed in 2000 without adverse consequences.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) is alleged both as a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001 by failing to answer Question 26 on his 2002 SF 86 (SOR &para; 2.a) and as to the 
conduct itself (SOR &para; 2.b). The allegations could be mitigated if the criminal behavior was not recent (E2.A10.1.3.1), the crime was an isolated incident 
(E2.A10.1.3.2.), or there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation (E2.A10.1.3.6.). I conclude that &para; 2.b is mitigated for all three conditions.</P> 
 
<P>In all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons who have access to classified information have an overriding 
responsibility for the security concerns of the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person's 
trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. </P> 
 
<P>The "whole person" concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions.  Each case must be judged on its own merits taking 
into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.  Applicant has had a successful career with 
the same company for almost a quarter century.  He has been on active duty and in the Army reserves for nearly 30 years where he is highly regarded for his 
skill and dedication to his assignments.  He has successfully held a security clearance for over 30 years.  He has shown strong family support for his older 
children and the care of his younger daughter as well as concern for her mother.  Applicant's expression of remorse both for the criminal conduct and his failure 
to report the occurrence in 2002 on his SF 86 is persuasive of his changed conduct and rehabilitation.  Applying the precepts of the whole person analysis, I 
conclude that Applicant should be granted a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>Decision at 4. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>II.  Whether the Administrative Judge was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in his conclusions that Guideline J, Mitigating Conditions 1, 2, 
and 6 applied with respect to Applicant's 1999 forgery</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that Guideline J, Mitigating Conditions 1 (not recent), 2 (isolated incident) and 6 (clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation) applied to the 1999 forgery incident (SOR &para; 2b), but he apparently did not apply these same mitigation conditions in regard to Applicant's 2002 
false statement on his SF 86 (failure to disclose his prior arrest and conviction) (SOR &para; 2a).</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel contends that the Judge engaged in prohibited piecemeal analysis<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> when he applied these three mitigating conditions to the 1999 forgery 
without considering Applicant's 2002 false statement on his SF 86.  It is apparent, however, from reading the Judge's decision that he did in fact consider both 
incidents in relation to application of these three mitigating conditions, as both incidents are discussed in the same brief paragraph.  The most reasonable 
interpretation of the Judge's overall decision is that he meant to apply all three mitigating conditions to both incidents. </P> 
 
<P>As the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge had to consider the evidence as a whole (including Applicant's explanations), assess the credibility of Applicant's 
testimony, and make appropriate findings of fact.  A Judge "has broad latitude and discretion in writing a decision to decide an applicant's case" and the "Board 
does not have to agree with the Administrative Judge's findings and conclusions" to affirm them.  ISCR Case No. 03-07075 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 2, 2005).</P> 
 
<P>The Directive does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The Judge is required to evaluate the 
record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant's conduct.  ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 
2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)).  In Applicant's case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, 
and the number of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. Accordingly, it would not be arbitrary, 
capricious or unlawful for the Judge to have concluded Applicant's 2002 falsification of his SF 86 was not recent.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>Similarly, the Judge could reasonably conclude that Mitigating Condition 2 ("The crime was an isolated incident") applied to both the 1999 forgery and 2002 
falsification of the SF 86.  A reasonable Judge could consider two incidents, separated from each other by three years to be sufficiently isolated over 
Applicant's nearly three decades of government service to merit application of Mitigating Condition 2.  In his whole person analysis, the Judge explained why 
he believes Applicant is rehabilitated,<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> thus making a reasonable case for Mitigating Condition 6, for both offenses.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Assuming<EM> arguendo</EM>, that the Judge's explicit application of Mitigating Conditions 1, 2 and 6 to the 1999 forgery incident alone was intentional, such decision 
would be arbitrary because he did not "articulate a satisfactory explanation for [his] action including a rational connection between the facts found and the 
choice made."  <EM>State Farm</EM>, 463 U.S. at 43 (quoting <EM>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States</EM>, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962).  Of course, this possibility is 
particularly unlikely in regard to Mitigating Condition 2-because there are only two incidents at issue, and logically a Judge in determining whether an incident 
is isolated or not will always look to the record evidence for other incidents.    </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>III.  Whether the Judge was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in his conclusions with respect to his whole person analysis and whether any 
error was harmless</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel contends that the Judge's reliance upon Applicant's employment history, military service, possession of security clearance, and support of 
his family is misplaced.  Specifically, these circumstances do not show rehabilitation because they did not change after the criminal offenses.   Applicant 
committed two serious offenses.  He did not admit that he lied on his SF 86 until confronted by Special Agent of the Defense Security Service.   Moreover, the 
Judge failed to mention any negative evidence in his whole person analysis.  Department Counsel asserts this analysis "is indicative of the misperception that 
the whole-person analysis is utilized solely for the purposes of mitigation."  Department Counsel provides a lengthy description of aggravating features of the 
nine whole-person factors delineated in the Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 - E2.2.1.9, that the Judge failed to address in his decision.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  All of Department Counsel's 
significant derogatory comments about Applicant can be gleaned from a careful review of the Judge's overall decision, or are inferences that flow from the 
Judge's findings of fact.  Both incidents  pertained to serious legal matters and had serious potential punishments.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.1.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  The two incidents 
were deliberate, willful, premeditated and knowing.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.2 and E2.2.1.5.  There are two incidents, with the most recent in 2002.  Directive &para; 
E2.2.1.3.  At the time of the offenses, Applicant was in his 40s, mature, with a lengthy, stable employment record and decades of military service. Directive &para; 
E2.2.1.4.   Applicant committed both offenses out of self-interest.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.7.  There is an absence of record evidence supporting behavior change. 
Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.6 and E2.2.1.7.  The absence of evidence of widespread knowledge of Applicant's offenses makes him more vulnerable to coercion and 
blackmail.  Directive &para; E2.2.1.8.</P> 
 
<P>The "whole person" concept is the focus of the analysis of whether an applicant is eligible for a security clearance.  Directive &para; E2.2.3.  Indeed, the Appeal 
Board has repeatedly held that a Judge may find in favor of an applicant where no specific mitigating conditions apply.  ISCR Case No. 02-30864 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Oct. 26, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-11448 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-09389 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2004); ISCR Case No. 02-32006 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2004).  "Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant's life 
separately, in a piecemeal manner.  Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant's security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant's conduct and 
circumstances."  ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting  ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2003)).</P> 
 
<P> Under the whole person concept, an Administrative Judge must apply all relevant and material information about an applicant's conduct and circumstances, 
and must not do so in a piecemeal or separate manner.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A>  Whole person analysis is required, and it includes consideration of pertinent Adjudicative Guidelines 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, as well as appropriate information about the applicant, such as age, motivation, and rehabilitative measures, and 
information about the misconduct, such as its nature, seriousness, recency, and frequency. <EM> See </EM>Directive, Section 6.3 and &para;&para; E3.1.25 and E2.2.1; ISCR Case 
No. 02-21927 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 30, 2005).  The obligation to consider these factors "are complementary, not exclusive, in nature." ISCR Case No. 02-09389 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2004).  Then the Judge must decide what weight can reasonably be given to the applicable disqualifying or mitigating condition.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  
Under appropriate circumstances, the Judge can "render a favorable decision in the absence of an[y] Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating condition."<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>I conclude, based on the Judge's decision, that he "considered relevant factors" delineated in the Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 - E2.2.1.9 in his whole person analysis.  
<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (July 14, 1998) (requiring consideration of relevant factors).  His overall decision shows consideration of "record evidence as 
a whole, both favorable and unfavorable."  It  indicates the Judge concluded that "the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence."  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case 
No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (citing Directive &para; E2.A10.1.2.1)).  Having concluded that the Judge's whole person analysis was sustainable, the 
Judge's error, if any was harmless.  </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>IV.  Whether reversal is required to cure this "prejudicial error"</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Remand, rather than reversal, is required for those legal errors that can be corrected on remand.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  Reversal implicitly requires the Board to determine that a 
"Judge's clearance decision is not sustainable and the identified errors cannot be remedied on remand."  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 3 (App. Bd. June 2, 
2006); ISCR Case No. 03-09053 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006).  Remand is consistent with the approach of the Federal Courts.  "The Supreme Court has 
cautioned that when an agency has not considered all relevant factors in taking action, or has provided an insufficient explanation for its action, the appropriate 
course for a reviewing court ordinarily is to remand the case to the agency." <EM> Ward v. Brown</EM>, 22 F.3d 516, 522 (2d Cir. 1994) (citing <EM>Florida Power &amp; Light 
Co. v. Lorion</EM>, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985)) (The Second Circuit's remand included modification of the District Court's order, which erroneously limited the 
discretion of the Veteran's Administration on remand).  Remand is the remedy for an inadequate record, not reversal.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>The majority's decision to reverse this case instead of remanding the case with instructions, results from its own <EM>de novo </EM>review, which includes a 
determination that Applicant's testimony about changing his lifestyle is not credible.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  <EM>De novo </EM>review involves weighing conflicting evidence, that is, 
determining his 1999 and 2002 misconduct is more important than his remorse and employment record.  Ultimately, the majority is substituting its judgment on 
the ultimate disposition of the clearance for that of the Judge, who observed the Applicant's testimony, and evidently determined he was credible and not a 
security risk.  In regard to the majority's comments at note 6, I fully support efficient, timely, and practical decisions.  I do not urge remand in this case, and 
have not supported a second remand in any case(s).  But reversal here is contrary to the plain language of Directive &para; E3.1.33.3.  The Executive has clearly and 
explicitly placed the key responsibility for making the ultimate clearance decision outside the authority of the Board, except when an identified error <EM>mandates</EM> 
such action. </P> 
 
<P>A decision to reverse is effectively a determination that the evidence of record, despite contrary credibility determinations, and regardless of analysis, could 
never support approval of Applicant's clearance.  Stated differently, any decision on remand to approve a clearance, based on the evidence of record would be 
arbitrary, capricious or an abuse of discretion.  In view of the foregoing, the Board's conclusion that the Judge erred in his application of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines should not foreclose the Judge from deciding on remand that Applicant has mitigated security concerns under either Adjudicative Guidelines or the 
"whole person" concept.<A HREF="04-12648.a1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></P>

<P><A NAME="N_14_">14. </A>The majority opinion at 4 cites two ISCR decisions.  ISCR Case No 03-22563 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, 2006) involves an Applicant who had one special court-martial conviction, an other than honorable discharge from the service, a post-military service felony arrest, two misdemeanor arrests, and filed a false security 
clearance application and lied to an investigator concerning his clearance application.  ISCR Case No. 99-0122  (App. Bd. Apr. 7, 2000) involves an  Applicant 
with three security violations and six domestic incidents.  In both cases, the Appeal Board reversed the hearing Judge's decision citing peacemeal analysis.  
These two cases are quite dissimilar to Applicant's case. 
<P><A NAME="N_15_">15. </A>At the conclusion of Applicant's hearing, the Judge asked Department Counsel why the whole person concept should not work in Applicant's favor 
(Hearing Transcript at 52).  Department Counsel responded that Applicant had no criminal record up to the two offenses at issue, was a good employee, and a 
honorable reservist.  But he was a mature person with a family, who knew better.  He urged the Judge to "consider why he would risk all the good to do these 
two acts." (Hearing Transcript at 53).  Waiver is appropriate because Department Counsel's failed to address the nine factor analysis in Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 -

<P><A NAME="N_20_">20. </A>Directive &para; E3.1.33.3 states that the Appeal Board shall have authority to:  "Reverse the decision of the Administrative Judge if correction of the identified 
error mandates such action."  Clearly the Judge can take corrective action and there is no need to reverse the Judge's decision.  Reversal should be limited to 
situations where a Judge has failed to comply with a previous remand, where a statute or other regulatory requirement mandates a particular disposition, or 
where all reasonable judges would come to the same decision.  Remand allows the Judge to address the application of Mitigating Conditions, and 
administrative economy, fairness, and efficiency will be enhanced by the Judge's reconsideration of his whole person analysis. <EM>See generally Carnegie-Mellon 
Univ. v. Cohill</EM>, 484 U.S. 343, 349-350 (1988) (discussing the promotion of judicial efficiency, fairness, comity and economy resulting from remand to state 
court). 
<P><A NAME="N_21_">21. </A>Appellate courts occasionally  reverse an Administrative Judge's (AJ) decisions (or they may remand without reversing the AJ's decision), but then the 
appellate court directs issuance of a new decision consistent with the appellate court's opinion.  <EM>See</EM> ADMINISRATIVE LAW &sect; 6-51, Matthew Bender and Co. 
(2006).  I was unable to locate any federal appellate court decisions where an AJ presiding at a formal administrative hearing was reversed, and then the 
appellate court directed the result.  Reversal and remand, or remand without reversal are both consistent with the process outlined in Directive &para; E3.1.35, where 
remand by the Board automatically requires the Judge to issue a new clearance decision.  I conclude that the Board should follow the same process as appellate 
courts, unless specifically authorized to do otherwise.  A sample of cases from the Supreme Court and most of the circuits illustrates the strong preference for 
remand.  <EM>See, e.g.,  Camp v. Pitts</EM>, 411 U.S. 138 (1973); <EM>Sierra Club v. Army Corps of Eng'r</EM>, 772 F.2d 1043 (2d Cir. 1985); <EM>Alvarado Community Hosp. v.

<P><A NAME="N_22_">22. </A>The party challenging the Judge's "credibility determinations has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal."  ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 
2003).  And a Judge may use his credibility determination to make findings of fact in the face of conflicting record evidence. However, a Judge cannot rely on 
his credibility determination to the exclusion of documentary or other objective record evidence that is relevant and pertinent to the Judge's findings of fact.  
<EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0620 at 3 (October 19, 2001) (citing <EM>Anderson v. City of Bessemer</EM>, 470 U.S. 564, 575 (1985)). Department Counsel has not alleged that 
the Judge failed to consider any documentary or other objective evidence. 
<P><A NAME="N_23_">23. </A> I respectfully disagree with the majority's standard for reversal.  The majority is not supposed to review a case to see whether a clearance is "clearly 
consistent with national security."  That is the responsibility of the Judge who conducts the hearing.  Theoretically, the Judge could issue a non-piecemeal 
decision, and the Judge could again conclude that Applicant should receive a clearance under the whole person concept.  Even if the Board disagrees with this 
result, the issue is whether the decision is rational, the most deferential of standards.  The majority is engaging in <EM>de novo </EM>review, which requires that a 
particular result would in all cases be "arbitrary, capricious, or unlawful."  Under the circumstances, the Board should permit the Judge to address the errors, 
take corrective action, and come to his own conclusions.</P>
