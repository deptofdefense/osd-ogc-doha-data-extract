<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On December 10, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant
to Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated
February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
<EM>"Defense Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January
2, 1992, as amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary
determination that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 7, 1997 and requested a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on
January 27, 1997.  A hearing was convened on February 25, 1997 for the purpose of considering
whether it is clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue, deny, or revoke
Applicant's security clearance.  Applicant was unable to attend the scheduled hearing because of
illness.  During a subsequent telephone conference with Applicant and Department Counsel,
Applicant persuaded me that he wanted his case decided on the record--which was to include the
documents he would be submitting--and was willing to waive his right to the hearing which he
had previously requested.  The Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisted of 14
exhibits.<A HREF="96-0797.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  Applicant submitted 14 exhibits on his own behalf and objected to the admission of all
medical records included with the Government's exhibits. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>APPLICANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In the letter which he included with his exhibits, Applicant objects to Department
Counsel's submission of his (Applicant's) medical records, citing constitutional grounds and
violation of doctor-patient privilege.  Earlier Applicant had claimed that he signed
releases--granting the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) access to his medical records--under
duress (Item # 5 Gov. FORM).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's motion is denied.  He knowingly waived his constitutional right to withhold
his medical records from the Department of Defense (DoD)<STRONG> after</STRONG> being advised that withholding
his records may deny the DoD information they needed to make a determination on his security
clearance eligibility, and could result in the revocation of any existing security clearance.  (See
letter from Defense Legal Services Agency dated September 22, 1995, and Applicant's response:
items 4 and 5 of Applicant's Exhibits).</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted, without explanation, the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol
consumption (Criterion G) set forth under subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i., the factual allegations
pertaining to drug involvement (Criterion H) set forth under subparagraphs 2.a. through 2.i., the
factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (Criterion E) set forth under subparagraphs 3.a.
through 3.d., and the factual allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (Criterion J) set forth under
subparagraph 4.a.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is a 39 year old employee of a defense contractor.  He has worked for his
current employer since January 1994, and is seeking to retain the secret clearance which was
granted to him in 1988.<A HREF="96-0797.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  A favorable preliminary determination could not be made on
Applicant's current suitability for a security clearance because of alcohol consumption, drug
involvement, personal conduct, and falsification.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant first drank alcohol when he was 16 years old in 1974.  Shortly after being
introduced to alcohol, he began the pattern of consumption which would continue--almost
without interruption--until he stopped drinking on February 2, 1995.<A HREF="96-0797.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> He would drink 12 beers a
week--usually four-a-day over the weekends; and three or four times each year, Applicant would
drink to the point of intoxication (Item # 6 of Gov. FORM).  He last used alcohol on February 2,
1995.  At about the same time that he began using alcohol, Applicant was exposed to, and began
abusing, marijuana.  For the next twenty years including the time that he served in the U.S. Navy
(from 1978 to 1986), he would use marijuana with varying frequency--often as regular as daily. 
Applicant purchased marijuana from 1974 to January 1995.  While there was a period of time
when he was in the U.S. Navy,<A HREF="96-0797.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> and did not use marijuana because he was subject to urinalysis,
he was not subject to urinalysis between 1986 and September 1994.  Applicant last used
marijuana on January 31, 1995.  He tested positive for marijuana in a urinalysis administered on
February 3, 1995; he has tested negative in all subsequent tests.<A HREF="96-0797.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The abuse of alcohol and marijuana has had legal consequences for Applicant.  While
serving in the U.S. Navy, Applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the
UCMJ for using marijuana.  He was reduced in grade and fined $500.00.  In 1987, Applicant had
been drinking prior to becoming involved in an altercation which resulted in his being charged
with assault and battery.  The charges were placed on the stet docket for a year to allow
Applicant to pay restitution to the victim.  He was arrested for driving while intoxicated in June
1989; he was fined $250.00, sentenced to two days in the country jail and directed to seek
alcohol counseling.  In January 1991, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence; his
driver's licence was suspended; he was sentenced to 60 days in jail (with all but two weekends
suspended), awarded six months probation and ordered to pay costs of $80.00.  Applicant was
arrested most recently for driving while intoxicated on August 24, 1994, after he had been
involved in an accident which caused extensive damage to his new sport utility vehicle.  He
pleaded guilty to driving under the influence; his driver's license was restricted for three years; he
was fined $500.00 (which was suspended), sentenced to six months in the country jail,  directed
to seek treatment for his alcohol problem, and placed on two years supervised probation through
the Drinking Driving Monitor Program.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	On three occasions, Applicant has sought treatment for problems related to his use and
abuse of alcohol and marijuana.  He was hospitalized at Facility D from July 27 to August 2,
1993, where he was diagnosed with, and treated for: "Alcohol Abuse, Continuous" and "Mixed
Substance Abuse including Cannabis" (Item # 9 of Gov. FORM).  He remains under the care of
Dr. H, the treating physician.  (See Item # 7 of Applicant's Exhibits).  Applicant received
outpatient treatment from Facility F from September 28, 1994 to January 25, 1995; he was
treated for "Alcohol Abuse" and "THC Abuse" (Item # 10 of Gov. FORM).  From February 3 to
arch 2, 1995, Applicant received court-ordered inpatient treatment at Facility G for alcohol and
marijuana abuse.  The clinical supervisor provided a "guarded prognosis" when Applicant was
discharged--opining that he (Applicant) was "ambivalent" about his alcoholism, and was not
facing his marijuana use as a serious problem (Item # 11 of Gov. FORM).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The treatment records provided by Facility's D, F, and G contain more specific
information about the extent of Applicant's use of marijuana and alcohol.  According to the
records from Facility D, Applicant had been drinking four to eight beers a day, and had been
smoking "two to three joints of marijuana a day since 1979."  The treatment records from
Facility F do not include specific information about daily or weekly use of marijuana and
alcohol,<A HREF="96-0797.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> but disclose that Applicant had three  positive urinalysis (for marijuana) during the time
of treatment.  The records from Facility F also disclose that Applicant realized his alcohol and
marijuana use could jeopardize his security clearance and his employment.  The treatment
records from Facility G report that Applicant had been "using marijuana regularly for 22 years,"
and drinking from "one six-pack per week to one six-pack per night."  Applicant tested positive
for marijuana in a urinalysis administered at the time of his admission to Facility G.  The
information in these records provides a basis for finding that Applicant was abusing alcohol and
marijuana regularly prior to his admission to Facility G on February 3, 1995.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When Applicant completed a Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ) on September 4,
1987, he certified that:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">		....the entries made by me are true, complete and accurate to the
best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I
understand that a knowing and willful false statement on this form
can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In response to questions 15.a. and 15.b which asked if he had used, possessed or purchased any
narcotic (to include heroin or cocaine),....hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or cannabis (to
include marijuana or hashish), Applicant answered "yes" to both questions and admitted that he
used and purchased marijuana between 1976 and 1984.  He went on to explain that he had used it
from once a month to as often as three to five times a week before he  "quit on New Year's Eve
1984" (See Item # 3 of Gov. FORM).  In May 1990, Applicant was interviewed by the DIS as a
result of his June 1989 arrest for driving while intoxicated  (Item # 6 of Gov. FORM).  He was
questioned about his alcohol and marijuana abuse, and swore--in a statement provided incident
to that interview--that he had not used marijuana since 1984, and that he did not intend to use it
in the future.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">          	Applicant completed a National Agency Questionnaire (NAQ) on June 14, 1993 (Item # 2
Gov. FORM) which included a certification identical to that contained on the PSQ which he had
completed in 1987.  He  answered "yes" to question 20.a. which asked if he had used marijuana. 
He answered "no" to the question which asked if he had ever purchased marijuana.  Applicant
admitted using marijuana "5 or 6 times" on an experimental basis, and again stated that he did
not intend to use it in the future.  On an NAQ which Applicant completed on May 2, 1994, he
again answered "yes" to question 20.a. (admitting use) and "no" to question 20.b .(denying
purchasing).  And he admitted again that he had used marijuana "5 or 6 times" on an
experimental basis, and that he did not intend to use it in the future<A HREF="96-0797.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> (Item # 1 of Gov. FORM). 
Applicant finally admitted that he had used and purchased marijuana up to January 31, 1995
during interviews with the DIS in May and June of 1996 (Item # 14 Gov. FORM).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In 1993 while being treated at Facility D for substance abuse, Applicant was diagnosed
by Dr. H as having bi-polar disorder or manic depressive illness.  Dr. H prescribed lithium and
antabuse and "clearly instructed" Applicant to avoid all alcohol, to include mouthwash and cough
syrup.  In his August 1995 statement to the DIS, Applicant stated that alcohol abuse is "a
symptom of (his) illness" (bi-polar disorder) and that he had "unknowingly" been using alcohol
to self-medicate his illness (Item # 4 Gov. FORM).  There is no information in any of the
medical records which would confirm Applicant's statement that alcohol abuse is a "symptom" of
bi-polar disorder.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has submitted numerous letters of reference which attest to his vocational
talents  and work ethic.  His supervisor for the past nine months thinks highly of Applicant and
does not consider him to be a security risk.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye

Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted facts alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria G, H, E, and J.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion G.  Applicant has been
abusing alcohol for at least ten years.  Evidence of his abuse can be found in his four alcohol-related
arrests, in Applicant's admissions, and in the treatment records from Facility's D, F, and G.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In mitigation, Applicant presents 24 months of continuous abstinence from alcohol.  In
addition to abstaining from alcohol, he has been attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) regularly,
first as a condition of probation, but more recently, as part of his own recovery program. Applicant
was recently discharged early from the Drinking Driver Monitor Program because of his compliance
with all of the conditions of his probation.  Although he did not receive a favorable prognosis from
the credentialed medical professional who prepared the treatment summary when he was discharged
from Facility G in March 1995, his abstinence and adherence to an aftercare program in the two
years since discharge persuades this Administrative Judge that a revision of the "guarded" prognosis
is now  warranted.  It is significant that the most recent progress notes from Dr. H indicate that
Appellant has been making excellent progress in stabilizing his moods--progress which would be
unlikely if he were continuing to consume alcohol (See Item # 9 Gov. FORM).  Criterion G is
concluded for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has established its case with respect to Criterion H.  Applicant's admissions
to the SOR allegations under Paragraph 2 (pertaining to his marijuana abuse), and the information
about marijuana abuse in his treatment records from Facility's D, F, and G establish that Applicant
abused marijuana regularly until January 31, 1995.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is credited with having received treatment for marijuana abuse on three occasions. 
The records indicate that he was receptive to treatment and actively participated in the individual and 
group counseling sessions.  Additional mitigation is found in Applicant's 24 months of continuous
abstinence from marijuana--corroborated by urinalysis that have been consistently negative. 
Allegations 2.d. through 2.f. of the SOR are concluded for Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	While Applicant's claim that he has not used marijuana since his most recent inpatient
treatment is unrefuted, his history of marijuana abuse and his failure to remain steadfast to earlier
stated intentions--not to use marijuana in the future--provide the background against which to
measure his recent behavior and assurances of continued abstention.  Four times previously,
Applicant has lied about past use of marijuana, and four times previously, Applicant has stated that
he did not intend to use marijuana in the future.  All the while he was lying about his past marijuana
use and stating that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, Applicant was continuing to use
marijuana.  He continued to use marijuana even knowing that he was jeopardizing his security
clearance and possibly his employment.  Because Applicant's behavior evidences a near compulsion
to use marijuana, a longer period of abstinence is needed to persuade this Administrative Judge that
his need for this substance has finally dissipated.  Accordingly, allegations 2.a. through 2.c. and 2.e.
through 2.i. are concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Criterion E applies to "the deliberate omission...of relevant and material facts from any
personnel security questionnaire...deliberately providing false and misleading information...to an
investigator in connection with a personnel security...determination."  Facts are considered relevant
and material when they are capable of influencing a federal agency's decision, e.g., a decision to
grant or deny a security clearance.  In this instance, Applicant's continuing, regular abuse and
purchase of marijuana from the mid-1970's to January 31, 1995 falls well within the definition of
materiality.  Applicant had deliberately omitted the relevant and material facts about his regular
marijuana abuse and purchases from the security questionnaires which he completed on September
4, 1987, June 14, 1993, and May 2, 1994.  And Applicant had provided false and misleading
information to the DIS in May 1990 when he swore that he had stopped using marijuana in 1984. 
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Because Applicant had provided misinformation to the DoD on four different occasions over
a period of seven years beginning in 1987, his misconduct was neither an isolated event, nor an event
far removed from the present.  He did not tell the whole truth about his marijuana abuse until he was
interviewed by the DIS in May and June of 1996.  Under the circumstances, Applicant cannot be
credited with making a prompt good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being confronted
with the facts.  All allegations in the SOR under Criterion E are concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The government has established its case under Criterion J.  Applicant willfully withheld 
information from the DoD on a matter that was clearly relevant and material to his security clearance
eligibility in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.  The information withheld by Applicant had the potential
to influence the course of his background investigation in areas of legitimate concern to the DoD.

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A><FONT SIZE="-1"> Because the Government exhibits are not marked or otherwise identified, they will be identified numerically according
to the order in which they appear in Department Counsel's submission.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A><FONT SIZE="-1"> Applicant states that he has had a  security clearance for 15 years (Item # 4 Gov. FORM), however the only reference
in the record to when Applicant was granted a security clearance is found in Item 3 of the Government FORM--his
1993 NAQ.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A> <FONT SIZE="-1">There were periods of time when Applicant drank more (See Item #11 Gov. FORM) and there were times when he
stopped drinking completely--for nine months in 1987, for 2 &frac12; months prior to his 1994 treatment at Facility A, and
at other times not specified (Items 10 and 11 Gov. FORM) </FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A> <FONT SIZE="-1">These tests  began around the time Applicant received an Article 15 for using marijuana in 1984.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A> <FONT SIZE="-1">Applicant does not indicate the number of times he has been tested since February 1995.</FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A><FONT SIZE="-1"> Applicant reported drinking alcohol "2-3 times" per week (quantity not specified), and using marijuana "when
available."</FONT>
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A><FONT SIZE="-1"> The SOR does not allege that Applicant falsified the NAQ which he completed on May 2, 1994; this NAQ is
mentioned because it is one of the items in the FORM submitted by Department Counsel, and because it contains the
same misinformation about Applicant's marijuana abuse as did the PSQ he completed in 1987 and the NAQ he
completed in 1993.  Applicant did not object to the admission of 1994 NAQ.</FONT>
