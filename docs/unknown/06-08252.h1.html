<P>On September 12, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR), changing the reference from Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, <EM>Personnel 
Security Program</EM> (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended to DoD Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended and modified.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant did not object to the amendment.  Department Counsel's motion is granted.   </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On December 7, 2004, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Standard Form (SF) 85P).<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  On July 11, 2006, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to her,<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> pursuant to the Directive and the Regulation.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR 
detailed reasons why DOHA recommends that Applicant's case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination that Applicant is not eligible for occupying an ADP I/II/III position.</P> 
 
<P>In a notarized answer, dated July 27, 2006, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> A complete copy of the file 
of relevant material (FORM), dated September 13, 2006 was provided to her on September 19, 2006; and she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  On September 27 and October 10, 2006, DOHA received additional materials in response to the FORM from Applicant.  On October 19, 2006, Department Counsel 
indicated she did not object to the additional matters Applicant submitted.  The case was assigned to me on October 19, 2006.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guideline F, Applicant admitted that she was  responsible for the debts listed on the SOR.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  Her 
response to the SOR indicated the SOR debts became delinquent between December 1999 and July 2001.  The debts in SOR <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">&para;&para; 1.a and 1.c are duplications</SPAN>.  After a complete and thorough review 
of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 43-years-old, and has been employed by a United States government contractor since January 2005.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  From 2002 to 2004, she attended a business technology college and received an 
associates degree.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  She has no prior military service.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  From 2000 to 2004, she was employed with a temporary employment agency, a bank and worked briefly in production/assembly.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  She 
became unemployed in November 1999, and in June 2002 both times due to corporate downsizing.  She was unemployed for about six months each time.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The quality of her employment is not 
characterized.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The date of her marriage is not in the record, but she was divorced from her husband in October or November 1999.  Her husband stopped making child support payments three or 
four months after the divorce.  As a result of her divorce, and unemployment, she fell behind in making payments on her debts.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On April 21, 2005, Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) to the security investigator.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  In 2005, her gross salary was $2,054.00 per month, her net salary was $1,494.00 per 
month, and her expenses totaled $1,065.00 per month. After making all payments, including rent ($445.00), groceries ($200.00), clothing ($60.00), utilities ($120.00), car expenses ($140.00), 
(payments on student loan of $21,558 were deferred) and miscellaneous ($100.00), $429.00 per month remained.  The 2005 PFS did not include any of the debts that were listed on the SOR.  The 
PFS lists assets of $400.00 in savings, and a car valued at $3,600.00.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM> </EM> </SPAN></P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG>  In the evaluation of an Applicant's security suitability for a public trust position, an administrative judge must consider Appendix 8 of the Regulation, which sets forth brief</CENTER> 
 
introductory explanations for each guideline, and the adjudicative guidelines, which are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC). </P> 
 
<P>These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision at Appendix 8 of the Regulation. An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.</P> 
 
<P>To be eligible for a public trust position, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Regulation.  "The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, 
based on all available information, the person's loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security."  Regulation &para; C6.1.1.1. </P> 
 
<P>"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk."  Regulation, Appendix 8.  
Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.  Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed in 
the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 132: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency 
and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Financial Considerations - Guideline F: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed 
in the Conclusions section below.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A> The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates, in 
accordance with Regulation, Appendix 8, that it is not clearly consistent with national security to approve eligibility for a public trust position. Directive &para; E3.1.14.  If the government meets its 
initial burden, the Applicant then has the burden of persuasion, that is to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the 
government's case.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the 
national security."  Directive &para; E2.2.2.  These same burdens of proof apply to trustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants eligibility for a public trust position.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard  
sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.</P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Decisions concerning eligibility for a public trust 
position cover many characteristics of an Applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN>Applicant's failure to pay her debts is of concern, especially in light of her desire to have access to sensitive government information.  
Regulation, Appendix 8, clearly expresses the government's concern regarding financial considerations, stating, "an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in 
illegal acts to generate funds." <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A person who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect sensitive 
information.</SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's actions in failing to satisfy her outstanding financial obligations give rise to Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 1, "a history of not meeting financial 
obligations," and FC DC 3, "inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts."  The debt in SOR &para; 1.a is included in the debt in SOR &para; 1.c.  The four debts listed in SOR &para;&para; 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e will be 
discussed briefly below.  </P> 
 
<P>FC DCs 1 and 3 apply to her multiple failures to meet her financial obligations, and her admission that she was unable to pay her debts, which then became delinquent and remained delinquent from 
2002 until her debt consolidation loan brings them to current status. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to 
produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>I considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 1, "the behavior was not recent;" FC MC 2, "it was an isolated incident;" FC MC 3, "conditions that resulted in the behavior 
were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation;" FC MC 4, "the person has received or is 
receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;" and FC MC 6, "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts."   </P> 
 
<P>The Regulation does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  In the last four years Applicant had four delinquent debts.  Based on 
evaluation of the record evidence as a whole,<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> I conclude FC MCs 1and 2 do not apply because Applicant has multiple (four) delinquent SOR debts.  Even if the payments are now  considered 
current due to her debt consolidation loan, this loan was obtained in July 2006, after she received the SOR.  This positive change is simply too recent to merit full application of FC MC 1. </P> 
 
<P>FC MC 3 partially applies to all four SOR debts at issue because the debts became delinquent in 1999 and 2002 were the result of her 1999 divorce and her unemployment (in 1999 and 2002).  
Applicant's divorce and unemployment are specifically enumerated in FC MC 3 as examples of causes of financial problems that may be "largely beyond the person's control."  I conclude that 
Applicant's statement about how her divorce and unemployment affected her financial situation is credible and sufficient to provide some credit under FC MC 3 in regard to her debts.  Applicant, 
however, does not receive full credit for FC MC 3 because she had approximately four years to demonstrate progress resolving these four debts.  The impact of her 2002 unemployment is somewhat 
reduced by her steady employment for the past 18 months, and the paucity of evidence showing how she has endeavored to pay or resolve her debts.  She has made progress resolving her debts for 
the last three months, and some credit is warranted for her payments on her debt consolidation loan.  </P> 
 
<P>A credit counseling service stopped creditors from harassing Applicant in 1999, reached some settlements with her creditors and established a payment plan.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  She became unemployed in 2002, 
and her debts again became delinquent.  FC MC 4 does not fully apply because there is insufficient evidence that she has had recent financial counseling. Some mitigating credit is warranted 
because there are clear indications (since July 2006) that the problem is being resolved or is under control. </P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of her debts.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN>  She has not provided any information about 
how she attempted to resolve or repay her debts in the period from 2002 until July 2006.  She does, however, merit partial credit for her recent efforts through a debt consolidation program to repay 
her creditors, which is a legal means for resolving these four debts.<A HREF="06-08252.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  Reduction in her debts will substantially reduce her potential vulnerability to improper financial inducements.        <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>

</A> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under the Regulation, Appendix 8, at 
132<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">. As noted above, Applicant's lengthy history of failing to meet her financial obligations, and inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts raise serious trustworthiness concerns. She is 43 years 
old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for her conduct.  Her actions in generating or failing to resolve her four debts were knowledgeable and voluntary. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> <SUP></SUP>Her debt problems resulted from 
voluntary decisions to purchase items.  However her initial inability to repay her debts resulted from her divorce, her husband's failure to pay child support, and two periods of unemployment.  She 
subsequently made decisions to use her money for her education, and her children, rather than paying her four creditors.  There is some evidence of rehabilitation and positive behavior changes as 
indicated by her statement that she intends to work overtime to increase her income, her arrangement in July 2006 for a debt consolidation loan, and her credible promise to pay her creditors.  So 
there is some possibility of increased income and a short track record of three payments on her debt consolidation loan.  </SPAN>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress is low-Applicant 
has not obtained any additional debt, except for her student loan, in the last several years. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> These behavior changes will result in an improvement of her financial circumstances.  Applicant earned an 
associate's degree in 2004.  She does not have any credit cards, and her only new debt is her $21,000.00 student loan.  She has made all of her scheduled payments on her student loan. These recent 
accomplishments show significant self-discipline.  In sum, the likelihood of recurrent debt problems is low. </SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and
