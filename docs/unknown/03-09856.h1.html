<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On October 21, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program </EM>(Directive), dated 
January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline D, Sexual Behavior, and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption, of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. </P> 
<P>On December 3, 2004, Applicant, through counsel, submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He requested a hearing. </P> 
<P>This matter was assigned to another administrative judge on September 6, 2005, but reassigned to me on September 13, 2005 because of caseload 
considerations. A notice of hearing was issued on September 26, 2005, and a hearing was held on October 12, 2005. Joint Exhibit 1 was admitted into evidence. 
Government Exhibits 1 through 6 and Applicant Exhibit A were admitted into evidence.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on 
October 24, 2005.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant admitted the allegation in subparagraph 1.b of the SOR.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> This admission is incorporated here as a finding of fact. He admitted in part and denied in 
part the allegations in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He denied the remaining allegations.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon 
due consideration, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 45-year-old manager and engineer for a defense contractor.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant has worked for this contractor for nine and one-half years.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> His 
performance evaluations have always been "exceptional," "outstanding," or "exceeds expectations".<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> He has received commendations and cash bonuses for his 
work-related problem solving skills.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF 86) in February 2001.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant has a Bachelor of Science degree, a Masters of Science degree, and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> His first wife died in 1992.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> He married his 
second wife in December 1993 and in a second ceremony in June 1994.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> He adopted her son and daughter in 1994.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Beginning in 1998, his relationship with his wife started to deteriorate. During this time, they lived with each other on and off.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> In early August 2000 in the 
morning before work, Applicant's adopted daughter, who was 14 years old, was not feeling well, came into his bedroom, and asked to be held.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> She laid down 
on his bed as did he.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> He wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> He did not pay attention to how he positioned his arms in this hug, which resulted in 
his arms inadvertently resting against her breasts, causing what he describes as an unexpected "emotional" reaction.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Within the next week, two other incidents occurred. He observed his adopted daughter taking a bath without her knowledge.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> There is no evidence he was 
drinking at this time. On the evening of August 8, 2000, he consumed too much wine, which impaired his judgment.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> After giving his adopted daughter a 
goodnight hug and kiss, he laid down on her bed and began to touch and fondle her breasts.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> He stopped soon after when he realized that she was almost asleep 
and that he was doing something terribly wrong.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Within a week of these egregious incidents, Applicant admitted his conduct to his wife.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A> He called a local child abuse hotline and reported what he had done, 
without regard to the possible criminal charges.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> Based on the hotline's advice, he called the police and child protective services.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A> He reported his 
inappropriate conduct to both.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A> The police came to his home the same day and talked with him.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A> He told the police that he intended to move out of the family 
home that evening.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A> The police remained while he packed his belongings, and until he left.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A> He never returned to live in the family home.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A> The police did not 
arrest or charge him with any crime related to the second incident.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A> No other agency investigated the incidents or recommended action against him. 
Subsequently, he and his second wife divorced.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A> He has not remarried.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>At the same time he reported his unacceptable conduct, he sought counseling to understand his behavior as he had never previously engaged in such conduct.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> 
His started counseling with a licensed psychologist in August 2000 to explore the circumstances, and interpersonal and intrapsychic dynamics surrounding the 
incident with his adopted daughter.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> One month later, he stopped treatment with her and began treatment with a psychiatrist and licensed counselor specializing 
in sexual deviance, parenting skills, and anger management.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A> With the concurrence of the psychiatrist and licensed counselor, he ceased these counseling 
sessions in March 2001 after achieving his treatment goals in parenting and anger management, and because after several months in the program, he did not 
believe that he met the criteria for sexual deviance.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> He then resumed counseling with the licensed psychologist (treating psychologist) and continues to see her 
on a regular basis.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The professionals who have treated Applicant state that he never denied his conduct towards his adopted daughter, and always took full responsibility for it.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> 
They further opined that he openly explored multiple personal issues to gain an understanding of his conduct, and actively participated in his treatment.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> None 
of these professionals diagnosed him as a sexual offender or deviant, nor did they relate his unacceptable sexual conduct to alcohol abuse.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> His treating 
psychologist stated that he is not a pedophile, and that he does not fit into the sex offender class.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> She also opined that she sees no probability of a reoccurrence 
of his behavior.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> Her diagnosis is adjustment disorder following crisis, including anxiety and depression.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant denies any sexual attraction to children.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A> Outside of the August 2000 incidents with his adopted daughter, he has never inappropriately touched 
another child.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A> He is not, and has never been, interested in child pornography nor is he sexually attracted to children.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_47_"><SUP> (47)</SUP></A> He has apologized to his adopted 
daughter for his actions.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_48_"><SUP> (48)</SUP></A> He provided her with counseling shortly after the incident, and has agreed to provide her with counseling in the future, should she 
want it.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_49_"><SUP> (49)</SUP></A> He has continued with his counseling to understand all the issues related to his relationship with his ex-wife and his daughter.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_50_"><SUP> (50)</SUP></A> In 2002, his adopted 
children moved to another area with their mother, the custodial parent, because she had a job opportunity. Until this time, his visits with his adopted daughter 
and her brother were unsupervised.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_51_"><SUP> (51)</SUP></A> He continues to maintain a relationship with both children.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_52_"><SUP> (52)</SUP></A> Applicant has told two women (one is a psychiatric nurse) 
with whom he has developed lengthy close personal relationships about his conduct towards his adopted daughter.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_53_"><SUP> (53)</SUP></A> His extended family also knows. Finally, he 
reported the incident to his employer in November 2000.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_54_"><SUP> (54)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Applicant tried rum at the age of eighteen, but did not start drinking until the age of twenty-one.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_55_"><SUP> (55)</SUP></A> Initially, he drank two or three beers at bars while listening to 
music.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_56_"><SUP> (56)</SUP></A> When he moved to his own residence, he drank more frequently, up to a twelve-pack of beer a week.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_57_"><SUP> (57)</SUP></A> During the last two years of his first marriage, 
he drank over a case of beer a week.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_58_"><SUP> (58)</SUP></A> After his first wife died, his consumption of beer declined to about a case a week.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_59_"><SUP> (59)</SUP></A> It increased when his second marriage 
began to fail.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_60_"><SUP> (60)</SUP></A> Because his second wife preferred wine, he switched to drinking a bottle of wine each evening until the incident with his adopted daughter.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_61_"><SUP> (61)</SUP></A> He 
immediately stopped drinking without difficulty or experiencing symptoms of withdrawal.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_62_"><SUP> (62)</SUP></A> He has since resumed drinking, and currently may drink up to a 
bottle of wine in the evening.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_63_"><SUP> (63)</SUP></A> </P> 
<P>Applicant has never been diagnosed as alcohol dependent by a professional.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_64_"><SUP> (64)</SUP></A> His counselors deny that he has been treated for alcohol abuse or substance abuse, 
although the summary of the investigator's interview with his treating psychologist indicated a diagnosis of alcohol abuse in remission.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_65_"><SUP> (65)</SUP></A> His treating 
psychologist told the investigator that alcohol was no longer an issue and that he was not an alcoholic.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_66_"><SUP> (66)</SUP></A> In her subsequent medical report, she declined to 
diagnose alcohol dependence or abuse.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_67_"><SUP> (67)</SUP></A> She also stated his current drinking is for pleasure and of a different character in the terms of the type, amount, and 
most importantly, his emotional state.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_68_"><SUP> (68)</SUP></A> Medical testing in December 2003 did not reveal any physiologic changes, such as liver function abnormalities or 
elevations in MCV (mean corpuscular volume) or MCH (mean corpuscular hemoglobin),<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_69_"><SUP> (69)</SUP></A> indicative of excessive alcohol consumption.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_70_"><SUP> (70)</SUP></A> Both women with 
whom he has had a close personal relationship acknowledge he drinks, but deny seeing him intoxicated or drinking to excess.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_71_"><SUP> (71)</SUP></A> Rather, he drinks moderately,

</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. </P> 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_74_"><SUP> (74)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_75_"><SUP> (75)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_76_"><SUP> (76)</SUP></A> 
Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case 
against</P> 
<P>him.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_77_"><SUP> (77)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_78_"><SUP> (78)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_79_"><SUP> (79)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_80_"><SUP> (80)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_81_"><SUP> (81)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_82_"><SUP> (82)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Sexual Behavior - Guideline D: Sexual behavior is a security concern if it involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, 
may subject the individual to coercion, exploitation, or duress or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption - Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to 
control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline D as to allegations 1.a through 1.d. Based on all the evidence, Sexual Behavior Disqualifying 
Condition (SB DC) E2.A4.1.2.1. (<EM>Sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted</EM>), and SB DC E2.A4.1.2.3. (<EM>Sexual 
behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress</EM>) apply. Applicant intentionally and inappropriately touched his 14-year-old adopted daughter on one occasion. On another occasion, he observed her taking a bath without her knowledge. Although he was never charged with a crime, 
his conduct is a sexual behavior of a criminal nature. Given the seriousness of his actions, he could be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.</P> 
<P>I considered the Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions (SB MC). I conclude that SB MC E2.A4.1.3.2. (<EM>The behavior is not recent and there is no evidence of 
subsequent conduct of a similar nature</EM>) applies. In a week's time, five years ago, Applicant observed his adopted daughter taking a bath, intentionally fondled 
her, and inadvertently touched her breasts while hugging her. Prior to this time, he had never touched his daughter or any other child inappropriately. The record 
lacks any evidence that he has acted inappropriately towards her or any other child since. His treating psychologist specifically states he does not meet the 
profile of a pedofile or sexual deviant. No medical expert has diagnosed him as a sexual deviant or predator nor has he been treated for this behavior.</P> 
<P>SB MC E2.A4.1.3.3. (<EM>There is no other evidence of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotional instability</EM>) applies. Applicant has always taken 
responsibility for his conduct. On his own initiative, he notified the appropriate authorities of his conduct and removed himself from his home. He immediately 
sought counseling for himself and his adopted daughter to understand his behavior. Neither his counselors nor his psychiatrist have diagnosed him with any 
mental illness or indicated that he is emotionally unstable. In fact, their reports reaffirm that while his conduct towards his adopted daughter showed very 
questionable judgment in a limited time frame, his subsequent actions reflect his sense of responsibly for his unacceptable conduct. He manages his finances 
well. His work and personal life are stable. On the night of August 8, 2000, he drank too much wine, which impaired his judgment this day, and lead to his 
inappropriate touching of his daughter. At this time, he drank because of the stress in his marriage and related stress at home. His home environment has 
changed completely and is no longer a source of stress, requiring a need for alcohol. He initially stopped drinking immediately after the incident with his 
daughter, but has resumed drinking wine for pleasure. Both women with whom he developed a close relationship after his divorce, deny observing him 
intoxicated and drinking to excess. He has changed his drinking and is cognizant of drinking's impact on his behavior.</P> 
<P>SB MC E2.A4.1.3.4. (<EM>The behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress)</EM> also applies. He reported his inappropriate actions to the 
child abuse hotline, the police, and his employer. He is open about his conduct with his family. He told two women about his conduct at the risk of ending his 
relationship with them. While he does not advertise his conduct, he certainly told those individuals who should know about it. Since the incidents five years 
ago, there has been no repeat of Applicant's conduct. The mental health professionals treating him have declined to diagnose him as a sexual deviant or 
pedophile. His treating psychologist has stated that she sees no probability of a recurrence of this behavior. He would not be subject to coercion, exploitation or 
duress because of his inappropriate conduct with his adopted daughter. Applicant has mitigated the government's case under Guideline D. Accordingly, for the 
reasons stated above, allegations 1.a. through 1.d. of the SOR are concluded in favor of Applicant. </P> 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline G as to allegations 2.a and 2.c. Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1. 
(<EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol use</EM>) and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5. (<EM>Habitual ... consumption to the point of impaired judgment</EM>) apply. Applicant drank beer or wine nightly for many years 
although not necessarily to impairment. As a consequent of his habitual drinking, one evening in August 2000 after too much wine which impaired his 
judgment, he inappropriately touched his adopted daughter. He consumed excessive amounts of beer, and occasionally wine, in the past, causing him to act 
inappropriately towards his adopted daughter once.</P> 
<P>The government asserts that AC DC E2.A7.1.2.3. (<EM>Diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence</EM>) and AC DC 
E2.A7.1.2.6. (<EM>Consumption of alcohol subsequent to a diagnosis of alcoholism by a credentialed medial professional and following completion of an alcohol 
rehabilitation program</EM>) apply. The government cites the notation in the investigative report which states that his treating psychologist diagnosed alcohol 
abuse.<A HREF="03-09856.h1.html#N_83_"><SUP> (83)</SUP></A> Applicant's treating psychologist submitted a report summarizing her treatment of Applicant and her diagnostic findings. She clearly opines that 
Applicant has not been diagnosed as alcohol dependent nor has he been treated for it. She also declined to diagnose alcohol abuse, stating there is no indication 
of an impairment in his life which can be attributed to alcohol. The investigator's notes reflect that she told him/her that alcohol was not an issue, and that 
Applicant was not an alcoholic. The investigator's notes do not indicate that he underwent treatment for alcohol abuse. The licensed counselor definitively 
stated that he was not diagnosed as a substance abuser and that he was not treated for substance dependence or abuse. The evidence as a whole does not 
establish that Applicant has ever been diagnosed as alcohol dependent or treated for alcohol abuse or dependency. Thus, the government has not established its 
case as to allegation 2.b of the SOR.</P> 
<P>I have considered all the Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) and conclude that AC MC E2.A7.1.3.1. (<EM>The alcohol-related incidents do not 
indicate a pattern</EM>) applies. At the hearing, the government conceded that since only one alcohol-related incident with his adopted daughter happened, it would 
be hard to establish a pattern of conduct. In light of this concession, I conclude that the government did not establish that a pattern of inappropriate conduct 
existed between Applicant and his adopted daughter. Thus, he has mitigated the government's concerns.</P> 
<P>AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2. (<EM>The problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>), and AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3. (<EM>Positive 
changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>) also apply in this case. It has been more than five years since the incidents with his daughter. Only one of the three 
incidents involved the use of alcohol. There have been no further incidents with her or any other children for any reason or as a result of drinking. When the 
incident occurred in August 2000, Applicant immediately stopped drinking without any signs of alcohol withdrawal. Although he has resumed drinking in 
varying quantities every evening, he drinks for pleasure, and not to cover or hide his feelings as in the past. He developed a lengthy close personal relationships 
with two women who have frequently observed his more recent alcohol consumption and who have definitively stated that his moderate consumption of alcohol 
has not led to intoxication or a change in his personality or conduct. He has not been arrested for any alcohol-related matters. He continues to perform at a high 
level at work and manages his finances well. With his divorce, he has removed himself from a situation which lead to drinking to cover his feelings, a fact 
supported by the diagnosis of his treating psychologist. He has mitigated the government's concerns under Guideline G.</P> 
<P>The note under Guideline D instructs adjudicators to consider Guideline I, Emotional, Mental and Personality Disorders, and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, 
when determining how to resolve the security concerns under this Guideline. The adjudicators decided not to allege a security concern under either guideline. 
The administrative judge has the authority to amend the SOR. Because of the note, I have considered the option to amend the SOR, and have decided against 
amending the SOR to include Guideline I and Guideline J. The issue of criminal conduct is addressed specifically in Guideline D and has been fully considered. 
The medical reports of record fail to indicated the presence of an emotional, mental or personality disorder requiring treatment. The contingent emotional and 
mental issues associated with Applicant's sexual behavior have been reviewed under guideline D.</P> 
<P>Finally, I have considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I am persuaded by the 
totality of the evidence in this case that Applicant's inappropriate sexual behavior occurred within a very narrow time frame and during a time of emotional 
distress. He realized that he was wrong. He not only notified the proper authorities without regard to the consequences, he also sought professional treatment to 
understand his conduct. He did everything he should have done at the time of the incident to address his conduct and to reduce the probability of a future 
occurrence. He has successfully avoided any further problems. He has always taken full responsibility for his actions. He has been forthright about what he did 
with his employer and others with whom he has developed a close relationship. He continues with regular counseling sessions and should continue to do so. 
Objective medical testing by his medical doctor does not show any physical problems connected with his consumption of wine. His female companions have 
not observed alcohol related behavior which would cause them concern. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.</P>
