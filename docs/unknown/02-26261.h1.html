<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">HISTORY OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>On March 18, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2,</P> 
<P>1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons</P> 
<P>why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it</P> 
<P>is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative 
Judge to conduct proceedings and</P> 
<P>determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>On April 16, 2004, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected</P> 
<P>to have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. The matter was assigned</P> 
<P>to me for resolution on July 2, 2004. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 3, 2004, setting the</P> 
<P>hearing for August 24, 2004. At the hearing, the Government introduced ten exhibits (GX 1 - 10).</P> 
<P>Applicant testified and introduced three exhibits (AX A - C). The transcript was received at DOHA</P> 
<P>on September 13, 2004.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>       </P> 
<P>Applicant is a 54-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. The April 14, 2004 SOR  contains six allegations under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), and 
three allegations under Guideline 13 (Foreign Influence). in his May 1, 2004 Response to the SOR, Applicant admits all of</P> 
<P>the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. The admitted parts of the allegations are accepted and</P> 
<P>incorporated herein as Findings of Fact.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>After considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS</P> 
<P>OF FACT as to the status, past and present, of each SOR allegation:</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>l.a. - Applicant exercised dual citizenship - Republic of China (Taiwan) by birth and United</P> 
<P>States (U.S.) by naturalization.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>1 .b. - Applicant applied for and was issued a Taiwan passport on July 16, 2001, even though</P> 
<P>he had become a U.S. citizen in December 1986, and he had a valid U.S. passport issued to him in</P> 
<P>July 1989 and renewed in March 2000. However, as discussed below, he never used the passport.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>1 .c. - As of October 9, 2003, when he was interviewed by an Agent of the Defense Security</P> 
<P>Service (DSS), Applicant still retained the Taiwan passport he obtained in July2001, for the purpose</P> 
<P>of being able to "get rid of the small estate inherited from [his] grandfather" in Taiwan (Response</P> 
<P>to SOR). The passport was valid until July2011. However, after the events of September 11, 2001,</P> 
<P>he cancelled the trip to Taiwan and never used the passport for that or any other reason. On April</P> 
<P>16. 2004, after receiving the SOR, Applicant surrendered the passport to Taiwan authorities (Attachment to SOR).</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2.a. - Applicant's brother is a permanent resident of the U.S., and a citizen of Taiwan, and</P> 
<P>currently resides in Taiwan with his American wife and two grown children. He is a teacher at a private high school and has no connection with the Taiwan 
government.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2.b. - Applicant is the co-owner of inherited real property in Taiwan. He has a 1/32 share of</P> 
<P>a one story building of about 1,400 square feet. The estimated value of the property is about $104,000, so his 1/32 share is worth about $3,273. His small share 
gives him no real control over</P> 
<P>the property and a minimal return, so he is seeking a buyer. His assets in the U.S. exceed  $3,000,000.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2.c. - Applicant's uncle, a naturalized U.S. citizen, now resides in Taiwan and manages the</P> 
<P>property, including representing Applicant's interest in his 1/32 share.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of nine generic factors relevant</P> 
<P>in all cases: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding</P> 
<P>the conduct, to include knowing participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the</P> 
<P>individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)</P> 
<P>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation</P> 
<P>for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood</P> 
<P>of continuation or recurrence (Directive, E.2.2.1., on page 16 of Enclosure 2). I have considered all</P> 
<P>nine factors, individually and collectively, in reaching my overall conclusion.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Because each security case presents its own facts and circumstances, it should not he assumed</P> 
<P>that the factors cited above exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally</P> 
<P>in every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may 
be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable financial judgment and conduct.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>The eligibility criteria established by Executive Order 10865 and DoD Directive 5220.6 identify personal characteristics and conduct that are reasonably related 
to the ultimate question of</P> 
<P>whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" for an individual to hold a security clearance. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination based on the "whole person" concept required by the Directive, the Administrative Judge is not permitted to speculate, but can only draw those 
inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must 
make</P> 
<P>critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>In the defense industry, the security of classified information is entrusted to civilian workers</P> 
<P>who must he counted on to safeguard classified information and material twenty-four hours a (lay.</P> 
<P>The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an</P> 
<P>applicant for a security clearance, in his or her private life or connected to work, may he involved</P> 
<P>in conduct that demonstrates poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or unreliability. These concerns  include consideration of the potential, as well as the actual, 
risk that an applicant may deliberately</P> 
<P>or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>An applicant's admission of the information in specific allegations relieves the Government</P> 
<P>of having to prove those allegations. If specific allegations and/or information are denied or  otherwise controverted by the applicant, the Government has the 
initial burden of proving those  controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden (either</P> 
<P>by the Applicant's admissions or by other evidence) and proves conduct that creates security  concerns under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts 
to the Applicant to present  evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence</P> 
<P>of conduct that falls within specific criteria in the Directive, it is nevertheless consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>A person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the</P> 
<P>Government based upon trust and confidence. As required by DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended.</P> 
<P>at E2.2.2., "any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with the</P> 
<P>interests of national security will be resolved in favor of the nation's security."</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Applicant is 54 years old (born in Taiwan in 1961). He came to the United States in 1974  to further his education, culminating in a Ph.D. He is an Engineer for 
a major defense contractor and</P> 
<P>has been employed there since 1983. He has returned to Taiwan on only one occasion, in 1980. He</P> 
<P>became a U.S. citizen in 1986, is married, and has two grown children, both of whom are native born</P> 
<P>Americans.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>In the 1990s, he inherited a 1/32 partial interest in some real estate in Taiwan. His interest</P> 
<P>is less than $4,000. In order to deal with the property, based on advice from his uncle (Tr at 23), he</P> 
<P>came to believe that it would be helpful to dispose of his interest if he had a Taiwan passport for  "identification" (Id.). He did not go to Taiwan, and never used 
the Taiwan passport for any reason.</P> 
<P>Once he became aware it was a negative factor in obtaining a security clearance, he surrendered it</P> 
<P>to Taiwan officials in 2004.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Applicant avers that "the United States is [my] country. And I don't have any thoughts about</P> 
<P>my loyalty to this country" (Tr at 22).</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Guideline C (Foreign influence)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>This concern deals with Applicant's relatives in Taiwan. His brother, who is a U.S. resident</P> 
<P>alien, has returned to Taiwan to accept a better employment offer to teach in a private high school.</P> 
<P>Applicant does not consider their relationship to be a close one. The only relative he keeps in  contact with is his uncle, who takes care of the family real estate 
in Taiwan.</P> 
<P>Guideline B (Foreign Influence)</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>2.a. - 2.c. - I have considered the presence and status of Applicant's family members and  other relatives in Taiwan and his relationship and contacts with them. 
His immediate family resides</P> 
<P>in the U.S. and his two grown children were born here. I have also considered the personal and professional life Applicant has made for himself in the United 
States since coming here in 1974. He</P> 
<P>has spent considerably more time in the U.S. than in Taiwan, and he has been there only once since</P> 
<P>he moved to the U.S. in 1974, and that was 24 years ago.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>He considers himself to be an American and much of his professional career has been in  supporting U.S. military and security interests. At age 54, there is 
absolutely no reason to question</P> 
<P>his feelings of allegiance and loyalty to the U.S. and to the interests of his family. He owes no allegiance to Taiwan or any other country. He has no intentions of 
returning to Taiwan (Tr at 35).</P> 
<P>He has no financial interests in Taiwan beyond a minimal interest (about $3,000) in a small piece</P> 
<P>of property in Taiwan. On the other hand, Applicant's net worth in the U.S. is about $3,000,000.  He does not discuss his work with anyone in Taiwan and even 
his brother there knowr only that</P> 
<P>Applicant is an engineer (Tr at 37).</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>He has introduced a letter of high praise from his department manager (AX A). He has  received several cash awards for distinguished perfon~nance (AX B and 
AX C). His work  evaluations are consistently highly positive (AX D). I find these letters and awards to be on point  and persuasive as to Applicant's character, 
dedication, and integrity.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>While any relatives in a foreign country may present a risk, the Directive does not make this</P> 
<P>factor an automatic bar to holding a security clearance. Fairness and commonsense require an  analysis of the entire record and an overall common sense 
determination. Taiwan is cited in an  official Government documents (Item 7) as a country involved in economic espionage in the United</P> 
<P>States, but the same document does not indicate the documented use of pressure applied against  individuals with relatives in Taiwan.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>The lack of any past improper contacts in the past is not evidence establishing that it will not</P> 
<P>happen in the future, but it is a positive factor that should be considered along with all other  evidence, including, but not limited to, Applicant's statement that 
his allegiance is to the United  States only. Based on the totality of the record, I conclude (1) that Applicant has done nothing to  suggest any preference for 
Taiwan, and (2) there is minimal risk that Applicant's relatives will be</P> 
<P>pressured into contacting Applicant for improper purposes. In addition, based on his long history  of residence in and dedicated service to this country, there is 
even less risk that Applicant would respond to any such contact by agreeing to act against U.S. interests.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family... are (1) not citizens of   the United States or (2) may be subject to duress. These situations 
may create the potential for  foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with  citizens of foreign countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual</P> 
<P>potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Disqualifying Condition - 1. An immediate family member.., is a citizen of, or resident or</P> 
<P>present in, a foreign country.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>Mitigating Condition - 1. A determination that the immediate family member(s) . . . in  question would not constitute an unacceptable security risk.</P> 
<P>         </P> 
<P>         </P>

<P>Formal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are</P>

<P>Guideline C (Foreign Preference)     For the Applicant</P>
