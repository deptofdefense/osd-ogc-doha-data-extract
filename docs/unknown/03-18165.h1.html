<P>Security concerns persist over Applicant's criminal conduct, drug abuse, and personal conduct over his 2000 arrest and conviction for attempted preparation of 
drugs for sale.  He misrepresented the length of time he had sold drugs to his probation officer.  Further, while he stopped using drugs in 1998, he continued his 
drug involvement by selling drugs until he was arrested in 2000.  Overall, he failed to demonstrate clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Clearance is 
denied. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant on December 3, 2004.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why the Government could not make the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-18165.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges specific concerns over criminal conduct (Guideline J), drug abuse (Guideline H),  and personal conduct (Guideline 
E).  Applicant responded to these SOR allegations in an Answer notarized on December 22, 2004, where he requested an administrative determination without 
a hearing. </P> 
<P>Department Counsel on April 20, 2005, prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) which was sent to Applicant that day. Applicant received the FORM on 
April 28, 2005, but did not respond or submit any additional information within 30 days of receipt.  Consequently, on June 15, 2005, the case was assigned to 
me. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due  consideration of that evidence, I make the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant, 26 years old, has worked as an administrative assistant for Employer #1 in State #1 from October 2000 to present.  Previously, he worked for 
Employer #2 in State #2 from August 1999 to October 2000. He completed a SF-86 security clearance application in January 2001.  (Exhibit  4)  </P> 
<P>Applicant graduated from vocational school in State #1 in July 2000 and attended community college in State #2 from 1999 to May 2000.  He is single.  His 
father lives in State #1 and his mother in State #2. (Exhibits 4, 8) </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Criminal Conduct, Drugs, and Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On his 2001 Security Clearance Application Applicant disclosed only his use of marijuana ten times from 1994 to December 1998. In his Defense Security 
Service (DSS) interview in July 2001, Applicant clarified that he smoked marijuana two times weekly on "a continuous basis" with friends from 1994 to 
December 1998.  (Exhibits 4, 9)   (SOR 2.b.)  </P> 
<P>Applicant admitted he was arrested in February 2000 in State #2 and charged with (1) Preparation of Dugs for Sale, felony, and (2) Possession of Criminal 
Tools, felony.  He was indicated in July 2000 and plead guilty in August 2000 to an amended Count (1), Attempted Preparation of Drug for Sale.  The police 
department report stated that when questioned by police, Applicant volunteered that he had "a couple bags of pot."  A police officer recovered 17 plastic bags 
containing suspected marijuana from Applicant; each bag was equally measured indicating that they were packaged for sale.  He was sentenced to six months in 
jail (suspended) and place on one year probation, fined $500. plus court costs and probation fees.  Count (2) was Nolle Prosed.  The court allowed him to serve 
probation in State #1 where he had relocated.  (Exhibits 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)  (SOR 1.a.; 2.a.)  </P> 
<P>When interviewed by the State #2 probation officer in August 2000, Applicant declared he had "just started selling marijuana that week and was planning to 
stop that day."   (Exhibit 8)   In his July 2001 DSS interview he acknowledged that, in fact, he had begun to sell marijuana in the fall of 1999 on a daily basis 
until April 2000<A HREF="03-18165.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> when he was arrested.  He stated that during his probation he has "stayed out of trouble and. . . had no adverse contact with law enforcement."  
He no longer participates in the use or selling of marijuana or any other illegal substances.  (Exhibit 9)  (SOR 2.c. and 3.a.)  </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an individual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that 
could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether to grant or continue an 
individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or absence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  </P> 
<P>Based on a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth below :</P> 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline  J</STRONG> <STRONG>- Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>E2.A10.1.1.  The Concern: </EM>A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>E.2.A.8.1.1. <EM>The Concern:  </EM>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect 
classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of 
classified information.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>E2.A5.1.1.  The Concern</EM>:  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue Applicant's access to classified information.  The Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate in order  to overcome the 
doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  
Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made 
only after an affirmative finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense 
determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Criminal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established security concerns<A HREF="03-18165.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> over Applicant's criminal conduct in  August 2000 when police officer recovered 17 plastic bags containing 
suspected marijuana from Applicant where each bag was equally measured and packaged for sale.   He plead guilty in August 2000 to an amended Count (1), 
Attempted Preparation of Drug for Sale.  He was sentenced to six months in jail (suspended) and placed on one year probation, fined $500 plus court costs and 
probation fees.  The court allowed him to serve probation in State #1 where he had relocated.  Applicant provided no evidence that he has completed probation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant asserts he was moved away from the adverse peer pressure in State #2 and relocated to a new environment, his assurance that he has matured 
is insufficient to mitigate this concern.  He failed to provide evidence, such as letters of reference, to establish that he meets any of the mitigating conditions.  
For example, he provided no evidence other than his own statements to establish MC 6 (E2.A10.1.3.6):  clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Applicant 
provided no evidence of a successful work record or evidence of how he has reformed his conduct at work and at home. Thus, Applicant has failed to mitigate<A HREF="03-18165.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
his criminal conduct.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Consequently, I conclude that the factors leading to the earlier violations may still  recur.   Hence, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the 
Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant on subparagraph 1.a. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 1. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline H - Drug Involvement</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Government established security concerns over his drug use and sales as illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual's 
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  He used marijuana regularly from 1994 to 1998 and sold marijuana from fall 1999 to his arrest in April 
2000, discussed above. Drug abuse or dependence may impair social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified 
information.  His actions fall within conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying including:  E2.A8.1.1.2.1.  (any drug abuse) and 
E2.A8.1.1.2 2. (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant mitigated<A HREF="03-18165.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> security concerns over his dated use of marijuana as there is no evidence that he returned to use drugs subsequently.   Thus, E2.A8.1.1.3.1. 
(The drug involvement was not recent.) applies.  However, concerns persist over his regular sales of marijuana and over his arrest and guilty plea as he provided 
no evidence that he successfully completed probation and is rehabilitated.  His defense that he was "coerced by the wrong crowd" is insufficient to mitigate 
these concerns.  Thus, I conclude that the factors leading to the earlier drug involvement raise concerns as he did not provide sufficient evidence in mitigation.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Hence, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule for Applicant under subparagraph 2.b. and against Applicant 
on subparagraph 1.a. and 2.c. incorporated under SOR Paragraph 2.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established security concerns over Applicant's Personal Conduct over his false statement to his probation officer with respect to the length of 
time he sold drugs which was alleged and falls within Disqualifying Condition (DC) (5):  E2.A5.1.2.5.  A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.  None of 
Applicant's explanations meet the mitigation<A HREF="03-18165.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> guidelines.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">His disclosures to the DSS agent with respect to the length of time he sold drugs contradicts what he told his probation officer and his denial in his answer.  I 
consider the DSS sworn statement more reliable as he carefully reviewed the Statement and initialed corrections; consequently I conclude the Statement is more 
reliable and accurate on the length of time he sold drugs.  Though not alleged, I note Applicant also demonstrated poor judgement as he failed to disclose other 
adverse information on his 2001 security clearance form with respect to his past drugs sales and arrest and guilty plea.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Looking at Applicant as a whole person<A HREF="03-18165.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> and considering the circumstances surrounding his conduct (E2.2.1.2), I conclude Applicant failed to provide sufficient 
evidence of a current record of rehabilitation and pertinent behavioral changes.  Overall, I conclude that he has failed to provide sufficient evidence of reform 
over these personal conduct issues.  Thus, after considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines, I rule against Applicant under 
SOR Paragraph 3 under subparagraph 3.a.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in Enclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process
