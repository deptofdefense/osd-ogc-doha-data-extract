<P>Applicant is unable to successfully mitigate the security concerns stemming from his failure to resolve an outstanding bench warrant for his arrest. Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 22, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security 
concerns under Guideline J for criminal conduct and  Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant's response (Item 3) to the SOR is dated April 7, 2004, and he 
indicated he did not wish to have a hearing.</P> 
<P>On June 21, 2004, Department Counsel submitted her written case consisting of all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This 
so-called File of Relevant Material (FORM)<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> was mailed to Applicant on or about June 24, 2004, and it was received by Applicant on July 8, 2004. Applicant 
did not submit any information within the 30-day period after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned to me on August 13, 2004. Issuing a decision in this 
case was delayed due to a heavy caseload.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The FORM also contains a police report (Item 8) that concerns a matter that was investigated in July 2001, and this matter is not alleged in the SOR. 
Accordingly, the report is irrelevant, and I have not considered it in reaching my decision. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the record, I make the following findings of fact:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 36-year-old man who is a native-born U.S. citizen. He is employed as a key operator for an aerospace company, and he has worked for this 
company since February 1998. On or about September 26, 2000, Applicant submitted a security-clearance application in conjunction  with his employment.</P> 
<P>The genesis of this case is a 1997 misdemeanor child abuse (physical) charge stemming from a domestic argument between Applicant and his then wife. 
Applicant was married on April 15, 1996, and divorced on October 20, 1997. In particular, the SOR alleges the following:</P> 
<P>In February 1997, a citation was issued against you by the [police department] alleging a January 30, 1997, instance of child abuse. On April 16, 1997, in the 
[state court] you pled no contest to Child Abuse. Your plea was held in abeyance until January 15, 1998, on condition that you pay a $100 abeyance fee, have 
no similar violations, and complete anger management and parenting classes. On October 8, 1997, a warrant was issued when you failed to complete the 
required counseling. On October 20, 1997, you pled guilty to Contempt of Court, were fined $50, and sentenced to five days in jail (suspended). On May 20, 
1998, a warrant was issued for parole violations. As of October 21, 2003, this warrant had not been satisfied.</P> 
<P>In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted this allegation with the following explanation:</P> 
<P>What you want is facts and only facts. No statement I make could change the end result. What statement I did make I already made when I was sent 
Interrogatory Letter wanting more information on the [security-clearance application]. Nothing has changed since that time.</P> 
<P>In August 2002, as part of the background investigation, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent of the Defense Security Service (DSS). The interview 
produced a sworn statement (Item 5) wherein Applicant addressed various subjects, including the child abuse incident at issue here:</P> 
<P>I was married to [my wife] and we started to experience marital problems. She filed for divorce and moved out of our residence. One day I had custody of our 
son and was babysitting for my wife. She came to pick up our son and we got into a verbal argument over the terms of the divorce. The argument escalated and 
we moved it into the back bedroom for more privacy. I was carry [sic] our son in my arms and laid him on the bed. We argued some more, she picked up our 
son and left. Later the police . . . arrived at my residence and indicated there had been a complaint filed for child abuse. My wife claimed I threw our son onto 
the bed. I deny ever abusing my son.  The police officer questioned me and left. I was later served papers charging me with child abuse. I appeared in court and 
on the advice of my attorney pled no contest to the charges. I was fined $100.00, and ordered to complete anger management course. I paid the fine, however I 
did not complete the anger management course because I didn't have any transportation to the course. I received a letter in the mail, informing me I had not 
completed the course. I appeared in court, and he cited me the contempt of court and ordered me to complete the course. I attended the course and completed it 
as required, however the instructor failed to notify the court. A warrant was issued without my knowledge. I was unaware of the warrant until I was informed by 
the agent from DSS. I intend on contacting the court in . . . and taking care of the outstanding warrant. I contact[ed] the court at . . . in an attempt to talk to the 
judge. The[y] informed me I needed to be represented by an attorney before I could get an appointment with the judge. I have contacted several attorneys and I 
am currently awaiting a reply.</P> 
<P>The two court records contained in the FORM (Items 6 and 7) indicate a bench warrant was issued on May 20, 1998. More specifically, according to Item 7, a 
probation violation affidavit was filed on April 15, 1998, an order to show cause hearing was scheduled for May 4, 1998, and Applicant apparently failed to 
appear. A bench warrant was then issued with a requirement for a $500 cash bond. Nothing in the FORM or Applicant's response to the SOR indicates that 
Applicant has resolved the bench warrant, and so, I presume the warrant for Applicant's arrest is still outstanding. </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted 
facts.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The DOHA Appeal 
Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence standard.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than 
a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden, an applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation sufficient to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>1. Guideline J-Criminal Behavior </EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">regulations, practices, or 
procedures concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline J. Starting with a misdemeanor child abuse charge in 
1997 (to which he pleaded no  contest), Applicant was subsequently found in contempt of court for not complying with the court's order, and he remains 
entangled with the court due to the outstanding bench warrant issued after he failed to appear in response to an allegation that he violated his probation. 
Although the initial misdemeanor child abuse charge does not appear to be serious, the subsequent events are troubling. These facts and circumstances are 
evidence of a history or pattern of illegal behavior that creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Given these circumstances, both DC 
1<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> apply. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline J and conclude none apply in Applicant's favor. Although the initial offense took place in 1997, 
Applicant's legal situation is ongoing as evidenced by the outstanding bench warrant. Given these circumstances, his criminal conduct is not mitigated by mere 
passage of time.<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> In addition, MC 6<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> does not apply because the  bench warrant is still outstanding. Given this circumstance, Applicant has not presented clear 
evidence of successful rehabilitation. Accordingly, Guideline J is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><EM>2. Guideline E-Personal Conduct</EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under Guideline 
E. The available evidence shows Applicant has engaged in a pattern of rule violations<A HREF="02-31497.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> based on the initial misdemeanor offense in 1997, the contempt of court 
finding in 1997, and the probation violation allegation and resulting bench warrant in 1998, which is still outstanding. Taken together, these circumstances are 
indicative of poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness. I have reviewed the relevant mitigating conditions under the guideline and conclude none 
apply. Applicant's failure to resolve the outstanding bench warrant precludes a favorable outcome for Applicant. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against 
Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching my decision, I have considered 
the record evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.</SPAN></P>
