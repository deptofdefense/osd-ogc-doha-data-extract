</P>

<P>	On February 25, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, and amended by Change 3, February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding
under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a
security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine
whether clearance should be denied or revoked. The SOR is attached. Applicant filed his Answer
to the SOR on March 27, 1997.</P>

<P>	The case was received by the undersigned on April 28, 1997. A notice of hearing was issued
on May 14, 1997, and the case was heard on May 21, 1997. The Government and Applicant
submitted documentary evidence. Testimony was taken from Applicant and three witnesses. The
transcript was received on June 2, 1997.                 .</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Following Findings of Fact are based on the documentation and testimony. The SOR
alleges alcohol involvement (Criterion G). Applicant admitted all the allegations of the SOR.<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>
Applicant admitted consuming alcohol to excess at times between 1972 and December 1996. On
August 4, 1976, Applicant (age 21) plead guilty to vehicular assault (1b). He had been drinking prior
to the arrest.<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> In September 1978, Applicant (age 23) received non-judicial punishment for operating
a motor vehicle while intoxicated. The incident took place following a farewell party hosted by his
unit. On April 24, 1981, as set forth in subparagraph 1e, Applicant (age 26) was charged with driving
while under the influence (dwi) but plead guilty to the lesser included offense of driving while
impaired. </P>

<P>	After the April 1981 alcohol-related incident, Applicant received counseling (1e).<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> On
August 4, 1983, Applicant (age 28) was again charged with dwi and received punishment under the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for operating a motor vehicle while drunk. </P>

<P>	After receiving counseling a second time (1g), Applicant (age 31) was arrested and plead
guilty to dwi on June 27, 1986. While Applicant indicates in his Answer he could recall no injury,
the arrest records reflect the vehicle he was driving struck a drainage pipe and Applicant and a
passenger suffered some minor injuries.</P>

<P>	After receiving counseling a third time following the June 1986 dwi, Applicant (age 33)
received non-judicial punishment in January 1989 for not reporting for duty. Applicant's supervisor
believed Applicant's failure to report was alcohol-related. In his Answer, Applicant admitted he
received non-judicial punishment but blamed his punishment on a personality clash with his
supervisor, who Applicant believed was ineffective at his duties. Applicant noted that immediately
after this assignment, he was assigned to a key leadership position within the same unit.</P>

<P>	Under subparagraph 1k, Applicant (age 37)  plead guilty in June 1992 (1l) to dwi and
received a deferred judgment for six months.<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> Subsequent to his fourth required assessment for
counseling (1l), Applicant (age 40) was arrested on November 11, 1995 for dwi (1m). He had a
blood alcohol level of .15%. He received a deferred sentence. Prior to his arrest in November 1995,
Applicant had recently finished his school courses and stopped and had four beers. He did not feel
impaired but recognized he made an error. (Answer)</P>

<P>	Applicant testified he stopped consuming alcohol altogether over the last few months (1n,
TR. 107) because there is no room for alcohol in his life.<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> Applicant's decision to abstain and the
reasons for abstention, must be carefully scrutinized in light of his earlier testimony reflecting he
would not engage in excessive consumption of alcohol after participating in two Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings.<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> Applicant's contradictory positions about his future alcohol use
generate a negative impact on Applicant's credibility and the depth of his commitment to maintain
abstinence in the future. His credibility is weakened even more by the absence of evidence showing
how the other parts of Applicant's life have fortified his decision to refrain from alcohol use in the
future.</P>

<P>	</P>

<P>	Witness B, certified for ten years as an alcohol and drug counselor, and also certified for
three years to perform drunk driving assessments,<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP>(7)</SUP></A> testified that he administered two alcohol tests
(during the course of a clinical interview dated May 10, 1997) to Applicant to determine whether
Applicant had an alcohol problem and/or whether he needed counseling or therapy. (TR. 53)
Although the tests revealed Applicant was a situational abuser of alcohol, the tests did not show
chemical dependency, alcoholism, substance abuse, chronic abuse, or even alcohol abuse. Because
the first test showed no interference in seven related areas of Applicant's life, witness B opined
Applicant did not have a problem with alcohol, and felt neither treatment nor counseling was
necessary, only that Applicant should watch his drinking. (TR. 72-73)<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP>(8)</SUP></A> </P>

<P>	Witness A, Applicant's civilian supervisor from September 1991 to December 1992, found 
Applicant to be one of his best employees, who needed little supervision. The supervisor never saw
any sign of an alcohol or security problem before or since Applicant's discharge from the military
in December 1992.  </P>

<P>	Witness C, Applicant's wife, has only seen Applicant drink on social occasions, or once every
four or five months in the period between 1990 and 1997. (TR. 81)</P>

<P>	Applicant presented numerous commendations for excellent performance in the military.
Applicant's Exhibit A contains commendations from 1976, 1979 and 1982. Applicant's Exhibit B
contains exceptional performance evaluations for 1994/1995 and 1995/1996 periods of performance.
Applicant's Exhibit C contains a handbook Applicant wrote in April 1997, describing a staffing
analysis for patrolling the border. Exhibit C also includes a booklet which Applicant wrote in 1995,
on the correct handling of a gun. Applicant's Exhibit D is Applicant's scholastic transcript through
the Spring of 1996.<A HREF="97-0161.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP>(9)</SUP></A> Applicant's Exhibit E includes numerous letters and awards Applicant received
while in the military.</P>

<P><CENTER><U><STRONG>POLICIES</U></STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth policy factors which must be given binding
consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors must be considered in
every case according to the pertinent criterion; however, the factors are in no way <U>automatically</U>
<U>determinative</U> of the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance
on his own common sense. Because each security case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust the entire realm of human
experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. In addition, the Judge, as the trier of fact,
must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses. Factors most pertinent to evaluation
of the facts in this case are:</P>

<P><STRONG><CENTER>Alcohol Consumption (Criterion G)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><U>Factors Against Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	1. alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence...or
other criminal acts related to alcohol use;</P>

<P>	2. alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or
impaired condition....;</P>

<P>	4. Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment; 	</P>

<P><U>Factors for Clearance</U>:</P>

<P>	None.</P>

<P>			<STRONG><CENTER>General Policy Factors (Whole Person Concept)</CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P><STRONG>	</STRONG>Every security clearance case must also be evaluated under additional policy factors that
make up the whole person concept. Those factors (found at page 2-1 of Enclosure 2 of the Directive)
include: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the
time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of
rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; and, (8) the
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive, every personnel security determination must be a fair and
impartial overall commonsense decision based upon all available information, both favorable and
unfavorable, and must be arrived at by applying the standard that the granting (or continuance) of
a security clearance under this Directive may only be done upon a finding that to do so is clearly
consistent with the national interest. In reaching determinations under the Directive, careful
consideration must be directed to the actual as well as the potential risk involved that an applicant
may fail to properly safeguard classified information in the future. The Administrative Judge can
only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence
of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative
or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must establish all the factual allegations under Criterion G (alcohol
consumption) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.
While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and
his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to the sufficiency of proof of
a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely
to repeat itself and Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The Government has made a case of alcohol consumption under Criterion G. In the 19 year
period between 1976 and November 1995, Applicant has been involved in six dwi or alcohol-related
driving offenses. After the alcohol-related offenses in 1981, 1883, 1986, and 1992, Applicant was
required to attend counseling for progressively longer periods. Subsequent to the dwi in 1992,
Applicant's counseling lasted approximately four to six weeks. Even after his fourth counseling in
1992, Applicant committed  another dwi in November 1995. The six alcohol-related offenses
between 1976 and 1995 clearly establish a pattern of excessive alcohol consumption that raises
questions about Applicant's judgment and reliability.</P>

<P>	Even though the record reflects Applicant has not regularly or habitually abused alcohol to 
the point of impaired judgment, there is ample evidence demonstrating Applicant has consumed
alcohol on a binge or episodic basis. Furthermore, under the Directive, the Government is not
required to prove an applicant is a hard core alcoholic or a habitual abuser of alcohol before initiating
action to revoke or deny clearance. Applicant's pattern of  alcohol-related incidents over 19 years
is sufficient to demonstrate excessive alcohol consumption under Criterion  G, and poses a future
risk that Applicant may negligently or deliberately fail to comply with security rules and regulations
governing the safeguarding of classified information.</P>

<P>	The testimonial opinions provided by witness B are flawed for several reasons. First, the
opinions furnished are based on insufficient information or lack sufficient foundation. Second, had
witness B reviewed more closely information from the other seven areas of Applicant's life,
including the information set forth in the SOR, he would have noted that Applicant's alcohol-related
incidents resulted in an attendance problem at work in 1989, and a recommended bar to reenlistment
in August 1992. In addition, the six alcohol-related incidents had obvious legal ramifications as
reflected by the punishment received after each alcohol-related offense.</P>

<P>	Applicant's character evidence covering his tenure in the military is very impressive. In
addition, his performance evaluations at his present employer are excellent. However, in view of
Applicant's episodic abuse of alcohol over the last 19 years, Applicant's inconsistent intentions about
his future alcohol use, and the absence of corroborative evidence to support Applicant's claim of a
lifestyle supportive of sobriety, Applicant's evidence in rehabilitation falls short of satisfying his
ultimate burden of persuasion in demonstrating he warrants a security clearance.</P>

<P><U><STRONG><CENTER>FORMAL FINDINGS</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	After a full review of the specific and general (whole person concept) policy factors set forth
in POLICIES, Formal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A> At the hearing, Applicant explained he did not answer subparagraph 1n because he believed
the allegation was too broad or ambiguous. He indicated he quit drinking in December 1996 but
decided not to tell anyone because he did not want to bring attention to himself. (TR. 107-108)
<P><A NAME="N_2_">2. </A> According to GE #3, he was driving an auto and struck a motorcyclist on a dark, deserted
road. He did not believe he injured the cyclist.
<P><A NAME="N_3_">3. </A> Applicant explained, "[Military] regulation had been implemented requiring counseling
following any alcohol related incident...After meeting with the counseling staff several times, my
commander was advised that there was no indication of a problem. At that point I was released from
the counseling program. This is the same reason for attending and the same response received each
time I attended counseling during this and subsequent events." (Answer) The counseling was
basically the same, according to Applicant, with one or two counseling sessions a week for about
two weeks. (GE #3) The last treatment consisted of weekly group sessions that lasted four to six
weeks with some individual therapy. (TR. 103)
<P><A NAME="N_4_">4. </A> Under the Directive, the deferred judgment Applicant received (state statute, section 991c)
does not negate the security significance of Applicant's underlying conduct in drinking and being
arrested for dwi. Furthermore, as a result of the dwi in June 1992, Applicant was barred from
reenlistment on August 28, 1992. (GE #3)
<P><A NAME="N_5_">5. </A> Applicant based his decision on his career, good friends (particularly his close friend who
persuaded him to attend AA and finally stop drinking) in his farming community, his church
community, and his schooling. (TR. 107-109)
<P><A NAME="N_6_">6. </A> "In '95 since the incident happened, I've attended a couple of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
courses just to see the -- actually, the first time it was suggested to me that I do that to see the other
side, and I thought well, okay. So I went to one in [the city] and to be honest, I was at first appalled
and alternately disgusted with some of the characters that I met there, and it really -- it couldn't be
further from me in one sense but to be honest, I've gone to another one since then and the people I
see there serve as a good reminder of why excessive consumption is not ever an option." (TR. 105)
<P><A NAME="N_7_">7. </A> As an assessor, witness B is certified to perform drunk driving assessments for the state to
determine whether a person is an alcoholic or problem drinker and to plan requirements for
restoration of driving privileges. He has conducted between 150 and 500 assessments. (TR. 47-48)
Witness B was asked to perform the drunk driving assessment by Applicant to determine whether
Applicant had a problem with alcohol. (TR. 36) 
<P><A NAME="N_8_">8. </A> Witness B testified that he administered two tests on Applicant to determine whether
Applicant had a problem with alcohol. Witness B considered part of his job to be like a lab
technician and stated, "... in part my job is just being the official reporter of the what the test results
are;...I take the sample and I say yes, this is what the sample shows." (TR. 66)  B's opinions that
there is no alcohol problem and treatment and counseling was unnecessary, shall not be considered
an expert opinion because of the limited foundation provided for the opinions. First, although B is
a substance abuse counselor, he is not a medical doctor qualified to make a diagnosis or prognosis
in any area of substance abuse. Second, B's practical experience as a substance abuse counselor
appears to be supervising other individuals or in arranging the most appropriate treatment, or making
sure the treatment facility has appropriate accreditation. Third, witness B interviewed Applicant and
investigated no independent sources to confirm or deny Applicant's information. Finally, witness B
administered only 2 alcohol tests during the course of the assessment.
<P><A NAME="N_9_">9. </A> Applicant is attending college to obtain a degree in business management. (TR. 90)
