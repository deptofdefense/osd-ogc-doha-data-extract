</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On March 7, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 11, 1997, and requested a hearing
before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on
ay 7, 1997.  On May 30, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of considering whether
it was clearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant's security clearance.  The
Government's case consisted of thirteen exhibits and no witnesses; Applicant relied on his own
testimony, on the testimony of two additional witnesses, and on seventeen exhibits.  A transcript
of the proceedings was received on June 9, 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted, with an explanation, the single factual allegation set forth in the
SOR under Criterion K.  I have accepted Applicant's admission and incorporate it as part of my
findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon
due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is a 65 year old, self employed, ------------------------------, who is seeking the
restoration of his secret clearance.  His resume includes 20 years of service in the United States
Navy--from which he retired in 1970, service as a civilian employee of the Department of Navy
from 1970 to September 1989<A HREF="97-0061.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> when he retired a second time,  and employment with a
Department of Defense (DoD) Contractor (Company X) from 1989 to June 1993.  His
employment with Company X was terminated in June 1993 after his security clearance had been
suspended as a result of his disclosing classified information to an official of Country A. 
Applicant had held a security clearance--up to and including top secret--for most of his
professional career.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The incident which led to the suspension of Applicant's security clearance in June 1993
occurred on or about August 26, 1992.  Applicant had traveled to several foreign countries on a --------------- trip for his employer, Company X, a technology company principally engaged in the
business of ------------------------------------------ -- ----------------------------------------- --for
installation on --------- and ----------.  One of the stops on this trip was to visit Country A, a
country in the process of building and equipping a ---------------.  Applicant called on Country A's
naval officials because his employer was interested in selling them ---------------------------------
for installation on their ---------------------.  When he met with Commander J, a naval officer of
Country A, Commander J challenged Applicant's knowledge about the electronic systems he was
attempting to sell.  He asked him why this equipment was necessary, which other countries had
this type of equipment, and he pressed for information on the technical capabilities of the signal
intelligence systems used by various countries.  In order to prove his expertise to Commander J,
Applicant prepared a three page paper which disclosed Submarine SIGNIT (Signals Intelligence)
Capabilities of at least four navies.  In a matrix layout<A HREF="97-0061.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>, this paper identified the country, the
platform type on which the equipment was installed, and the technical specifications, to include
frequency ranges currently being used. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant had used the services of a typist employed by Company Xx (a local, in-country
affiliate and distributor for Company X) to prepare this three page document.  The finished
document included several pages from Company X's non-classified marketing brochure--in
addition to the three pages Applicant had prepared.  After the document was typed, Applicant
provided a copy to a Company Xx official for delivery to Commander J the following day.<A HREF="97-0061.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant had two additional copies of this document prepared.  One copy of the
document was given to the officials of Country A's navy and could not be recovered.  One copy
was sent back to Applicant's employer and remained on the desk of the Manager for ------------------- Programs for a week or more--unsecured--before it was opened by an uncleared secretary,
and subsequently "handled and safeguarded as SECRET" in a GSA approved container.<A HREF="97-0061.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> 
Company Xx's copy of the document remained in its possession until retrieved by a cleared
Company X employee in September 1992 and burned in a local hotel room--in Country A.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In creating the three page document, Applicant admitted that he did not rely on
information he had learned or accessed during his employment with Company X.  He told the
Defense Investigative Service (DID) in November 1992 that the principal source of knowledge
for this information was his prior employment by the Department of the Navy (p.14, Govt. Exh.
2).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Subsequent review of this document by Company X officials revealed that it contained
information about the Navy SIGNIT systems of Country Z which was classified as Country Z
CONFIDENTIAL (Govt. Exh. 3).  Further review of this document was conducted by the
Assistant for Information and Personnel Security, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations,
Department of the Navy.  This review concluded that U.S. Navy information classified up to the
Secret Level was involved (Govt. Exh. 5).	</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When questioned about the incident by the DIS in early November 1992, Applicant
acknowledged that he had knowingly disclosed classified information.  His comments in the
sworn statement signed at that interview are instructive on his state of mind at the time.  He
indicated that he "was not very happy" and "did not feel very comfortable" (pp. 14, 15)<A HREF="97-0061.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> about
providing the information(in the document)to Commander J.  He admitted that he "should have
realized" the information in the document was classified (pp. 15-16).  He further admitted that he
realized disclosure of "this information was a security violation," (p.16) but turned the
information over "anyway" to prove to Commander J that he (Applicant) was an expert in signal
intelligence.  Additional evidence of Applicant's concurrent knowledge about the classified
nature of the information is found in his statement where he explained that he had stressed the
classified nature of the information to the Company Xx officials at the time the document was
being prepared (p. 16).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant now asks that his security clearance be restored because his disclosure on or
about August 26, 1992, was an isolated incident; his employer had not provided adequate
security briefings; and the information disclosed should not have been classified because it was
readily accessible in open sources widely disseminated in the public domain.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	To prove the latter point, Applicant has proffered numerous publications which
supposedly contain the same information as was in the three page document he created for
Commander J.  Two of the documents relied on bear publication dates three and five years <STRONG>after</STRONG>
Applicant's unauthorized disclosure.<A HREF="97-0061.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Since admitting to the DIS that he had knowingly released classified information to
Commander J, Applicant has revised his assessment of the information in the three page
document which he created on or about August 26, 1992.  Both in his answer to the SOR and in
testimony at his administrative hearing, Applicant asserted that the information disclosed "was
available through commercial unclassified documentation and publications, and continues to be
available through open source literature" (See answer to SOR and Tr. 42-48).  However, on cross
examination, Applicant admitted again that the information in the document he had created was
classified (Tr. 90-91).  The assessment of this information by Applicant's employer and the
Department of Navy, establish conclusively that the document he (Applicant) released to
Country A contained classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	To support his contention that the restoration of his security clearance is consistent with
the national interest, Applicant has proffered numerous letters of reference and other documents
which attest to his good character and his reputation for being attentive to protecting classified
information.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's
trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to safeguard classified information.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG>(1)       Unauthorized disclosure of classified information;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	(3)	Violations that are deliberate or multiple or due to negligence.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include actions that:</STRONG></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG></STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times"> </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">.      	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criterion K.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted that he disclosed classified information to a representative of a
foreign government.  With his admission, he acknowledges that his creation and disposition of a
classified document violated the sections of the Industrial Security Manual cited in the SOR.  He
admits that he did not protect the classified document which he had created (ISM 5-101); he admits
that he transmitted classified material to a foreign interest (ISM 5-405); he admits that he disclosed
classified information to a foreign person without proper authorization (ISM 5-507); he admits that
he did not follow the proper procedure for disclosing information to a foreign person (ISM 10-201);
and he admits that he disclosed classified information of a foreign government without the prior
written consent of that government (ISM 10-305).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has attempted to mitigate his malfeasance by claiming that it was an isolated
incident in his forty year career of handling and protecting classified information.  He also argues
that his security clearance should be restored because his unauthorized disclosure resulted from an
inadequate security briefing by his employer.  Finally Applicant contends that his security clearance
should be restored because the information disclosed  was readily accessible in publications available
in the public domain.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	There is merit to Applicant's claim that the disclosure occurring on or about August 26, 1992,
was an isolated incident.  In a lifetime of handling classified documents and information, there is no
allegation or evidence of a similar departure from the rules and regulations established for handling
and safeguarding classified information.  However, there is little merit to Applicant's other claims.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has failed to establish a causal relationship between his employer's security
responsibilities and the unauthorized disclosure which he made to officials of Country A in August
1992.  If Applicant had disclosed information which he had had access to as a result of his
employment with Company X, his argument would have an air of plausibility.  Company X bears
a responsibility for instructing its employees on how to properly handle and secure the classified
information they have occasion to access and use in the course of their employment.  Company X
is not primarily  responsible for preventing the disclosure of knowledge and information which its
employees have learned through their employment elsewhere. That is the situation here.  Applicant
did not disclose information learned during his employment with Company X.  Applicant has
admitted that he had learned the signal intelligence information disclosed to officials of Country A
during previous employment with the United States Department of the Navy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's claim--that the information disclosed to officials of Country A was/is available
from open sources--is not supported by the evidence.  The publications which Applicant has
proffered contain technical information but the information is not presented in the matrix format
which Applicant had used in the document he had prepared for Commander J. Applicant's Exhibit
G is a publication of Company Y, another manufacturer of --- equipment.  This publication compares
Company Y's --- equipment to the --- equipment of yet another manufacturer.  While this publication
contains information about equipment sensitivity, dynamic range, frequency accuracy, and makes
a number of other comparisons between the two product lines, this publication does not indicate
which navy is using their (Company Y's) system and which navy is using the system of their
competitor, nor does the publication indicate the platform (-------- or ---------) on which the
equipment is being used.  Significantly, this publication (Applicant's Exhibit G) is dated October 19,
1995, more than three years after Applicant had made the unauthorized disclosure to Country A.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Moreover, the assessments of the information in the three page document by Applicant's
employer, and by the Department of the Navy, provide persuasive evidence that the information in
that document was classified.  Contributing to the persuasive character of these assessments is
Applicant's near-in-time acknowledgment that the information was classified.  In his signed, sworn
statement to the DIS in November 1992--less than three months after the event--Applicant
repeatedly made admissions which reveal his state of mind at the time.  His professed unease at
turning the document over to Commander J can only be attributed to an awareness that information
in the document was classified.  On page 16 (Govt. Exh. 2), Applicant went so far as to admit that
he knew the information was classified, but decided to release it "anyway," because he wanted to
"prove a point;" he wanted to demonstrate his expertise to Commander J.  Applicant released
classified information to a representative of a foreign government in order to salvage his bruised ego.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Because Applicant has not had access to classified information for the past four years, there
is no basis upon which to evaluate his professed rehabilitation.  He receives no assistance from his
inconsistent interpretation of the events which led to the loss of his clearance.  In the past four years,
Applicant has vacillated between complaining about the injustice of losing his security clearance for
disclosing information that was available in open sources, and contritely admitting that he had
wrongfully and deliberately disclosed classified information to an official of Country A--in order
to repair a damaged ego. If Applicant truly does not understand the difference between equipment
specifications in a company marketing brochure, and linking specific equipment capabilities with
an on-duty --------- of a foreign navy or foreign air force, he has not learned from his mistake.  And
he has not persuaded this Administrative Judge that he has been rehabilitated.  Criterion K is
concluded against Applicant.</FONT></P>
