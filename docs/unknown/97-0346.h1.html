</P>

<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865
and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,  as amended by
Change 3, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated May 14, 1997, to the Applicant which
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and
determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</P>

<P>	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</P>

<P>	On June 11, 1997, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and requested
that his case be determined on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  The Government submitted
its File of Relevant Material on July 15, 1997, a copy of which was forwarded to Applicant with
instructions to submit material in explanation, extenuation or mitigation within thirty days of receipt. 
Applicant elected not to file a response and the case was assigned for resolution to Administrative
Judge John Erck on September 24, 1997.  On September 25, 1997, the case was transferred to the
undersigned due to workload considerations.            </P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG><U>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	After a thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
this Administrative Judge renders the following findings of fact:</P>

<P>	Applicant is a 29 year old  laborer who has worked for  a defense contractor since September
1986.  He seeks to retain a confidential security clearance which was granted to him by his employer
on commencing his job duties there.</P>

<P>	Introduced to illegal drugs while still a minor in 1985, Applicant tried cocaine twice and
hashish four times that year.  After his initial experimentation with marijuana in January 1985,
Applicant smoked that drug  with increasing frequency to where by 1988, his abuse was on the order
of three joints per day.  He continued to smoke marijuana at that same rate to March 1994 when his
consumption decreased to one joint daily.  In November 1995, Applicant returned to three joints per
day, smoking on average about an ounce of marijuana per week until June 1996.  Applicant
purchased marijuana for his personal consumption during the 1985/1996 time frame, with his most
recent consumption from November 1995 to June 1996 costing him between $100.00 to $150.00 per
week.  Applicant has never sold marijuana but purchased it for friends on occasion as a favor to
them.  </P>

<P>	Applicant began using alcohol in 1986.  The amount and frequency of his consumption
increased gradually from one or two beers twice weekly to at least twelve beers five times a week. 
He continued drinking at this rate until 1991. On an unspecified date in May 1987, local  police
observed him skid to a stop at a local convenience store.  Applicant was arrested for possession of
alcohol by a minor and possession of a dangerous weapon after an unopened six-pack of beer and
a marital arts throwing star were found in his vehicle. Applicant was fined $100.00 and given six
months to one year unsupervised probation.</P>

<P>	On March 26, 1988, a law enforcement official in state A approached Applicant who was
parked with his girlfriend with the car headlights on in a local lot.  Having consumed ten beers over
a four to five hour period, Applicant admitted to the officer that he had been drinking and he took
a field sobriety test.  Placed under arrest for operating a motor vehicle under the influence (OUIL),
Applicant took a breathalyser at the station.  While searching his belongings, the officer found half
of a marijuana cigarette.  A charge of misdemeanor possession of marijuana was added.  Applicant
was subsequently convicted of both offenses, fined $75.00 for the OUIL and $85.00 for marijuana
possession and his driving privileges in state A were revoked for ninety days.  At the time, Applicant 
had an operator's license issued by neighboring state B.</P>

<P>	After consuming sixteen beers and five shots of liquor over a five to six hour period on an
unspecified date in April 1990, Applicant was stopped by an officer in state A and administered a
breathalyser which registered .16% blood alcohol content (bac).  Charged with driving while
intoxicated, Applicant's driving privileges in state A were revoked for ninety days and he was placed
in the pretrial alcohol education system.  He was evaluated on January 14, 1991, and assigned to a
ten week group alcohol education/group counseling program (program #1).  After completing the
course on April 8, 1991, Applicant was referred for additional outpatient counseling at another
facility (program #2).  Applicant received outpatient treatment in program #2 from May 8, 1991 to
July 8, 1991, for a condition assessed as alcohol abuse. Applicant maintained abstinence while in
program #2.  Aftercare plans included abstinence and "maybe" continuation of step meetings in
Alcoholics Anonymous.  His prognosis for recovery was assessed as guarded.   At the completion
of the program, the DWI charge was dismissed.<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT></P>

<P>	Applicant resumed drinking thereafter at a rate which increased gradually to abusive levels
(twelve beers and three shots of liquor daily).  He continued drinking at this rate until 1993.</P>

<P>	On December 7, 1991, Applicant got involved in an altercation with his supervisor at work
when he attempted to leave early.  Suspected of being under the influence, Applicant was
administered a breathalyser at his workplace which registered .17% blood alcohol content.  
Applicant received a warning notice and was suspended from work for five days for violation of
regulations (being intoxicated at the worksite).</P>

<P>	After drinking twenty shots of liquor and twelve beers over an eight to ten hour period at a
holiday party, Applicant was stopped en route home on December 24, 1993, for swerving/straddling
the center line.  Smelling of alcohol with glassy eyes and slurred speech, Applicant was administered
field sobriety tests which he failed.  Applicant was arrested for OUIL and failure to drive in
established lane.  Unable to present a urine sample after two tries, Applicant was also charged with
refusal to take a chemical test and his license was suspended for six months.  An administrative
hearing was held on the refusal charge with the result there was insufficient proof of refusal and his
license was restored.   Subsequently convicted of OUIL, Applicant was sentenced to a $500.00 fine
plus $200.00 probation fee and $78.00 costs, 100 hours community service, one year probation, and 
his driver's license was suspended for one year.</P>

<P>	Over the next couple of years to November 1995, Applicant consumed alcohol at a 
significantly reduced rate of once per week.  In addition to smoking three joints of marijuana per
day, Applicant from November 1995 to June 1996 drank alcohol at an increased rate of at least six
times per week in quantity of twelve beers and three shots per occasion.  Approximately once per
week, he suffered an alcohol-related blackout.     </P>

<P>     	After imbibing twelve or thirteen beers over five hours on May 16, 1996, Applicant lost
control of his automobile on an interstate highway and struck the guardrails.  Applicant failed field
sobriety tests and was arrested for OUIL and speeding.  Prior to transporting Applicant to the state
police station, the officer performed a pat down for his own safety and found a small bag of
marijuana in Applicant's left front pocket.  Applicant was then also charged with possession of
marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.  A charge of refusal to submit to chemical test was
added when Applicant refused to submit to a breathalyser at the station.  On June 15, 1996,
Applicant's driver's license was suspended for six months on the refusal charge.  In November 1996,
Applicant was convicted of OUIL for which he was fined $500.00 plus a $200.00 probation fee and
$78.00 court fee, ordered to serve then days in a detention center, placed on two years probation and
ordered to seek alcohol counseling.  The speeding and drug charges were nolle prossed.</P>

<P>	In June 1996, Applicant on his own sought inpatient treatment in a local rehabilitation facility
(program #3).  Since his insurance would only cover outpatient, Applicant was treated as an
outpatient in program #3 from June 11, 1996 to July 12, 1996, for a condition diagnosed by  a
licensed clinical social worker as alcohol and marijuana dependence.  Prior to his admission into the
program, Applicant was abusing alcohol and marijuana on a daily basis.  Applicant willingly
attended all required psycho-educational groups where he learned about addiction and the recovery
process.  While he attended small group therapy daily, he did more work in his individual sessions
where he learned to identify personal relapse triggers.  Applicant also went to Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings but only once per week.  Encouraged to become more involved with
AA, at discharge it was recommended to him by his therapist that he attend ninety meetings in ninety
days.  In formulating his aftercare recovery plan,  Applicant would only commit to four AA meetings
weekly.  His aftercare plan included changing his friends and distancing himself from those with
whom he used alcohol and marijuana in the past.  His prognosis was noted as good provided he
complied with his discharge objectives.</P>

<P>	Applicant has been abstinent from alcohol and marijuana since June 1996 and has no intent 
to resume use of alcohol or marijuana.<FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT><STRONG><U></STRONG></U></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U>POLICIES</STRONG></U></P>

<P>	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as
to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 to the Directive sets forth
adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the pertinent criterion in
making the overall common sense determination  required.  Each adjudicative decision must also
include an assessment of the seriousness, recency, frequency and motivation for an applicant's
conduct; the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with
knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; the age of the applicant; the absence or
presence of rehabilitation, the potential for coercion or duress, and the probability that the conduct
will or will not recur in the future.  <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section F.3. and Enclosure 2.  Because
each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the
factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case. 
oreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be sufficient for an
unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a
recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally unstable
behavior. </P>
</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE="+1">	 Considering the evidence as a whole, this Administrative Judge finds the following
adjudicative guidelines to be most pertinent to this case:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION</P>

<P><STRONG>Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></P>

<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>	(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence . .
.</P>

<P>	(2) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or
impaired condition. . .</P>

<P>	(4) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment.</P>

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>	(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">DRUG INVOLVEMENT</P>

<P><STRONG>Improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair
social or occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of
classified information.</STRONG></P>

<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P>

<P>	(1) any drug abuse.</P>

<P>	(2) illegal drug possession, including. . .purchase</P>

<P>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P>

<P>	(1) the drug involvement was not recent</P>

<P>	(2) the drug involvement was an isolated or infrequent event</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE="+1">* * *</P>

<P>	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 and the Directive, a decision to grant or
continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is
clearly consistent with the national interest.  In reaching the fair and impartial overall common sense
determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and conclusions
which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  In addition, as the trier of fact,
the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.  Decisions
under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an applicant
may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Burden of Proof<STRONG></U></CENTER>
</STRONG></P>

<P>	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as
a security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present
evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence
of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance.</P>

<P>	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands the Court's rationale, doubts are to be
resolved against the Applicant.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><CENTER><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard to criteria G
and H.</P>

<P>	While  there is no evidence that Applicant had consumed any alcohol on the occasion of his
ay 1987 minor in possession offense, his underage consumption otherwise engenders concern
because it was in violation of applicable state laws.  Moreover, by <FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>March 26, 1988, his first drunk
driving offense, Applicant was clearly abusing alcohol to such an extent to be cognizable within
criterion G.  By sometime in the late 1980's his drinking had increased to twelve beers five times per
week.  After being caught operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .16% on an
occasion in April 1990, Applicant was required to attend a ten week alcohol education/group
counseling program at the completion of which he was referred to another facility for further
counseling.  Although Applicant completed this second ten week program, during which he managed
to remain abstinent,  he was given a guarded prognosis on discharge which was borne out by his
relapse into abusive drinking.   In December 1991, he was suspended from work for five days when
he was found to be intoxicated  with a .17% bac on the job.  Consistently drinking twelve beers and
three shots of liquor per day by 1993, Applicant had developed a serious alcohol problem.  During
a holiday party in late December 1993, Applicant imbibed twenty shots of liquor and twelve beers. 
While this was over an eight to ten hour period, Applicant was inebriated when he attempted to drive
home as his demeanor and driving behavior attest.  Following this, his third drunk driving incident,
Applicant limited his drinking to once per week.  But in November 1995, without an apparent
precipitant in the record, he relapsed into his previous pattern of twelve beers and three shots just
about daily, suffering alcohol-related blackouts once per week.  On March 16, 1996, he committed
his fourth drunk driving offense.  Notwithstanding his arrest for OUIL, Applicant continued to
consume excessive quantities of alcohol at least six times per week until June 1996 when he sought
treatment in alcohol program #3.  Given the extent and recency of his abusive drinking, Applicant
bears a particularly heavy burden to demonstrate reform.</P>

<P>	In assessing the current security significance of the aforesaid conduct, this Administrative
Judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines pertaining to alcohol consumption set forth in
Enclosure 2 to the Directive.  Applicant's underage possession of alcohol and his repeated drunk
driving offenses qualify as alcohol-related incidents under disqualifying factor (DF) 1.  DF 2. must
be considered as well because he was intoxicated at the jobsite on December 7, 1991.  Although the
available clinical records of his treatment in program #3 reflect Applicant was dependent on both
alcohol and marijuana, there is no evidence that the diagnosis was rendered by a credentialed
medical professional, <EM>i.e,</EM> a licensed physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board certified
psychiatrist.  The clinical supervisor who signed the discharge summary is a licensed clinical social
worker with a doctorate degree.  A licensed clinical social worker is not considered a credentialed
medical professional under the Directive.  Hence, this Administrative Judge is not persuaded of the
Government's position that Applicant's alcohol abuse must likewise be evaluated under DF 3.
(diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence). 
However, Applicant's pattern of abusive drinking, especially from the late 1980's to 1991 (twelve
beers five times per week), from about 1992 until late 1993 (twelve beers and three shots of liquor
daily) and from November 1995 to June 1996 (twelve beers and three shots of liquor at least six days
a week) falls within DF 4. (habitual or binge consumption to impaired judgment).</P>

<P>	Of the corresponding mitigating conditions (MC), the repeated nature and recency of
Applicant's alcohol-related incidents preclude favorable consideration of MCs 1. or 2.  To
Applicant's credit, following his most recent OUIL offense of May 16, 1996, he sought treatment
in an inpatient alcohol program.  With his insurance coverage limited to outpatient treatment,
Applicant entered a month long program consisting of individual and group therapy and AA
meetings.<A HREF="97-0346.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  At discharge, Applicant intended to maintain abstinence and the Government presented
no evidence of any alcohol consumption on Applicant's part since June 1996.  Applicant's
maintenance of an alcohol-free lifestyle is recognized as a positive change in behavior supportive
of sobriety (<EM>See</EM> MC 3.).  However, it is not enough in itself to persuade this Administrative Judge
that Applicant's abusive drinking is safely behind him.  Urged by his primary therapist in program
#3 to attend ninety AA meetings in ninety days following his discharge, Applicant would only
commit to four meetings per week.  In responding to the SOR, Applicant indicated the
recommendation was to attend AA a minimum of once weekly.  The available medical record belies
this claim.  Moreover, it is not clear to what extent, if any, Applicant has attended AA since his
discharge from program.  It cannot be determined from the record whether Applicant has a viable
support network in place to assist him in his recovery or indeed, whether he has complied with his
aftercare plan and objectives.</P>

<P>	Whether or not an applicant has reformed depends not only on demonstrated conduct over
a measurable period of time that he is committed to his recovery, but also on recognition and
acknowledgment of his alcohol problem.  In this case, Applicant indicated to a Special Agent of the
Defense Investigative Service during his interview of March 19, 1997, that he imbibed from
November 1995 to June 1996 twelve beers and three shots of alcohol at least six days per week with
blackout once weekly.  In his Answer, he admitted to drinking to excess only from 1989 to June
1991.  This attempt to minimize his alcohol problem calls into question the extent of his insight into
his alcohol problem.<A HREF="97-0346.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  On balance, the evidence in reform is not sufficient to overcome his very
serious history of abusive drinking.  Accordingly, subparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g.,
1.h., 1.i. and 1.j. are resolved against him.  </P>

<P>	With respect to Criterion H, Applicant abused marijuana from January 1985 to June 1996,
to include on a daily basis since at least 1988.  In addition to purchasing the illegal drug for himself
during the period of his use, on occasion he bought it for friends as a favor to them.  Applicant's
illegal drug involvement also included experimentation with hashish and cocaine in 1985.  DCs 1.
and 2. under the drug involvement adjudicative guidelines are pertinent in this case.  Although
Applicant continued to use marijuana after he had been granted a Confidential security clearance by
his employer, this Administrative Judge finds no merit to the Government's contention that DC 3.
might also apply since that factor is apposite only to current drug involvement.  Whereas Applicant
abused marijuana daily to June 1996, his marijuana abuse is regarded as recent, but not current.</P>

<P>	MCs 1. (drug involvement not recent) and 2. (drug involvement isolated or infrequent)  work
to Applicant's benefit, but only to his dated and limited abuses of cocaine and hashish.  With the
passage of more than ten years without any recurrence, there is seen little, if any, likelihood that
Applicant will abuse either of these two drugs in the future.  Subparagraphs 2.g. and 2.h. are hence
concluded in his favor.</P>

<P>	That Applicant abused marijuana daily for eight years reflects the degree to which that drug,
in contrast, had become part of his lifestyle.  Applicant indicates he has no intent to use marijuana
in the future.  For favorable consideration of MC 3., his stated intent to refrain from marijuana use
in the future must be confirmed by positive action.  Applicant claims abstinence since June 1996,
and the Government did not present any evidence to the contrary.  To his credit, Applicant received
treatment in program #3, in part, for his drug abuse.<A HREF="97-0346.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A>  <FONT SIZE="+1"></FONT>Yet, in responding to the SOR, Applicant
attempted to downplay his recent marijuana abuse by admitting only to abuse with varying
frequency, at times daily, between January 1988 and June 1991.  Again, there is no evidence that
Applicant has abused any marijuana since June 1996, and a finding to the contrary cannot be made
on the basis of a negative assessment of his credibility.   Given the extent of his past drug abuse,
which is documented, it is especially important that he show adherence to his aftercare plan which
he has not done.  Absent compelling evidence that Applicant is actively involved in his recovery,
this Administrative Judge cannot be sanguine that his drug use is safely behind him.   Applicant's
evidence in reform is not sufficient to overcome habitual marijuana abuse which continued,
unabated, while he was in possession of a company granted Confidential clearance.  Those
subparagraphs which reflect marijuana involvement on Applicant's part, to wit:  2.a., 2.b., 2.c., 2.d.,
2.e., 2.f. and 2.i. are therefore found against him.</P>
