<P>Applicant, who is 27 years old, has a close relationship with her paternal grandparents, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan.  Between 1997 and 2004, she 
traveled six times to Taiwan and visited her grandparents.  Some of Applicant's trips to Taiwan were gifts from her parents.  Since establishing herself in her 
profession and marrying a U.S. citizen, Applicant's contacts with her grandparents have lessened, even though she continues to hold them in high regard.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><EM></EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On June 12, 2006, under the applicable 
Executive Order<A HREF="04-02874.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Department of Defense Directive,<A HREF="04-02874.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns 
raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Directive.  DOHA received Applicant's written answer the SOR on July 14, 2006.  Applicant elected to 
have a hearing before an administrative judge.  On July 27, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  I convened a hearing on August 17, 2006, to consider whether it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Applicant waived the 15-day notice provision at Enclosure 
3, &para; E3.1.8. of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government called no witnesses, introduced two exhibits, and offered two documents for administrative notice.  The Government's exhibits (Ex.) were 
numbered 1 and 2, and its documents offered for administrative notice were numbered I and II. Applicant called one witness and introduced six exhibits (Ex.), 
which were identified as Ex. A through F.  All exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding 
August 28, 2006.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct charged under Guideline B, Foreign Influence.  In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one 
allegation, and denied the other. In her denial, Applicant did not deny the underlying facts of the allegation, but she disputed the purpose attributed to the 
alleged conduct in the SOR.  Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is 27 years old and employed as a test program manager for a defense contractor.  (Ex. 1, at 1-2.)  She holds bachelor of science and master of science 
degrees in electrical engineering from a U.S. university.  As a graduate student, she designed a micromachined patch antenna with wireless applications and 
presented her findings at an international microwave conference held in Japan in November 2002.  (Ex. A and Ex. B.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Taiwan.  She immigrated to the U.S. with her father, mother, and younger sister in 1994, when she was 15 years old.  With the exception 
of her paternal grandparents, who are citizens and residents of Taiwan, most of Applicant's immediate and extended family members are citizens and residents 
of the U.S. <A HREF="04-02874.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> (Tr. 61-62.)  In 1997, when Applicant graduated from high school, her parents gave her a trip to Taiwan to visit her elderly paternal grandparents, 
who had been retired since before Applicant was born. Applicant visited her grandparents in Taiwan for about two weeks.  ( Ex. 2; Tr. 50, 53-54.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant became a U.S. citizen in May 2000 and acquired a U.S. passport in June 2000.  She received her bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering 
in August 2000.  (Ex. 1; Ex. 2.)  Her parents again gave her a graduation trip to visit her grandparents in Taiwan, and Applicant spent approximately 2 &frac12; weeks 
in the summer of 2000 visiting her grandparents in Taiwan.  (Tr. 51.)  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the summer of 2002, Applicant again returned to Taiwan with her parents and other relatives to celebrate her paternal grandfather's 80<SUP>th</SUP> birthday.  She was 
one of about 100 family members and friends who participated in honoring the grandfather.  In November 2002, Applicant traveled to Japan to attend an 
international conference and to present a paper on her academic research.  On her return trip to the U.S., she stopped in Taiwan briefly to visit her paternal 
grandparents.  (Tr. 51.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In January 2003, Applicant's maternal grandmother, a U.S. citizen, found it necessary to travel to Taiwan to conduct some family business.  Because the 
grandmother was elderly and needed assistance, she could not travel alone.  She asked Applicant to accompany her on the trip and to remain in Taiwan with her 
for approximately one week while she conducted her business.  When the grandmother's business was finished, she and Applicant returned to the U.S.  (Tr. 36, 
52; Ex. C.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 2004, Applicant married a U.S. citizen she met in college.  Applicant's husband is also an engineer, and he has lived in the U.S. all his life.  Applicant's 
husband's mother has relatives who are citizens and residents of Japan.  After the wedding in the U.S., Applicant, her husband, and members of their families 
traveled to Japan and Taiwan.  Applicant's parents gave the young couple a wedding reception in Taiwan, and Applicant's husband's family gave them a 
reception in Japan. Applicant and her husband were in Japan and Taiwan for approximately two weeks before returning to the U.S.  (Tr. 44-45, 52-53, 60; Ex. 
D; Ex. F.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since her marriage, Applicant has not traveled to Taiwan.  In May 2006, Applicant's younger sister was married in the U.S. to a U.S. citizen.  Prior to the 
wedding, in February 2006, Applicant's parents gave Applicant's sister an engagement party in Taiwan.  Applicant's sister, her fianc&eacute;, the fiance's parents, 
Applicant's parents, and Applicant's maternal grandmother traveled from the U.S. to Taiwan to attend the engagement party.  Applicant and her husband did 
not go to Taiwan for the party. (Tr. 64-66.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant communicates with her grandparents in Taiwan approximately twice a year by telephone on their birthdays and on Chinese New Year.  She said her 
parents remind her to make these annual calls to her grandparents.  She denied any other contacts with citizens and residents of Taiwan. (Tr.45, 49, 74.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant asserted her paramount loyalty to the U.S. and noted that her immediate family members were all U.S. citizens and living in the U.S.  She observed 
that her family ties and loyalties in the U.S. were much stronger than those in Taiwan. (Tr. 55-56, 74-75.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has received training from her employer regarding the protection of classified information and what to do if approached by unauthorized individuals 
seeking access to classified information.  (Tr. 58-59.) </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I take administrative notice that Taiwan is a multi-party democracy and friendly to the U.S.  Since the end of World War II, Taiwan has developed a strong 
position as a major international trading power and has become the world's 17<SUP>th</SUP> largest economy.  Since acceding to the World Trade Organization in 2002, 
Taiwan has expanded its trade opportunities and further strengthened its standing in the global economy.  Taiwan enjoys considerable economic and social 
stability as a consequence of its high level of prosperity.  (Background Note: Taiwan, April 2006; prepared by the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, 
U.S. Department of State: Government Document for Administrative Notice II.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I also take administrative notice of on-going tensions between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China (PRC).  Taiwan seeks to become an independent 
State, an aspiration which is strongly opposed by the PRC, which sees Taiwan as a province of the PRC.  (<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Id</SPAN>., at 7, 10.)   Additionally, I take administrative 
notice of Taiwan's active and historic roles as collector of competitive information and perpetrator of industrial espionage against U.S. companies producing 
militarily critical technologies such as information systems, sensors and lasers, and electronics. (Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection 
and Industrial Espionage: 2000: Government Document I for Administrative Notice.)</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a 
position . . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to 
United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, 
honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to 
abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 
1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B - Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged, under Guideline B of the Directive, that Applicant's paternal grandparents are citizens and residents of Taiwan (&para; 1.a.); and that 
Applicant had traveled to Taiwan in at least 1997, 2000, twice in 2002, 2003 and 2004 to visit her paternal grandparents (&para; 1.b.).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A Guideline B security concern exists when an individual seeking clearance is bound by ties of affection, influence, or obligation to immediate family, close 
friends, or professional associates in a foreign country, or to persons in the United States whose first loyalties are to a foreign country.  A person who places a 
high value on family obligations or fidelity to relationships in another country may be vulnerable to duress by the intelligence service of the foreign country or 
by agents from that country engaged in industrial espionage, terrorism or other criminal activity.  The more faithful an individual is to family ties and 
obligations, the more likely the chance that the ties might be exploited to the detriment of the United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's case requires the recognition that Taiwan,  a democratically-governed country and a friend of the U.S., is engaged in an on-going struggle with the 
PRC regarding Taiwan's political and economic autonomy and identity.  In their efforts to gain strategic or economic advantage, some individuals and groups 
in Taiwan seek to obtain, through illegal methods, militarily critical technologies from companies doing business as government contractors in the United 
States.  These actions  threaten U.S. security interests.  American citizens who have close ties with persons who are citizens or residents of Taiwan could be 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits one of the two  allegations under Guideline B.  She admits the actions alleged in the second allegation but denies DOHA's contention that her 
six trips to Taiwan suggested close ties of affection or obligation that would raise a security concern.  On their face, Applicant's admissions raise security 
concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's paternal grandparents are citizens and residents of a foreign country, they are not immediate family members as defined by Guideline B of 
the Directive.<A HREF="04-02874.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  However, the grandparents are individuals with whom Applicant has had close ties of affection and their presence in Taiwan raises security 
concerns under E2.A2.1.2.1 of Guideline B.  Applicant's six trips to Taiwan between 1997 and 2004 suggest a closeness to her relatives in Taiwan that could 
also make her vulnerable under DC E2.A2.1.2.1. of Guideline B to coercion, exploitation, or pressure by individuals or groups seeking militarily critical 
technologies to be used by the government of Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may mitigate foreign influence security concerns by demonstrating that immediate family members or close associates are not agents of a foreign 
power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force an applicant to choose between loyalty to the foreign associates and loyalty 
to the U.S. Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1.  The evidence does not establish that Applicant's paternal grandfather and grandmother are agents of a 
foreign power. Applicant testified her grandparents were elderly and had been retired for some time before she was born.  However, she offered no evidence to 
rebut the Government's assertion that her family members in Taiwan could be exploited by groups or individuals engaged in industrial espionage or illegal data 
collection in a way that could force her to choose between loyalty to her family and the security interests of the United States.  (ISCR Case No. 03-15485, at 4-6 
(App. Bd. June 2, 2005).  Accordingly, MC E2.A2.1.3.1. does not apply to Applicant's case.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant may also mitigate foreign influence security concerns if she shows her contacts and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent.  MC E2.A2.1.3.3.  Applicant's contacts with her paternal grandparents who are citizens and residents of Taiwan were frequent and familial during 
her adolescent and student years and were supported, financed, and encouraged by her parents, who themselves had close ties of affection and obligation to the 
grandparents.  I note that Applicant's first trip to Taiwan occurred in 1997, when she was not yet a U.S. citizen, and the trip was a gift from her parents, as were 
Applicant's trips to Taiwan in the summer of  2000  and the summer of 2002.  In January 2003, Applicant's elderly maternal grandmother requested that 
Applicant accompany her to Taiwan so that the grandmother could conduct some family business there.  Applicant complied with her maternal grandmother's 
request.  In May 2004, Applicant's parents financed a wedding reception for Applicant and her husband in Taiwan.  It would appear that Applicant's brief 
private visit to Taiwan before returning to the U.S. after a business trip to Japan in the fall of 2002 was the only one of the six trips that Applicant organized 
and paid for on her own.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As she matured and established her own personal and professional life, Applicant's contacts with her grandparents in Taiwan became less frequent.  Her trips to 
Taiwan, as recited in the SOR, document Applicant's participation in a familial relationship that has necessarily changed and modified as she has become an 
adult with her own commitments to a husband, a career, and citizenship in a new country.  When her parents feted her younger sister with an engagement party 
in Taiwan in February 2006, Applicant and her husband did not attend.  Now, her contacts with her grandparents in Taiwan are infrequent but still respectful: 
she telephones them twice a year on their birthdays and at Chinese New Year, often in response to reminders from her parents.  While Applicant's relationship 
with her grandparents in Taiwan cannot be characterized as casual, clearly her contacts with them now are infrequent.  Accordingly, I find mitigating condition 
E2.A2.1.3.3. applies in part to Applicant's relationships with her paternal grandparents who are citizens and residents of Taiwan.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In order to determine whether a person is eligible for a security clearance, an adjudicator must carefully examine a sufficient period of the individual's life and 
weigh the person's conduct in light of the whole person concept.  This is especially true for young people, whose familial roles change as they mature and make 
their own life commitments.  The adjudicative process, as defined at E2.2. of the Directive, is "the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the 
whole person concept" and further requires the consideration of reliable information, favorable and unfavorable, about a person's past and present conduct.  
The following factors should be considered in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct under the whole person concept: "the nature, extent and 
seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; </SPAN>the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence." (<EM>See</EM> Directive, E2.2.1.1 to E2.2.1.9.) </P> 
 
<P>I have carefully reviewed the administrative record, Applicant's testimony, and the allegations in the SOR. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions of Guideline B, and I have evaluated Applicant's conduct over the past nine years in light of the whole person concept identified at &para; E2.2 of 
Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  I have especially taken note of Applicant's age and maturity and the circumstances and voluntariness surrounding her visits to her 
grandparents in Taiwan.  I have also assessed Applicant's credibility and have found her statements about her present relationships with her grandparents to be 
believable and consistent with her current state in life.  I conclude the Guideline B allegations of the SOR for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
