<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts he incurred between 1993 and 1996 before his divorce.  The debts total over $63,000.00 and still remain unresolved 
after some recent efforts  to contact his creditors. While Applicant is to be encouraged in identifying and contacting his creditors in the past year, his repayment 
efforts remain too uncertain facilitate any safe predictable judgments at this time about his debt resolution prospects.  Applicant fails to mitigate security 
concerns associated with his delinquent debts.  Clearance is denied.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><CENTER>      <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">          On July 24, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance, and recommended referral 
to an administrative judge for determination whether clearance should be granted or continued.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on August 22, 2003, and elected to have his case decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant was furnished the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM) on January 27, 2004, and received it on February 19, 2004.  Applicant did not respond to the FORM within the 30 days provided 
him.   The case was assigned to me April 7, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated a number of delinquent debts: eight in all that exceed $63,000.00, one of which resulted in an 
adverse judgment.  For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations, but attributed them to his divorce and imposed child support.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 54-year-old bartender for a defense contractor located on a military facility  who seeks to retain his security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in 
the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1993 and 1996, Applicant and his spouse accumulated numerous debts which had become delinquent at the time of their divorce in 1996.  Applicant 
reached a settlement agreement that allocated payment responsibility for the listed debts in the SOR to Applicant.  While Applicant has made contact with his 
creditors since the issuance of the SOR, he has had no tangible success in arranging payment with any of them.  He has not explored either bankruptcy or credit 
counseling, or otherwise provided any documented plan for resolving his debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on Applicant's  most recent personal financial statement in June 2002, he has a net monthly remainder of $974.00.  This would have enabled him to pay 
on some of his debts before the issuance of the SOR, even after making allowance for the child support he was paying to his ex-spouse.  Whether his personal 
finances have improved or deteriorated since 2002 is not developed in the record and cannot support drawn inferences one way or the other.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">DC 3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 3.  The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (<EM>e.g., </EM>loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the SOR and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have 
a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require 
the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security 
clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his spouse accrued considerable delinquent debt between 1993 and 1996.  By virtue of the settlement agreement he reached with his spouse in 
connection with their 1996 divorce, the debts listed in the SOR were allocated to him for payment.  With no documented approved substitution of obligors, 
these debts by all record accounts would have remained his responsibility on a joint and several basis, even without the settlement allocation.  The admitted 
debts exceed $63,000.00 and encompass both a mortgage deficiency (of around $45,000.00) and a personal judgment exceeding $5,000.00 that have not been 
resolved by Applicant.  None of the eight debts of concern to the Government have paid or otherwise resolved by Applicant since the issuance of the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Despite his more recent efforts to identify and work on his old debts, Applicant remains obligated to each of his creditors listed in the SOR.  On this record, two 
of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting financial obligations) and 
DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's accrued debts are accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>divorce), for the most part his finances have permitted modest 
attempts to pay on his old creditors with the resources available to him since at least 2002.  Aside from making contact with his creditors since the issuance of 
the SOR, he makes no showing of making payments or arranging settlements with his creditors. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are neither extenuated nor mitigated enough to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His assumed 
responsibility for the debts listed in the SOR occurred back in 1996 amidst no identified unusual circumstances, save for his divorce.  Since returning to work, 
he has had ample opportunity pay or address his debts with the resources available to him.  Extenuation is not demonstrated sufficiently to enable him to invoke 
C 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) of the Guideline.  Nor do his post-SOR efforts to date in contacting his creditors reflect the strength of 
commitment necessary to enable him to invoke any of the other mitigating conditions of the Guidelines, primarily MC 6 (initiated a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors).   <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-33581 (July 20, 2004).  Further, where applicant repayment efforts are lacking after the conditions that contributed 
to his delinquent debts have passed, the Appeal Board has cautioned against excusing the applicant from addressing his delinquent debts (even those accrued 
because of extenuating circumstances).  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (September 2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To Applicant's credit, he has since taken steps to identify his creditors and accept responsibility for some of his debts.  At the same time, he provides no viable 
repayment plan with his current resources.  And his efforts to date are not of sufficient strength to enable him to mitigate security concerns associated with his 
longstanding delinquent debts. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his debts in the past, and 
recent efforts in identifying and addressing his debts, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through  1.h. of the allegations 
governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E: 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
