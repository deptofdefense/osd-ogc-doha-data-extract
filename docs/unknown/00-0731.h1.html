<P>Applicant's bankruptcy three and a half years ago discharged Federal and state tax claims for tax years 11+ years ago and was mitigated by his

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>On March 7, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant which detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for the Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  In a sworn written statement, dated March 26, 2001, the Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR and 
elected to have his case decided on a written record, in lieu of a hearing. </P> 
 
<P>The Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) dated September 13, 2001, and received an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  The Applicant responded to the FORM on October 4, 2001, and his 
response was admitted into evidence without objection on October 11, 2001.  The Department Counsel submitted on November 16, 2001, a 
memorandum in response to the FORM response.<A HREF="00-0731.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The record in this case closed on November 16, 2001.  The undersigned Administrative 
Judge received the case assignment on November 26, 2001.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following two guidelines: paragraph 1, Guideline F (financial 
considerations), and paragraph 2, Guideline E (personal conduct).  The undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the following Findings of Fact:</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant is a 52-year-old ship's engineer employed by a U.S. Government contractor since April 1997.  He applied for a Secret personnel 
security clearance when he was employed in 1993-94 by a predecessor firm to his current employer.  The Applicant seeks to obtain a Secret 
personnel security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was married during 1967-82; the couple has two daughters, ages 33 and 31.  The Applicant married again in 1984.  FORM item 4.  
From 1980 to 1986 the Applicant owned a video rental business in the United States.  On his annual tax returns he claimed a 10% investment tax 
credit on items purchased for the business.  In 1987/88 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited the firm's books and disallowed the 10% 
investment tax credits.  This resulted in a claim by the IRS of over $200,000 in additional taxes for tax years 1983-85.  FORM item 5.  In August 
1987 the Applicant and his wife purchased a house in the Bahamas and applied for permanent residence there.  FORM item 4, page 5.  He and 
his attorney vigorously contested the IRS claim and were in continuous negotiation with the IRS until about 1990 when he settled the claim for 
about $80,000 and sold his U.S. house and business.  FORM item 5.  The Applicant sold the rest of his property in the United States in 1990.  
SOR answer.  The state taxation authority in the state of his former residence also claimed an unknown amount of back taxes for tax years 1983-1990.  FORM item 7, page 20.  When he was hired in April 1993 in the Bahamas, the IRS revived its tax claim against the Applicant--this time 
for about $60,000 or less--for tax years 1983-85 <EM>and </EM>tax year 1990.  In 1994 he and his attorney again settled the IRS claim for about a $2,000 
to $4,000 payment.  In 1997 the IRS again revived its tax claim against the Applicant, now claiming $206, 000 for tax years 1983-85 and 1990 
and started the process to garnish his wages ($6.40 per hour).  Principally to forestall the garnishment action that was about to commence and to 
discharge him from these Federal and state tax claims, the Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 1997.  Their 
bankruptcy petition, listing the above-mentioned Federal and state tax claims, was granted in March 1998.  FORM item 5.  A year later in March 
1999, the Applicant filled out and signed a security clearance application (SF-86).  The SF-86 listed the November 1997 bankruptcy petition; the 
Applicant answered "no" to the other financial questions on the SF-86, namely, no garnishments, repossessions, tax liens, unpaid judgments, 
significantly delinquent debts, or civil court actions since March 1992.  FORM item 4, pages 8-9.  He did not report any garnishments because his 
wages had not yet been garnished when in filed the bankruptcy petition.  FORM response, page 3.</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant was interviewed in July 1999 by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent concerning his bankruptcy and four Federal tax liens that 
a credit report produced by the agent<A HREF="00-0731.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> apparently showed were filed against the Applicant "from Dec[ember] 93 to Jul[y] 94."  FORM item 5, 
page 1.  The Applicant signed a statement for the DSS agent that said:</P> 
 
<P>With regards to the Federal Tax Liens that are included in my credit bureau report, I want to make clear that I had no knowledge of those liens 
until I was informed of them during this interview.  Those liens should have been removed as a result of the bankruptcy.</P> 
 
<P>FORM item 5, page 2.  </P> 
 
<P>The SOR was issued on March 7, 2001, alleging bankruptcy (&para; 1.a), past due Federal and state taxes (&para; 1.b through &para; 1.f), a personal financial 
statement showing a $2,298 net monthly remainder (&para; 1.g), and deliberate falsification with intent to conceal Federal tax liens on the Applicant's 
arch 1999 security clearance application (&para; 2.a).  The Applicant's SOR answer denied all allegations with explanations<A HREF="00-0731.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and enclosed, <EM>inter 
alia</EM>, a copy of their Application for Taxpayer Assistance Order (Form 911), asking the IRS to inform DOHA that he and his wife were current on 
their Federal taxes as of December 31, 1999.  On April 23, 2001, the IRS wrote a letter to DOHA stating that "[b]ased on" the discharge in 
bankruptcy, the couple's 1040 tax liabilities for 1983, 1984, 1985, and 1990 "were discharged" and that the IRS has adjusted their records "to 
reflect that these periods have been discharged."  FORM item 10.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an 
individual's security eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance 
(Disqualifying Conditions or DC) and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified 
information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully 
considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular case.</P> 
 
<P>The guidelines, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case are:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>GUIDELINE F - FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>[1st] A history of not meeting financial obligations; </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>[1st] The behavior was not recent; </P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>GUIDELINE E - PERSONAL CONDUCT</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying also include:  </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>    [2nd] The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal 
history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security 
clearance eligibility or trustworth-iness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; </P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>None applicable.</P> 
 
<P>The Directive also requires the undersigned to consider, as appropriate, the factors enumerated in Section 6.3:</P> 
 
<P>a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P> 
 
<P>c. Age of the applicant.</P> 
 
<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the 
consequences involved.</P> 
 
<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>f. Probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 to the Directive provides that the adjudicator should consider the following factors:</P> 
 
<P>The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledge-able participation</P> 
 
<P>The frequency and recency of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The voluntariness of participation</P> 
 
<P>The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes</P> 
 
<P>The motivation for the conduct</P> 
 
<P>The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress</P> 
 
<P>The likelihood of continuation or recurrence</P> 
 
<P>Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance 
may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly consistent</SPAN> with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall 
common sense determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and 
logical basis in the evidence of record.  Determinations under the Directive include consideration of the risk that an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on 
October 14, 1995.</P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has 
said:</P> 
 
<P>"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence standard 
without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the interests of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government to support the denial [of a 
security clearance] by a preponderance of the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the Board in second-guessing the agency's 
national security determinations."</P> 
 
<P> <EM>Dept. of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go 
to the minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM></STRONG> of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, 
substantial evidence but something less than a preponderance of the evidence--rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error 
below.<A HREF="00-0731.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through 
evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case or through evidence of affirmative defenses.  Assuming the Government's 
case is not refuted, and further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail 
to safeguard properly classified information, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold 
a security clearance.<A HREF="00-0731.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, the undersigned concludes that the Applicant 
successfully rebutted and overcame the Government's case with regard to Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations to the IRS.  This falls within the scope of DC #1, which is identified on page 4 
<EM>supra</EM>.  However, this was not due to his inability to meet them, but he was unwilling to pay IRS claims without argument, IRS claims that were 
repeatedly compromised by the IRS for less than its original claims.  Whether those claims were wholly justified or not is not addressed in this 
decision.  Security clearance procedures do not involve the interpretation--or the enforcement--of the IRS Code of 1954 or the IRS Code of 
1986.  Nevertheless, the IRS recognizes (FORM item 10) that any 1040 tax liabilities it asserted regarding tax years 1983-85 and 1990 against 
the Applicant and his wife were discharged in March 1998.  In mitigation, the Federal and state tax claims listed in their 1997 bankruptcy petition 
were extinguished over 3&frac12; years ago.  This falls within the scope of MC #1, which is also identified on page 4 <EM>supra</EM>.  More importantly, the 
evidence shows that the Applicant has little debt now and is current in his payments on it (see footnote 2 on page 3 supra).  An individual who is 
financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant is clearly not such an individual.  Therefore 
SOR &para; 1.b through &para; 1.g are concluded favorably to the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant and his wife filed for bankruptcy four years ago, not because their lifestyle exceeded their wealth or for other financially irresponsible 
reasons, <EM>e.g.</EM>, gambling, substance abuse, profligate spending, <EM>etc</EM>., but principally to clear up their tax liabilities from the time they lived in the 
United States.  Absent other present security concerns, it is unlawful to deny or revoke a personnel security clearance <STRONG>solely </STRONG>because of a single 
bankruptcy.  <EM>See </EM>11 <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">U.S.C.</SPAN> &sect;525.  On the other hand, the exercise by an applicant of his or her right to seek the protection of the bankruptcy 
laws of our country does not preclude consideration of the security significance of his or her overall history of financial difficulties.  ISCR Case No. 
98-0349 (February 3, 1999) at 3; ISCR Case No. 00-0516 (December 7, 2001) at 5; ISCR Case No. 00-0345 (December 12, 2001) at 3.  
This Applicant does not have an overall history of financial difficulties that has <EM>present </EM>security significance.  Therefore SOR &para; 1 (financial 
considerations) is concluded favorably to the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, the undersigned concludes that the Applicant 
successfully refuted and overcame the Government's case with regard to Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">SOR &para; 2 (personal conduct) alleges that when the Applicant signed his SF-86 in March 1999, he "knew well and sought to conceal" that he had 
tax liens placed against him since October 1993.  While they Applicant is clear in his DSS statement (FORM item 5, July 1999) and in his SOR 
answer (FORM item 2, March 2001) that he did not know of the existence of any Federal or state tax liens, his statements do not preclude a 
contrary finding of fact, even though they are unrebutted, if based upon reasonable inferences from facts in evidence.  The tax liens were placed 
during the October 1993-July 1994 period when the Applicant was living in the Bahamas.  FORM item 6.  No levy was effected on those liens.  
The Applicant understood in November 1997 that the IRS was attempting to garnish his wages, not that the attempt logically involved tax liens.  If 
the Applicant had known about the tax liens and had sought to conceal them in March 1999, common sense suggests that he would not have listed 
his 1997 bankruptcy on the SF-86 that in turn identified back taxes for over 90% of the total liabilities.  FORM item 7.  Moreover, he had little 
motivation a year later to "conceal" prior tax liens that should have been released upon his discharge in bankruptcy in March 1998 consistent with 
11 <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">U.S.C.</SPAN> &sect;523(a)(1)(A).  Common sense and an applicant's motivation must be considered in making clearance decisions.  <EM>See </EM>Section 6.3 of 
the Directive.  DC #2 under Guideline E (personal conduct), identified on page 5 <EM>supra</EM>, requires that errors made on personnel security 
questionnaires must be "deliberate" in order to raise a security concern and be potentially disqualifying.  Here the omission of listing prior tax 
liens--that should have been released anyway--on a March 1999 SF-86 was clearly inadvertent, unknowing, and not deliberate.  Therefore, 
SOR &para; 2 (personal conduct) is concluded favorably to the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative 
process discussion at enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on pages 5-6 <EM>supra</EM>.  The nature and extent of the Applicant's 
alleged back tax obligations are less serious when viewed in the context of the surrounding circumstances.  The lack of recency of these tax 
obligations, his financial stability, and his motivation weigh in his favor.</SPAN></P>
