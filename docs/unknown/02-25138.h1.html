<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	On September 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in
essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline H, for drug
involvement. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on October 27, 2003,
and requested a hearing. Applicant admitted the four SOR allegations.<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2004. A notice of hearing was issued on January
13, 2004, scheduling the hearing for February 5, 2004.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled. 
The government submitted seven documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as
Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7, and admitted into the record without an objection. Applicant
testified, called two witnesses, and submitted thirteen documentary exhibits that were marked as
Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-13, and admitted into the record without an objection. The transcript
was received by DOHA on February 18, 2004.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a
thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits and testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant is 46 years old, a high school graduate, and the father of two adult children. He 
married the mother of his children in December 1981, and they were divorced in January 1991. He
is presently engaged to be married. He has worked as a painter for most of his life, and has been
employed by his present employer, a defense contractor, since April 1988. Initially hired as a
maintenance painter, Applicant was advanced to the lead painter position in the structures shop
thirteen years ago, and has worked in that supervisory role ever since. He presently supervises eight
painters. The testimony, certificates, and letters of recommendation and appreciation he submitted
attest to his reputation as an excellent employee and co-worker, who is considered to be reliable,
conscientious, trustworthy, and of great moral character.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant has possessed a secret security clearance since 1991. There is no evidence that any
prior action has ever been taken to revoke or downgrade his clearance or that any complaints or
allegations have ever been made against him alleging mishandling of classified material.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant held a party to celebrate his engagement, his birthday, his sister's birthday, and his
sister-in-law's birthday in October 2000. The party was held at his fiance's house, commenced on
Friday evening, and continued until sometime Sunday morning. In the early AM hours on Sunday,
Applicant was intoxicated and seated in an outdoor hot tub with other partygoers. Someone passed
one or more marijuana cigarettes around, from which Applicant took three to four hits. Applicant
denies using controlled substances, on any occasion, either before or after this party.     	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant was improperly directed to submit to a urinalysis by his employer on October 17,
2003 after he went to his employer's safety department to open a claim because of a probable work-related shoulder injury. He tested positive for the presence of THC, and was suspended from work
for one week with pay. He was also directed to obtain a substance abuse evaluation, which he did
on November 1, 2000. He was assessed to be a low risk for being diagnosed chemically dependent,
but it  was recommended he attend an eight-hour alcohol and drug education program. He completed
the recommended program on January 13, 2001. Applicant was allowed to return to work on October
27, 2000, subject to being placed in a probationary status for two years. </SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's
eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and
Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the
Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against
clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever
a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline
H, pertaining to drug involvement with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has
the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is
something less than a preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present
substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but
less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden
shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the
case against him.<A HREF="02-25138.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">	</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H, illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. Involvement with or use of an illegal drug
indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Cleared employees must respect regulations
whether they agree with them or not. If they do not respect the rules on illegal substances, they may
not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

he worked for a defense contractor and possessed a security clearance. Disqualifying Condition (DC)
1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse </EM>applies in this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Considering Applicant's appearance and demeanor while testifying, the substance of his
testimony, and the numerous attestations to his honesty and trustworthiness that are contained in the
record, I find his claim that this was the only time he has ever abused a controlled substance to be
credible. He received a favorable drug evaluation, successfully completed the recommended drug
education program, has convincingly asserted he will never again abuse drugs, and has successfully
completed the probationary period he was placed on by his employer. Mitigating Conditions (MC)
1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>; MC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was an isolated or
aberrational event</EM>; and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">apply in
this case.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">	Applicant's use of a controlled substance after being granted a security clearance is troubling.
However, considering the situational and aberrational nature of the occurrence, all relevant and
material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in
¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions,
I find that Applicant has mitigated this security concern.  Guideline H is decided for Applicant.  </SPAN></P>
