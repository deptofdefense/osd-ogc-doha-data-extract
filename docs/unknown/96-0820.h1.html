<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>On November 7, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865, "<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>," dated February
20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 <EM>"Defense
Industrial</EM> <EM>Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>" (Directive) dated January 2, 1992, as
amended by Change 3, dated February 13, 1996, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to
Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary determination that it
was clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A copy of the SOR is attached to this Decision and included herein by reference.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 26, 1996, and requested a
hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was reassigned to this Administrative
Judge on January 15, 1997 after having been previously assigned to another Administrative
Judge on December 23, 1996.  On February 5, 1997, a hearing was convened for the purpose of
considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national security to grant, continue,
deny, or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  The Government's case consisted of nine
exhibits and no witnesses; Applicant relied on six exhibits and his own testimony.  A transcript
of the proceedings was received on February 12, 1997.</FONT></P>

<P><U><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has admitted with explanation all of the factual allegations pertaining to
alcohol consumption set forth under subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. of Criterion G.  Applicant's
admissions are hereby incorporated as findings of fact.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant is a 49 year old employee of a defense contractor.  He has held a secret
clearance for 27 years and is seeking to retain a clearance at that level.  A favorable preliminary
determination could not be made because of his alcohol consumption.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's use of alcohol began when he joined the U.S. Navy at age 18.  He went
through basic training in a state where the legal drinking age was 18--so he drank beer like the
rest of the sailors (Tr. 38).  He continued to drink every weekend through the early years of his
naval career.  When his unit deployed to Vietnam in early 1971, he would drink after every
mission<A HREF="96-0820.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A>  with the other members of his crew (Tr. 40).  He soon realized that his tolerance for
alcohol was much higher than that of most of his associates; he could drink a lot more and not
appear intoxicated.  After Vietnam, he became an instructor at a naval flight school in the U.S. 
He would occasionally drink after classes during the week, but mostly he drank every weekend
with students and other instructors.  His tour as a flight instructor was followed by a three year
tour of duty in Europe.  His drinking during this tour was curtailed because of long duty hours. 
He would go for periods of time without drinking but would then drink to the point of
intoxication on his occasional day off.  When he left Europe in 1981, he received the ----------------------, was ------------------ for his command, and was runner-up for ----------------------------------.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Back in the U.S. after his European tour, Applicant was in a 9-5 job for the first time in
his Navy career. Except for occasional road trips--for as long as six weeks--when he did not
drink, Applicant was drinking daily.  When he was having trouble sleeping and began to verbally
abuse his wife, he told his command he needed help (Tr. 44).  In January 1985 when he was
screened by a military hospital, he was drinking up to a "fifth of liquor" daily (Gov. Exh. 9). 
After he was "found to be alcohol dependent," he was admitted to a military alcohol
rehabilitation center on February 10, 1985.  He remained in that facility until March 27, 1985
(Gov. Exh 8).  He stopped drinking for a six months after being discharged from the
rehabilitation facility (Tr. 64), but then began to drink again because he was not convinced that
he really had a problem with alcohol (Tr. 45).  Applicant continued to consume alcohol until
November 1987.  He is unable to remember a specific reason why he quit at that time; he recalls
only that "a light went on," and he stopped drinking on his own "just by biting the bullet or white
knuckling it" (Tr. 58).  He became active in AA and attended meetings daily for the first six
months of sobriety (Tr. 46).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant retired from the Navy in 1989 and continued to live in State A, the location of
his last Navy assignment.  In 1992, he became concerned about the crowd with whom his
teenage daughter was associating.  When he was offered a job in State B--at a location several
hundred miles from where they had been living--he accepted the job hoping to remove his
daughter from her undesirable friends.  They moved to State B; however, his daughter was very
unhappy at the new location and went back to State A to finish high school and be with her
friends.  In March 1994, Applicant learned that his daughter was pregnant, and that the father of
the child was a reputed drug dealer.  About the same time, he learned that his wife had been
spending money irresponsibly and had fallen substantially behind in paying their bills (Gov. Exh.
2).  Applicant's wife was being treated for depression and had been taking the prescribed drug,
Prozac, with poor results (Tr. 99).  Applicant began drinking again--five or six drinks per day
(Gov. Exh. 2). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	When he voluntarily admitted himself to an addictions treatment program at Facility X on
August 1, 1994, he reported--to the treating facility-- that he had been drinking a quantity of
vodka  daily (Gov. Exh. 5).<A HREF="96-0820.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A>  The final diagnosis at the time of his discharge on August 6, 1994
was: "alcohol dependence mild to moderate."  He attended AA and did not drink for several
weeks.  Then a combination of work and family related stressors caused him to begin drinking
again.   He was readmitted to Facility X on October 11, 1994 and remained there until October
14, 1995.  The final diagnosis at the time of second discharge was: "alcohol dependence,
moderate to severe. Alcoholic organic brain syndrome<A HREF="96-0820.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> on arrival; in remission."  The prognosis
was: "Poor."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	After his second discharge from Facility X, Applicant continued to consume alcohol at
social events (Tr. 104) for the next 14 months.  He would drink a couple of beers or several
glasses of wine at social gatherings.  He does not recall that he ever drank to the point of
intoxication during this time.  In December 1995, he become involved in AA and decided that it
was appropriate time to stop drinking completely.  He had a glass of wine at Christmas 1995, and
has not consumed any alcohol since that time.  His wife has never consumed alcohol, and they do
not currently keep alcohol in their home.  He currently attends AA three times a month and finds
additional support from other recovering alcoholics with whom he communicates on the Internet
through his personal computer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has been married for 26 years.   He and his wife have reconciled with their
daughter who became pregnant out of wedlock.  She and her son now live with them while she
pursues a degree in nursing. His wife has changed doctors and is now being successfully treated
for bi-polar disorder with a different medication.  Applicant describes her improvement as being
"incredible" (Tr. 99).  Although he has experienced considerable stress during the past year
because of numerous layoffs<A HREF="96-0820.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A> due to cuts in funding for the programs on which he has been
working, he has not been tempted to consume alcohol (Tr. 84-86).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has an excellent work record.  He received superior ratings for the last rating
periods prior to his retirement from the Navy, and his most recent evaluation from his civilian
employer has been excellent. His dedication and intellect have been regularly recognized and
rewarded.</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive are not a set of inflexible rules of procedure. 
Instead, they are to be applied by Administrative Judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye
toward making determinations with reasonable consistency that are clearly consistent with the
interests of national security.  In making those overall common sense determinations,
Administrative Judges must consider, assess, and analyze the evidence of record, both favorable
and unfavorable, not only with respect to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines but in the context
of the factors set forth in section F.3. of the Directive as well.  In that vein, the government not
only has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the SOR, it must also
demonstrate that the facts proven have a nexus to an applicant's lack of security worthiness.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The following Adjudicative Guidelines are deemed applicable to the instant matter.</FONT></P>

</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><FONT FACE="Times">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying:</STRONG></FONT></P>

for a period of at least 12 months, and  received a favorable prognosis by a

<P><FONT FACE="Times"><CENTER><STRONG><U>Burden of Proof</CENTER>
</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">	</STRONG></U>The Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons.  If the Government establishes its case, the burden of persuasion shifts to
the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or
extenuates the disqualifying conduct and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  Where the facts proven by the
Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the
applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. 
As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should
err, if they must, on the side of denials."  As this Administrative Judge understands that Court's
rationale, doubts are to be resolved against an applicant.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG><U><FONT FACE="Times">CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Having considered the record evidence in accordance with the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case with regard
to Criteria G.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the
factors enumerated in Section F.3, as well as those referred to in the section dealing with the
Adjudicative Process, both in the Directive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	The Government has met its burden with respect to Criterion G.  The evidence establishes
that Applicant abused alcohol regularly from 1967 to 1987, from March 1994 to August 1994, and
for several weeks preceding October 11, 1994.  He has been diagnosed as alcohol dependent by the
health professionals who treated him at the Navy rehabilitation facility in 1985, and by the health
professionals who treated him at Facility X in August and October of 1994.  Applicant admits that
he is an alcoholic (Tr. 57). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	After carefully considering all of the evidence, particularly Applicant's testimony, this
Administrative Judge concludes that the security concerns raised by his past excessive alcohol
consumption have been mitigated. While he did not receive a favorable prognosis from a
credentialed</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">medical professional when he was last treated for alcohol dependence, the quality of Applicant's
recovery since being discharged from Facility X in October 1994 persuades me that a revision of the
"poor" prognosis would now be warranted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	At the time of his administrative hearing, Applicant had not consumed any alcohol since
December 1995-- more than 13 months.  Applicant had consumed--but not abused--alcohol in the
14 months preceding December 1995.  The steps that he has taken since his last treatment for alcohol
dependence have considerably reduced the likelihood that he will suffer another relapse.  He
understands why he began drinking in March 1994 and has been working to establish a support
network which will help him prevent a recurrence.  Applicant has worked at, and succeeded in
improving the family relationships that had been the source of the stress which caused him to begin
drinking in March 1994.  He and his wife have received counseling from their church to help them
work through their problems.  His wife's bi-polar condition is now being successfully treated with
a prescribed medication.  He has reconciled with his daughter and has accepted her and his grandson
back into the family.  His wife, his daughter, and his grandson are now part of his support group and 
people with whom he feels comfortable talking over his problems. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant has also re-established a meaningful connection with AA.  He attends meetings
regularly at chapters with members with whom he feels compatible.  Previously, he had not been
active in AA since moving to State B.  He has identified an additional source of support in the
recovering alcoholics he has been in contact with through the Internet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Applicant's recovery program appears to be working.  He has not consumed any alcohol for
more than 13 months.  And he has been abstinent during a time when he has experienced
considerable stress as a result of his employer's laying off most of Applicant's co-workers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">	Favorable consideration has also been given to Applicant's excellent work record as a
member of the U.S. Navy, and as an employee of a defense contractor.  Except for a brief period of
time in 1994,<A HREF="96-0820.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> there is no evidence that Applicant has ever allowed his problem with alcohol to
interfere with his work.  His professionalism and sense of duty have prevailed.  Even when he was
abusing alcohol, he demonstrated the self discipline to abstain at times which were critical to the
completion of his duty assignments.  This evidence together with the fact that Applicant sought
treatment on his own before he had been involved in a traffic accident or other alcohol-related
misconduct help to allay the security concerns raised by Applicant's past abuse of alcohol.  When
he began drinking in 1994, it was months, not years before he sought treatment.  His rehabilitation
since treatment--as evidenced by positive life style changes--have substantially reduced the
likelihood that there will be a recurrence.  Criterion G is concluded for Applicant.</FONT></P>
