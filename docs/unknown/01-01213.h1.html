<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On August 16, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make 
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 15, 2001, and requested a decision without a hearing.  On December 11, 2001, the Applicant 
requested that he be given a hearing.  The case was received by the undersigned on December 14, 2001, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on January 7, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A hearing was held on January 31, 2002, at which the Government presented six documentary exhibits, and called one witness.  Testimony was taken from the 
Applicant, who also submitted nine exhibits.  The transcript was received on February 12, 2002. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 44, single, and has a high school diploma.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an avionics technician, and he seeks to obtain a DoD 
security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The 
following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and criterion in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the exhibits and the 
live testimony.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal 
drugs.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant first began using marijuana in the 1970s.  He used it at varying frequencies until Spring 2000.  The Applicant testified that his use had no set 
pattern and would range from daily to twice a week.  He would smoke marijuana to calm down.  The Applicant admitted that he used marijuana for several 
months after being interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) agent in December 1999.  (Transcript at 43-45.)  The Applicant has not used marijuana for 
about a year and a half and evinces a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admitted that in 1974 he was arrested for possession of marijuana.  (Transcript at 65.)  The record also shows that the Applicant received non-judicial punishment for possession of marijuana in 1976, while on active duty with the United States Armed Forces.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  The Applicant 
also admitted purchasing marijuana on an occasional basis during the entire period that he was using it.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 2 (Guideline G - Alcohol abuse)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses intoxicants 
to excess.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant consumed alcohol to excess during the period from 1977 to December 1999.  He admits that during that period he was a problem drinker and an 
alcoholic.  (Transcript at 53.)  He admits that he had one alcohol related arrest while a minor in 1977.  A lot of his drinking was in the form of self-medication 
as the Applicant has suffered  from a Bipolar disorder first diagnosed in 1990.  (Applicant's Exhibits B and C.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's psychiatrist states, "[The Applicant's] diagnoses are Bipolar Disorder and there is a history of Alcohol Abuse and Dependence. . . .  He has 
been active in psychotherapy and is mostly sober."  (Applicant's Exhibit B.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because of his drinking, and the Bipolar disorder he suffers from, the Applicant has been hospitalized three times between 1987 and 1999.  These 
hospitalizations were short-term in nature, usually not lasting more than a week.  The Applicant does not believe that any of the hospitalizations included 
treatment for Alcohol Abuse.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has reduced his drinking considerably.  When the Applicant drinks, he does not drink to excess.  He intends to continue cutting down his 
drinking and hopes to stop drinking in the future.  (Transcript at 53.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged 
in criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1994 the Applicant was on medication for his Bipolar disorder.  In early August he stopped taking his medication for several days.  As a result, the Applicant 
began suffering from manic episodes.  The end result were arrests on August 13 and 14.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)  The police thought that the Applicant 
was intoxicated at the time.  The Applicant maintains that he was not and, after the second episode, he was hospitalized.  He eventually received a suspended 
sentence and was given a small fine.  He has not been arrested since.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 4 (Guideline E - Personal conduct)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally 
falsified material aspects of his personal background during the clearance screening process. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On June 18, 1999, the Applicant completed an official DoD questionnaire in which he stated that he had never been charged or convicted of any offenses 
related to alcohol or drugs.  (Government Exhibit 2 at Question 24.)  This was a false answer to a relevant question concerning the Applicant's criminal history.  
The Applicant subsequently admitted that he had been charged with Possession of Marijuana and Driving Under the Influence of Narcotics in 1974.  He also 
admitted being charged with Minor in Possession of Alcohol in 1977.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Concerning his failure to admit his drug and alcohol related arrests, the Applicant stated. "I admit I was not honest on the EPSQ by not reflecting full and 
accurate information.  I feared it would hurt my chances of getting a clearance if the full extent of my problems were known.  I admit this dishonesty by me was 
an intentional and willful act.  I will be honest in all future security forms I fill out."  (Government Exhibit 1 at 3.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing the Applicant attempted to disavow this sworn statement, alleging that the DSS may have overstated the case.  In addition, the Applicant stated 
that he had considerable difficulty filling out the computerized form, as he was not computer literate at that time.  (Transcript at 68-70.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government also alleges that the Applicant falsified Question 26, which asks about certain offenses which occurred in the seven years preceding the date of 
the questionnaire.  The Applicant admitted that he had been arrested on August 13, 1994, and charged with Interfering With a Police Officer and Littering on 
Public Property.  The Applicant did not admit his arrest for Assaulting a Police Officer on August 14, 1994.  (Government Exhibit 2 at Question 26.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Exhibit A shows that, in September 1998, the Applicant went to his local police department and attempted to find out his arrest record information.  
He did this in anticipation of having to fill out a questionnaire.  This form shows the 1993 arrest, which the Applicant admitted.  It did not show the 1994 arrest 
at all.  The Applicant filled out Question 26 in reliance on this form, which he had received from his local police authorities.  (Transcript at 61-63.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant submitted documentation showing that he is a valued, long-standing employee of his company.  (Applicant's Exhibits E and F.)  He is involved 
in his local community.  (Applicant's Exhibit D.)  He is an Honorably discharged veteran.  (Applicant's Exhibit G.)  The Exhibits also show that the Applicant 
is trying hard to better himself educationally, especially in the field of computers.  (Applicant's Exhibit H.)  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy 
factors which must be given "binding" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to 
the pertinent criterion.  However, the factors are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative 
Judge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  
Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human 
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H (Drug involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) any drug abuse;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline G (Alcohol consumption)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related to 
alcohol abuse;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) diagnosis by a credentialed medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(3) positive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline J (Criminal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) Allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) A single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Condition that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(1) the criminal behavior was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline E (Personal conduct)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(2) the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(None of the stated conditions have application in this case.)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, "In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] 
should consider the following factors [General Factors]:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include      knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g. The motivation for the conduct</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence." </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of 
whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours a day.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an Applicant for 
clearance may be involved in drug and alcohol abuse, criminal conduct and falsifying security documents that demonstrates poor judgement, untrustworthiness 
or unreliability on the Applicant's part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense determination based upon consideration and assessment of all available 
information, both favorable and unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and motivation for the individual's 
conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and, 
to the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the future."  The Administrative Judge can only draw those 
inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on 
evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under 
this order...shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the granting of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, 
explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's<EM> </EM>case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that the Applicant has used illegal drugs (Guideline H); that he has a 
history of abusing alcohol (Guideline G); that he has been charged with criminal acts in 1995 (Guideline J); and that he intentionally made false material 
statements to DoD (Guideline E).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant, on the other hand, has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case against him, except in part. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's marijuana use ended less than two years before the record closed.  The Applicant's credible intent not to use marijuana in the future is admirable.  
However, under the particular circumstances of this case, the Applicant has not mitigated this allegation at this time.   Accordingly, Guideline H is found 
against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Turning next to Paragraph 2, concerning the Applicant's alcohol history.  The evidence shows that the Applicant has had a serious alcohol problem in the recent 
past.  By his own admission, the Applicant was an alcoholic or problem drinker up to December 1999.  While he drinks at a lesser rate, the Applicant has not 
stopped his alcohol use.  The Applicant's psychiatrist states that he has been "mostly sober."  After a thorough consideration of the Mitigating Conditions, I find 
that none of them apply to the Applicant at this time.  Guideline G is found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1994, as a result of a manic episode, the Applicant was arrested on successive days.  After the second arrest he was hospitalized and stabilized.  While 
regrettable, the Applicant has always taken responsibility for these incidents, which occurred almost nine years ago.  The Applicant has not had any subsequent 
arrests, and is continuing with psychotherapy and medication in order to avoid recurrence.  Guideline J is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders, and it is a negative factor for security clearance purposes where an 
Applicant has deliberately provided false information about material aspects of his or her personal background.  At the time the Applicant filled out his Security 
Clearance Application, he remembered that alcohol and drug-related incidents had occurred in his past, he knew that he should admit them, and he knowingly 
chose not to do so.  In making this conclusion I have considered the fact that the Applicant was not computer literate and needed help to complete the 
questionnaire.  I have also considered the age of the offenses the Applicant was obligated to admit.  Notwithstanding the fact that they occurred over 20 years 
ago, the Application required that he admit them.  Paragraph 4 and Subparagraph 4.a. are found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subparagraph 4.b. is found for the Applicant as I have determined that the false statement in this subparagraph was not willful.  The Applicant, in good faith, 
used the description given in government records in filling out Question 26 of his Security Clearance Application (Government Exhibit 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant's efforts at reform are noted, and he is commended for his decision to refrain from further drug use and continue to reduce his alcohol use.  
However, under the particular circumstances of this case, this evidence does not overcome the adverse information that has been presented by the Government.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's information opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, 
the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of the Government's Statement of 
Reasons.  As set forth above, Paragraph 3 is found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P>
