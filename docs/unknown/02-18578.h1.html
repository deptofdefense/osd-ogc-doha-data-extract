<P>Sixty-five-year old Applicant's 1958 arrest for larceny in the nighttime, when he was 19 years old, and his subsequent conviction, led to a sentence of 10 years 
imprisonment (suspended) and three years probation.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It has been approximately 45 years since that conviction and sentence.  Since then, he has developed a

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On August 8, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In a sworn, written answer, dated September 2, 2003, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the 
written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the government's written case on October 27, 2003.  A complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM)<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded, until April 9, 2004, an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation.  No further response was made.  The case was assigned to me on April 26, 2004.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has admitted the factual allegation (subparagraph 1.a.) pertaining to criminal conduct under Guideline J.  That admission is incorporated herein as a 
finding of fact.  He has requested a waiver under the remaining allegation.</P> 
 
<P>After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and is seeking to retain a SECRET security clearance which had previously been granted to him in 
June 1978.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was involved in several criminal incidents, some of which occurred approximately 46 years ago.  In October 1957, when he was nearly 18 years old, 
Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of a weapon.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  After spending one night in jail,<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> he was released and eventually fined $15.00.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  In June 
1958, when he was 19 years old, he was arrested and charged with larceny in the nighttime, a felony.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  After spending one night in jail he was released on bail.  
He was eventually convicted and sentenced to serve 10 years in prison, all of which was suspended, and given three years probation.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  One year later, in July 
1959, he was again arrested.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  This time he was charged with disturbing the peace.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  He was eventually convicted and fined.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  At some point between April 
1966 and March 1968, Applicant was arrested on a bench warrant for petty theft.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  The charge was eventually dismissed.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Other than "numerous" traffic-related violations and a 1981 alcohol-related arrest (driving under the influence of alcohol reduced to reckless driving), Applicant has had no other incidents.</P> 
 
<P>He married for the third time in April 1996.<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He received a BSME degree in January 1975.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has been employed by the same company as a mechanical engineer since April 1998.  He had previously been with another federal contractor from 
1986 until 1998, in the same capacity.  The quality of his performance has not been developed in the record.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision in Section E2.2., Enclosure 2, of the 
Directive, are intended to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
administrative judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the  potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Criminal Conduct - Guideline J: A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below<STRONG>.</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 7, 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a Memorandum, <EM>Implementation of Restrictions on the Granting or Renewal of Security Clearances 
as Mandated by the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001</EM>.  The memorandum provides policy guidance for the 
implementation of Section 1071 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, which amended Title 10, United States 
Code, to add a new section (10 U.S.C. &sect; 986) that precludes the initial granting or renewal of a security clearance by the Department of Defense under specific 
circumstances.  The situation described above involves one of those specific circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>The statutory mandate applies to any DoD officer or employee, officer, director, or employee of a DoD contractor, or member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or 
arine Corps on active duty or in an active status, who is under consideration for the issuance or continuation of eligibility for access to classified information 
and who falls under one or more of the following provisions of the statute:</P> 
 
<P>(1) has been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year;</P> 
 
<P>(2) is an unlawful user of, or is addicted to, a controlled substance (as defined in Section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802));</P> 
 
<P>(3) is mentally incompetent, as determined by a mental health professional approved by the Department of Defense; or</P> 
 
<P>(4) has been discharged or dismissed from the Armed Forces under dishonorable conditions.</P> 
 
<P>The statute also "provides that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Military Departments concerned may authorize a waiver of the prohibitions 
concerning convictions, dismissals and dishonorable discharges from the armed forces in meritorious cases."</P> 
 
<P>Implementing guidance attached to the memorandum indicates that provision 1, described above, "disqualifies persons with convictions in both State and 
Federal courts, including UCMJ offenses, with sentences imposed of <EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time actually served."</P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-18578.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest." For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the government must be 
able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><CENTER></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly 
above, I conclude the following with respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government has established its case under Guideline J.  By his own admission, Applicant was involved in criminal behavior in 1958 that resulted in his 
arrest and conviction.  As a result, he was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment (suspended) with three years probation.  Applicant's criminal conduct clearly 
falls within Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) E2.A10.1.2.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>allegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the 
person was formally charged</EM>), CC DC E2.A10.1.2.2. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses</EM>), and CC DC E2.A10.1.2.3. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>conviction in a Federal or 
State court, including a court-martial of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">It has been approximately 45 years since that conviction and sentence.  Since then, he has developed a somewhat spotty record as recently as 1981.  However, 
since 1981, Applicant has not been involved in any additional criminal conduct and has apparently turned his life around and avoided criminal endeavors.  
Those facts would seem to activate Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) E2.A10.1.3.1. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the criminal behavior was not recent</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Moreover, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">by virtue of his spotless record since 1981, and a favorable work history, there is substantial evidence of successful rehabilitation, thus activating CC 
C E2.A10.1.3.6. (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation</EM>).  However, while there was only one </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">significant</SPAN> conviction, Applicant's overall course 
of criminal conduct occurred during 1957-68 (recognizing the charges in 1966-68 were dismissed), I cannot comply with Applicant's desire that I find that it 
was isolated as set forth in CC MC E2.A10.1.3.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">(</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>the crime was an isolated incident</EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past when there is a substantial indication of subsequent reform, remorse, or 
rehabilitation.  Under other circumstances, I would conclude Applicant had, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully mitigated and 
overcome the government's case, and the allegations of the SOR would be concluded in favor of Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">However, Applicant's criminal conduct also falls within 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">He was convicted in a state court of a crime and sentenced to 10 years 
imprisonment--a term which obviously exceeds the one year period envisioned in the law. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Furthermore, as noted above, the implementing guidance attached 
to the memorandum indicates such a sentence would disqualify persons with "sentences imposed of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>more than </EM>one year, regardless of the amount of time 
actually served."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  In this instance, Applicant was fortunate enough to have his prison term reduced rather than actually served, but that fact does not help him in 
this issue.  Consequently, by virtue of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">10 U.S.C. &sect; 986</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for a security clearance.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. and 1.b. of the 
SOR, are concluded against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In this instance, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I do recommend further consideration of this case for a waiver of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is not eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
