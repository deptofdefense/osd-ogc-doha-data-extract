<P>Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies, most of which have now been fully satisfied.  To a large extent his financial problems coincided with the 
break up of his marriage, which has now resulted in a divorce. He also failed to disclose in a Security Clearance Application that he had received punishment 
under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice while on active duty with the United States Army. He has mitigated the security concerns caused by both his 
financial considerations and personal conduct. Clearance is granted.  </P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On June 17, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations and Guideline E for personal conduct.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR on July 16, 2003, and requested a hearing.  Applicant admitted four and denied four of the alleged delinquent 
accounts. He also denied both  personal conduct allegations. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on October 28, 2003. A notice of hearing was issued on November 6, 2003, scheduling the hearing for November 21, 2003.  The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted five documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5 
and admitted into the record without an objection. Applicant testified at the hearing and submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant's 
Exhibits (AE) 1-6, and admitted into the record without an objection. The record was held open to provide Applicant the opportunity to submit additional 
documents in support of his case.  One additional document was timely received, marked as AE 7, and admitted into the record without an objection. The 
transcript was received on December 3, 2003.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government moved to amend the dates alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.b.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, 1.d., 1.f., and 1.g. The motion to amend was granted without an objection.  
The government also moved to amend the amount of the alleged delinquent accounts in subparagraphs 1.d. and 1.f.  Those motions were also granted without 
an objection.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's partial admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 35-years-old and has been employed by a defense contractor since May 2001. He was married in June 1986, obtained a divorce in August 2003, 
and has three children, ages sixteen, fourteen, and thirteen. Applicant provides support for the children who reside with their mother.  He has completed one and 
one-half years of college.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant enlisted in the United States Army on July 1, 1986 and served continuously on active duty until he was honorably discharged on March 31, 2003.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> 
He was a Sergeant, paygrade E-5, at the time of his discharge. He received numerous awards while in the Army, including an Army Commendation Medal, six 
Army Achievement Medals, and four Good Conduct Medals. To the best of his knowledge, Applicant never held a security clearance while in the Army. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant received one non judicial punishment on September 26, 1996, under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), for the offenses of assault 
consummated by a battery and drunk and disorderly. He was awarded 14 days restriction and 14 days extra duty.  The offenses resulted from a physical 
altercation between Applicant and his wife in an on-post club overseas after he found her dancing with another man. Applicant's wife returned to the United 
States following this incident and he completed his overseas assignment unaccompanied, living in a barracks and providing money to his wife to support herself 
and their children.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant accepted employment with a defense contractor in January 2001, and was assigned to an unaccompanied overseas location in the Middle East.  He 
continued to provide support to his wife and children while working in the middle east. Applicant also received more than $35,000.00 in separation pay when 
he was discharged from the Army, which he gave to his wife to pay past due bills and other expenses. He returned to the United States in April 2001, and was 
hired by his present employer in May 2001.     </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant discovered shortly after he returned from the Middle East that his wife had squandered the separation pay on things other than family bills, and that 
she also had neglected a number of other accounts.  They separated a few months after his return and ultimately obtained the divorce in August 2003.  Debts 
were allocated between the parties in the divorce, and Applicant has been satisfying those allocated to him. He also provides more than $1,000.00 per month to 
his wife for alimony and child support payments.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The SOR alleges eight delinquent accounts totaling $5,658.82. A review of the documents submitted by both the government and Applicant discloses that at the 
time of the hearing Applicant had satisfied six of the accounts in full and still owed a total of $877.37 on the remaining two accounts. His financial statement 
discloses, despite the hefty support payments he is making to his ex-wife, he has disposal income to apply to those two remaining debts.      </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on November 7, 2001 in which he answered "No" to question 25: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Your Police Record - Military 
Court - In the last 7 years, have you been subject to court martial or other disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform Code of Military Justice? (Include non-judicial, Captain's mast, etc.). . . .</EM> This answer was incorrect because Applicant did receive Article 15 punishment on September 26, 1996 as discussed earlier. 
Applicant also asserted he had never received non judicial punishment in a statement he provided to a special agent for the Defense Security Service on March 
12, 2001. However, Applicant credibly explained that he thought his company commander had merely "chewed him out" and he was unaware that it had been 
recorded as a non judicial punishment.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F, 
pertaining to financial considerations and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="03-06665.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides 
an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant had more than $5,600.00 in delinquent accounts that were either submitted for collection or written off as bad debts. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A history of not meeting financial obligations </EM>applies in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant credibly explained that most of the accounts resulted from his placing trust in his wife to handle paying accounts while he was either stationed 
overseas with the Army or working in the middle east for a defense contractor. In addition to supplying her with a substantial portion of his pay to satisfy their 
debts, he entrusted her with the relatively large separation pay he received upon being discharged from the Army with the expectation that all his past due 
accounts would be paid. She instead squandered the money for non household expenses, leaving him to satisfy the delinquent accounts with what funds he has 
left after providing her with alimony and support payments.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has made a commendable effort to return to financial responsibility. He presently owes only $877.37 on those accounts listed in the SOR. He has 
sufficient disposable income to satisfy those accounts in the very near future, and his past performance provides adequate justification to believe he will do just 
that. Mitigating Condition (MC) 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts </EM>apply. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Guideline F is decided for Applicant.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant did provide an incorrect answer to a question in the SF 86 he submitted, and erroneous 
information in the course of an interview by a special agent. However, I have considered Applicant's appearance, demeanor, and manner of testifying, and his 
explanation. I am convinced Applicant did not intend to deliberately omit or conceal information.  Guideline E is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
