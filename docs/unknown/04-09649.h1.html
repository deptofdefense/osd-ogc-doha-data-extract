<P>Applicant was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC) and came to the U.S. in 1992 to complete his education.  He, his wife, and their child became U.S. 
citizens in September 2001.  His parents, parents-in-law, and four siblings are citizens and residents of the PRC.  His parents and parents-in-law are retired, and 
one brother owns a small barber shop.  The record contains no other relevant information about his family and in-laws.  The security concern based on foreign 
influence is not mitigated.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 21, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to not grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry </EM>(Feb. 20, 1960), as 
amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Jan. 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), based on Applicant's family ties in the PRC.  
Applicant answered the SOR in writing on July 27, 2005, and elected to have the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Applicant admitted his 
parents, siblings, and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of the PRC (SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c.), denied his father-in-law worked for the PRC jail system 
(&para; 1.d.), admitted sending money to his parents (&para; 1.e.), admitted helping his brother and sister-in-law to establish a barber shop (&para; 1.f.), and admitted traveling 
to the PRC in 2001 to visit family and friends (&para; 1.g.).  Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on August 31, 2005.  A complete copy of 
the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, 
or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on September 28, 2005 and responded on September 30, 2005.  The case was assigned 
to me on November 28, 2005.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the entire record, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 48-year-old engineer for a defense contractor.  He has worked for his current employer since December 2002.  He has never held a security 
clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the PRC.  He was married in April 1992 and completed his undergraduate education in the PRC in May 1992.  He attended graduate 
school in the U.S. from May 1992 until  December 1997, when he received his Ph.D.  He, his wife, and their child became U.S. citizens in September 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents, parents-in-law, and four siblings are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Applicant asserts they are not his "immediate family" and his 
contact with them is "casual."  Since he came to the U.S., he has visited his family in the PRC once, staying for about 21 days in 2001.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant sends his parents $600 once or twice a year on special occasions, as a sign of filial piety.  In the Chinese culture, the numeral "6" signifies long life 
and health.  His parents are both 80 years old.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2004, Applicant's brother  became unemployed.  Applicant gave him and his wife $800 to start a small barber shop.  Applicant has no financial interest in the 
barber shop.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant denies the allegation his father-in-law worked in the PRC jail system.  He states his father-in-law worked in a machinery shop that was attached to a 
jail.  There is no evidence his father-in-law was connected with the PRC penal system.  His father-in-law is now 83 years old and has been retired for nearly 30 
years.  The machinery shop no longer exists.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is a Communist state.  The Chinese Communist Party is authoritarian in structure and ideology and dominates the government.  Party committees 
work in all important government, economic, and cultural institutions to ensure party policy guidance is followed and non-party members do not create 
organizations that could challenge party rule.  The U.S. State Department has documented numerous instances of human rights abuses stemming from the 
government's intolerance of dissent and the inadequacy of legal safeguards for basic freedoms.<A HREF="04-09649.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC and the U.S. are major trading partners.<A HREF="04-09649.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2002, the PRC became an important partner in U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.  The PRC and the U.S. have worked closely on regional issues, especially those involving North Korea.  However, U.S.-PRC relations are 
sometimes complicated by events in Taiwan and Hong Kong.<A HREF="04-09649.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The PRC is one of the most active collectors of U.S. defense information and technology.<A HREF="04-09649.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the 
applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified information, and it lists the disqualifying conditions (DC) and 
mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline.  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material 
facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive &para;&para; 6.3.1 through 6.3.6.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">In evaluating an applicant's conduct, an administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant's age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Directive &para;&para; E2.2.1.1 through 
E2.2.1.9.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is 
merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant's security suitability."  ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. 
Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."  <EM>Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531; <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not 
citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.  A disqualifying condition (DC 1) may arise when "[a]n immediate family member [spouse, father, mother, sons, 
daughters, brothers, sisters], or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  Although Applicant denies his father, mother, and siblings are "immediate family," they fall within the Directive's 
definition of immediate family.  Accordingly, I conclude DC 1 is established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">disqualifying condition (DC 2) also may arise if an applicant is "[s]haring living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the 
potential for adverse foreign influence or duress exists."  I conclude DC 2 is established because the parents of Applicant's spouse are citizens and residents of 
the PRC.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, a disqualifying condition (DC 3) may arise if an individual has relatives "who are connected with any foreign government."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.2.3.  
Although the SOR &para; 1.d. alleges Applicant worked for the PRC jail system, Applicant denies the allegation and asserts his father-in-law worked in a machinery 
shop that was attached to a jailhouse and has been retired for 25-30 years.  The government has presented no evidence to contradict Applicant's assertion.  
There is no evidence in the FORM showing Applicant's father-in-law was an employee of the PRC penal system.  I conclude Applicant has refuted the 
allegation in the SOR &para; 1.d.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Since the Government  produced substantial evidence to establish DC 1, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate the facts.  Directive &para; E3.1.15.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In cases where an Applicant has immediate family members who are citizens or residents of a foreign country or who 
are connected with a foreign government, a mitigating condition (MC 1) may apply if "the immediate family members, cohabitant, or associate(s) in question 
are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the 
person(s) involved and the United States."  Directive &para; E2A2.1.3.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Notwithstanding the facially disjunctive language of MC 1("agents of a foreign power <STRONG>or</STRONG> in a position to be exploited"), it requires proof "that an applicant's 
family members, cohabitant, or associates in question are (a) not agents of a foreign power, <STRONG>and</STRONG> (b) not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way 
that could force the applicant to chose between the person(s) involved and the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-14995 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2004); <EM>see</EM> 50 
U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b) (defining "agent of a foreign power"). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  "The United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified 
information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has 
interests inimical to those of the United States."  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly 
governments must be made with caution.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national 
security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <EM>See</EM> 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation's government, its relationship with 
the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant's family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The 
risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or 
dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has presented evidence his parents and parents-in-law are elderly and retired.  He also has presented evidence his brother owns a small barber shop.  
The record does not indicate whether his sister-in-law is involved with the barber shop or is otherwise employed.  He has presented no evidence regarding his 
other siblings, and no evidence concerning the political, economic, or social ties of his family or their dependence, if any, on the PRC government for medical 
or financial benefits.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR 
Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of establishing MC 1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A mitigating condition (MC 3) may apply if "[c]ontact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and infrequent."  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.3.3.  
Applicant asserts the contacts with his immediate family are "casual."  However, there is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family 
member in a foreign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  Contact is casual when it is unintended or occurs as an 
incidental byproduct of other activities, such as attending a party where a foreign citizen also has been invited.  Contact may not be casual if an applicant took 
the initiative to make it happen.  The record reflects that Applicant's $600 gifts once or twice a year are acts of filial piety, not incidental or unintended contacts.  
Similarly, the gift of $800 to his brother to establish a barber shop goes beyond an incidental or unintended contact.  I conclude MC 3 is not established.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse."  ISCR Case 
No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002).  Other than asserting in conclusory terms that his in-laws are not immediate family and 
contacts are "casual," Applicant has presented no evidence of the frequency or nature of his contacts with his in-laws.  Thus, he has not rebutted the 
presumption.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None of the individual family circumstances discussed above are determinative.  The totality of Applicant's family ties to a foreign country as well as each 
individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  After considering the disqualifying conditions established 
by the record and the absence of mitigating conditions, and evaluating the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated 
the security concern based on foreign influence.</SPAN></P>
