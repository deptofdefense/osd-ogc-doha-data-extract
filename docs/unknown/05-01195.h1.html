<P>Applicant's wife is a citizen of Thailand. They have been married for 20 years, and she is a permanent resident of the United States. His wife has regular contact 
with her family members living in Thailand. Applicant does not. His wife owns a house in Thailand, from which she receives no income. This house has

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>On August 19, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On September 
12, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations, and requested a hearing. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>This matter was assigned to me on November 21, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on  November 22, 2005, and a hearing was held on December 15, 2005. 
Three government exhibits were admitted into evidence. In addition, the government offered one document and Applicant offered eleven documents for me to 
take notice of their contents. Applicant and one witness testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on January 9, 2006.<BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. In addition, each security clearance 
decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the factors listed in the Directive. 
Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of 
the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_76_"><SUP> (76)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_77_"><SUP> (77)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_78_"><SUP> (78)</SUP></A>Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome 
the case against him.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_79_"><SUP> (79)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_80_"><SUP> (80)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_81_"><SUP> (81)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_82_"><SUP> (82)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_83_"><SUP> (83)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_84_"><SUP> (84)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Foreign Influence - Guideline B: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom 
he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could 
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or 
financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, 
exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline B. Based on all the evidence, Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (An 
immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign 
country) applies in this case. Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, and 
sisters. Applicant's wife is a citizen of Thailand. This "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified 
information."<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_85_"><SUP> (85)</SUP></A> The mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_86_"><SUP> (86)</SUP></A> However, 
such ties do raise a prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the 
applicant's burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_87_"><SUP> (87)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Although the definition of family member in Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1 does not include in-laws, the Appeal Board has opined that it includes a rebuttable 
presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.<A HREF="05-01195.h1.html#N_88_"><SUP> (88)</SUP></A> Applicant's father-in-law and 
mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Thailand. In addition, his wife has close ties with her uncle and siblings, who are citizens and residents of Thailand.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>I considered the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) and conclude that FI MC E2.A2.1.3.1. (A determination that the immediate family 
member(s), (spouse, father mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to 
be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States) applies. 
Applicant's wife is a long-time U.S. resident and has expressed an intent to complete the naturalization process. She is not an agent or employee of the Thai 
government or military. In an effort to share her U.S. educational experience with other Thai students, as a representative of a U.S. university, she developed a 
working relationship with a Thai consulate in the U.S. to recruit students for the school. Rather than making her an agent of a foreign power, her recruiting 
efforts reflect her loyalty and commitment to the U.S. She has not recruited students recently. This past work has not put her in a position to be exploited in a 
way that could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to his family and the United States. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has no immediate family members living outside the United States. His closest family members are his wife and son, who live with him. Because 
these family members are in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion or exploitation. Although his wife travels to Thailand once a year to visit 
family, Thailand's close ties to the U.S. make it highly unlikely that she will be vulnerable to coercion or exploitation. Thailand and the U.S. share intelligence 
and work together on military operations. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's father-in-law is a wealthy business owner who is not financially dependent on him. His father-in-law continues to operate his private business. He is 
not an agent of a foreign power. He is free to travel to the U.S. and does so without recrimination from the Thai government. His mother-in-law does receive 
some financial support from Applicant and his wife, as she does not work and lives separately from his father-in-law. Her other children also contribute to her 
support. She is not an agent of a foreign power.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife has significant contact with her immediate family in Thailand. He, on the other hand, has very limited contact. He does not travel regularly to 
Thailand to visit his in-laws nor does he have regular contact with them. With the exception of one sister-in-law, he does not talk or write to his in-laws, as he 
does not speak or write Thai and his in-laws do not speak or write English. He, however, has ties of affection and a sense of obligation to his mother-in-law as 
shown by his willingness to provided her with financial support. Given the long-term friendship between the U.S. and Thailand, as well as their ongoing 
cooperative efforts in law enforcement, intelligence, terrorism, and military operations, it is highly unlikely that Thailand would pressure his wife or in-laws to 
obtain classified information from him or force him to choose between his family and the U.S.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife owns a house in Thailand, which is titled in her name. Her mother lives in this house, which has an estimated value of between $70,000 and 
$80,000. Thus, DC FI E2.A2.1.2.8. (A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual 
vulnerable to foreign influence) applies. Applicant has mitigated this concern under MC FI E2.A2.1.3.5. (Foreign financial interests are minimal and not 
sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities). He and his wife own real estate in the U.S. valued at $1,000,000 gross. He holds a 50% interest in a 
real estate partnership, which he estimates to be worth between $2,000,000 and $2,500,000 gross. He estimates his net worth on these investments to be 
$1,500,000. In addition, he has retirement funds and other financial assets plus his monthly income. His U.S. assets far exceed the value of the house in 
Thailand. This house has no impact on his overall financial condition, and would have no affect on his security responsibility.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Finally, I have considered the "whole person" concept in evaluating Applicant's risk and vulnerability in protecting our national interests. I am persuaded by the 
evidence that Applicant would not be vulnerable to pressure or duress from a foreign power or the government of Thailand. Applicant's in-laws lack the 
knowledge and expertise to understand the work he performs. They are not in a position to provide any useful information about his work to a foreign power. 
Thailand's relationship with the U.S. on matters of law enforcement, intelligence, terrorism, and military operations, in particular, significantly decreases the 
likelihood of governmental pressure on his wife or her family in Thailand. His supervisor credibly testified to Applicant's careful and proper handling sensitive 
information at all times. There is little chance that he would be subject to influence, coercion or duress from the government of Thailand. Applicant has 
mitigated the government's case under Guideline B. Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a 
security clearance to Applicant.<BR>
