incorporate his admissions as findings of fact. He is </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">a 28-year-old facility security officer </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">employed by a defense contractor since January 2003. He previously held a clearance while in the military 
between 1995 and 2000.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In March 2000, while serving with U.S. Forces in Europe, Applicant was investigated on allegations of child abuse when workers at the military day-care center that Applicant's son attended 
reported suspicious wounds over the boy's body consistent with being beaten with a belt or similar object. Subsequent investigation established that on at least two occasions Applicant repeatedly 
struck his then-four-year-old son with a belt, resulting in several contusions, abrasions, bruises, and minor lacerations to the boy's lower torso, right thigh, lower right abdomen, groin area, and 
scalp. Applicant was charged with assault on a child under the age of 16 years under Article 128, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), and referred to a summary court-martial (SCM)<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in 
July 2000, where he was found guilty, sentenced to confinement at hard labor (CHL) for 30 days,<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> and ordered to attend parenting and anger management classes (G.E. 6, 7).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">During investigation of the alleged assaults on his son in 2000, Applicant admitted--and continues to admit--that he repeatedly beat his son with a belt because of the boy's shortcomings in being 
potty trained. Applicant attributed his conduct to the long hours he served as a military policeman, coupled with trying to be a good single parent. Although he admits that he appeared at summary 
court-martial, received 30 days CHL,<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> and was ordered to attend parenting and anger management classes, he insists that he was found "not guilty" of the assault charges by the presiding officer. 
This is factually inconsistent with the report of disciplinary action (G.E. 6), and legally impossible under the UCMJ, as he could not have been sentenced to CHL without a guilty finding on the 
assault charge, or some lesser included offense.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">When Applicant applied for an industrial clearance in February 2002 (G.E. 1), he answered "no" to a question requiring him to disclose any court-martial or disciplinary action under the UCMJ 
within the last seven years (question 25). He also failed to disclose his son in response to a question requiring him to disclose his relatives and associates (question 9), although he listed nine other 
required relatives. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant asserts that he simply forgot to list his children (he also failed to list a daughter). He gives varying explanations for his failure to list his July 2000 SCM. Sometimes he suggests that he 
was told by his facility security officer (FSO) not to list the SCM. In other places he suggests that he told his FSO about the assault charges, and the FSO--who was entering Applicant's 
information into the electronic clearance application--made the decision to leave the SCM off the application. Undisputed is the fact that Applicant signed the clearance application, knowing he had 
been referred to SCM, regardless of formal finding, and punished.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant did not volunteer any information about his SCM in a September 2003 sworn statement (G.E. 2) whose subject matter involved only his current financial situation. However, he 
misrepresented the circumstances of the SCM in a March 2004 sworn statement (G.E. 3), when he stated : "the U.S. Army had me down with a charge of assault. The charges were never brought 
against me. I was never court-martialed or received any Article 15. . . Reason I believe I received unfavorable action, GSA Criminal Investigation Office has misleading information that pertains to 
me that is incorrect." He has admitted that this statement was false. He did not disclose a more accurate version of his SCM until he was confronted with the report of disciplinary action (G.E. 6) 
and responded in a February 2005 sworn statement (G.E. 4). As with his false clearance application, Applicant has given varying explanations why he falsified his March 2004 sworn statement. 
Sometimes he claims that his FSO told him that he did not have to discuss anything that was not on his clearance application. Elsewhere, he acknowledges that he was not truthful because he 
realized he should not make a statement that was inconsistent with his clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has a history of financial difficulties as reflected in credit reports dated March 2003 (five collection/charge off, one lien/judgment, one slow pay)(G.E. 8), August 2005 (four collection/ 
charge off, two judgments, one slow pay)(G.E. 9),<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> and January 2006 (the accounts previously reported, plus additional collection accounts not alleged in the SOR)(A.E. C).<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Based on the August 
2005 credit report, the SOR alleged six delinquent accounts totaling over $7,300, falling past due between January 1999 and December 2004. Applicant admitted two debts (SOR 1.c. and 1.e.) 
totaling approximately $1,600. He claimed sporadic payments on the debt at 1.c. (supported by A.E. C), but acknowledged at hearing that he was not making regular payments on the account, and 
had no payment plan with the creditor. Of the five debts Applicant denied (SOR 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.f.), he claimed to have paid two (SOR 1.a. and 1.f.), but provided no corroboration of that claim. 
Regarding SOR 1.d., he provided corroboration of his answer that the account had been reduced to $35.00 by October 2005, and paid in January 2006 (A.E. E). Regarding SOR 1.b., Applicant did 
not recognize the creditor in the allegation, but the record reflects that the creditor listed is the successor-in-interest for the debt that  Applicant reported on his clearance application (as past due 
since 1997), reduced to judgment, and morphed through several different collection agents until Applicant provided proof at hearing that the account had been settled and paid in January 2006 (A.E. 
D).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to the high cost of living in the area where he is employed, but otherwise cites no particular circumstances contributing to his difficulties. He says he has 
"something" of a budget.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's character ref</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">erences (AE A, B) consider him a trustworthy employee</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and an involved parent.

consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classif</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">ied information.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The government must prove, by something less 
than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, 
extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" 
standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the government.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a case for disqualification under Guideline J disqualifying conditions 1 and 2,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. His physical abuse of his four-year-old son, while not recent or repeated, represents an egregious breach of his most fundamental obligation to his child, and raises serious questions on his judgment and reliability. Further, his 
insistence that he was not found guilty at his SCM in 2000 suggests that he does not fully accept responsibility for his conduct. In addition, he deliberately concealed this court-martial from the 
government on his February 2003 clearance application, and misrepresented the circumstances of that court-martial on his May 2004 sworn statement in violation of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">18 U.S.C. &sect;1001.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I resolve 
Guideline J against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government also established a case for disqualification under Guideline E case under disqualifying conditions 2 and 3,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant 
provided false answers on his clearance application and misleading information on his May 2004 sworn statement. Ordinarily, I might consider the omission of a child from a clearance application 
to be neither relevant or material. However, I conclude otherwise here, because the child Applicant omitted was the victim of the assaults that lead to the court-martial that Applicant sought to 
conceal. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's falsifications and misrepresentations demonstrate a lack of candor required of cleared personnel and suggest he is willing to put his personal needs ahead of legitimate government 
interests. The government has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an applicant before making a clearance decision, and relies on applicants to truthfully 
disclose that adverse information. Further, an applicant's willingness to report adverse information about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report inadvertent security violations 
or other security concerns in the future, something the government relies on in order to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of classified information. I resolve Guideline E 
against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Finally, the government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F disqualifying conditions 1 and 3,<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>and Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has delinquent 
accounts going as far back as 1997. He articulates no reason, except cost of living, that his problems might be considered beyond his control.<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although he has paid some of his delinquent debts 
over the years, he continues to accrue new delinquencies. One of the debts he satisfied on the eve of the hearing was the debt that had been past due since 1997. Applicant's failure to respond in a 
systematic and timely matter to his past due debts does not demonstrate good faith in addressing his debts.<A HREF="05-02033.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
