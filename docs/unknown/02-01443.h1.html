<P>Applicant, a 53-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in mainland China, has lived here since 1990. His elderly, retired parents still live in China, his 
children are naturalized U.S. citizens, and his son-in-law is a permanent resident alien. Applicant's wife has been unable to pass the language requirement for 
naturalization, but will remain in the U.S. as a permanent resident alien. Applicant's foreign contacts are casual and infrequent, and not in a position to be 
coerced or pressured by the Chinese government. Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On January 2, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (SOR) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security 
concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOHA 
adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On January 17, 2003, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on February 28, 2003. On March 11, 2003, 
DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting this case to be heard on April 1, 2003. All parties appeared as scheduled and the Government presented five exhibits 
(GE 1 through 5), of which GE 1 and GE 2 were admitted as evidence without objection. I granted Department Counsel's request that I take administrative 
notice of the information contained in GE 3 through GE 5, for identification only.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant presented one exhibit (AE A), which was admitted without 
objection. Applicant also testified in his own behalf and presented three other witnesses. DOHA received the transcript (Tr) on April 16, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted four documents with his Answer, which would normally be submitted as exhibits in his case-in-chief subject to objection or comment by 
Department Counsel. Rather than sever the documents and ask Applicant to re-submit them, I determined that Department Counsel had no objection to my 
considering the documents as evidence. Therefore, I have considered the documents attached to the Answer as AE B, C, D, and E.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted with explanation the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, however, he denies the allegations in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d. 
Additionally,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> after a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was born in mainland China in 1947 in Chengdu province, which is about 1,300 miles southwest of Beijing.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> At age 18, he left home to study at a 
university in Beijing. Between 1965 and 1990, when he moved to the United States, he visited his parents six times. His parents, now in their 80's, are a retired 
college professor and accountant, living on pensions in Chengdu. Applicant sends them between $500.00 and $1,000.00 each year to supplement their 
retirement income. Applicant's wife of nearly 30 years was also born in mainland China. The couple has two grown children, both born in China.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant expertise is computer science, which he studied and has taught at Chinese and American universities. In 1984, Applicant came to a U.S. university as 
a visiting scholar in the field of computer science for two years. During that time, he also worked at a start-up information technology firm, and spent time at 
another university before returning to China in 1986. While in the U.S., he worked with and became friends with other Chinese citizens who were here for the 
same reasons. They returned to China in 1986, and Applicant still has casual contact with two or three of them once or twice yearly by e-mail.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant returned to China in 1986, but knew then he wanted his family to live in the United States. He came to the U.S. alone in 1990 to find work. His wife 
and daughter followed in 1992, and his son arrived in 1993. All four became permanent resident aliens as soon as possible, and, except for Applicant's wife, all 
are now naturalized U.S. citizens (Applicant became a citizen in August 1999). Applicant's wife has been unable to pass the language requirement, but 
continues to take English language classes and will try again to pass the test. Alternatively, she intends to remain here with her family as a permanent resident 
alien because her family is here, and she would not receive the various retirement benefits she and Applicant have accrued since moving to the U.S.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has returned to China four times since 1990. In 1997, he and his wife visited her sister who was gravely ill. His sister-in-law eventually died the next 
year. In 1999, Applicant's parents and his wife's parents decided to visit the U.S. as a way of getting over the loss of Applicant's sister-in-law. Because of their 
advanced age, Applicant traveled to China to escort them to the U.S. where they visited for six months. Applicant returned to China in July 2000 for three 
weeks to see his parents after his father suffered a cerebral hemorrhage. After he was hired by his current employer in February 2001, Applicant made an 
additional trip to China, again to visit his parents.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Since arriving in the United States in 1990, Applicant has worked as a software engineer for several different private companies. Only his current employer is 
associated with DoD and may require Applicant to report overseas travel. His employer is aware that he traveled to China in 2002, and he has used his U.S. 
passport only for all of his travel since naturalization. A previously held Chinese passport expired in December 1999, four months after he was naturalized.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's son-in-law is a Chinese citizen, but is also permanent resident alien as of April 2002 (he applied for this status in April 2001). He came to the U.S. 
on a student visa in 1995 and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> graduated from a major U.S. university in 1999. He was previously married from 1995 to 1997. Since marrying Applicant's daughter, he has continued to live 
and work in the United States, and the couple has a child, born in the United States in 2001. He has returned to China only once, and his parents visited in 2001 
to see their new grandchild. He has irregular contact with his parents and little or no contact with his siblings. None of his family is employed by or has any 
association with the Chinese government. He intends to apply for citizenship when he is eligible in 2005.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's employer is very happy with his work and regards Applicant as a reliable and trustworthy person.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> I found Applicant and his witnesses sincere and 
earnest in their testimony.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, specifically, that Applicant has close ties of affection who are foreign citizens, I 
conclude the relevant adjudicative guideline to be applied here is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden it establishes a </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest for the Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's 
case. Because no one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> A person who has access to classified 
information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, therefore, has a compelling interest in 
ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The 
"clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability for access in favor of the 
Government.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline B (Foreign Influence). </STRONG>A</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she 
may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential 
for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other 
countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Government has established its case under Guideline B by showing that Applicant has close ties of affection who are foreign citizens and/or living in a 
foreign country. As alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, Applicant's parents, wife, and son-in-law are Chinese citizens. His parents still live in 
China, but his wife and son-in-law live with or near Applicant in the U.S. The allegations in subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d that Applicant's children are Chinese 
citizens may have been true based on the background investigation. However, both have since been naturalized as U.S. citizens. Both persons took the Oath of 
Allegiance renouncing their foreign citizenship and there is no information available to show they done anything since naturalization to maintain or regain any 
rights or privileges available as Chinese citizens. I must conclude, therefore, that they, like their father, are no longer Chinese citizens. On these facts, Guideline 
B Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> 
<P> applies.</P> 
 
<P>Any analysis under Guideline B must consider the nature and circumstances of the country involved. China, an authoritarian Communist regime, has an 
abysmal record of human rights abuses of its citizenry. Further, China is considered one of the more active countries when it comes to espionage activities in 
the United States. However, China has also been trying to transform its economy to more of a free enterprise system. A key to this effort has been to gain entry 
to global markets (particularly the U.S.) in exchange for increased cooperation with the west and reforms in its internal affairs. Nonetheless, China's internal 
practices as well as its interests as an emerging superpower are often at odds with the United States' national interests. Therefore, any contacts in China by 
persons with access to classified information warrant more scrutiny than contacts with countries whose interests and forms of government are more closely 
aligned with ours.</P> 
 
<P>The dispositive issue is whether, in light of the foregoing, Applicant's parents, wife or son-in-law are vulnerable to coercion by the Chinese government for 
purposes of compromising U.S. national interests through the Applicant. While the possibility of coercion must be acknowledged solely because his parents live 
in China and he has other foreign ties of affection, the likelihood of this happening appears to be so remote that it does not pose an unacceptable risk in the 
context of determining Applicant's suitability for a clearance. They are elderly pensioners, one of whom has health problems. They retired from non-governmental positions and continue to live in a province far-removed from the central government in Beijing.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's son-in-law, while still a Chinese citizen, has lived in the United States for seven-and-a-half years. He now has permanent resident alien status after 
having lived here as a student, and  has established significant U.S. ties through his marriage, the birth of a U.S.-born child, completion of his education at a 
U.S. college and an apparently successful career as a software engineer. He has little contact with his family overseas and has seen them twice since 1995. 
Applicant's wife would be a U.S. citizen now were it not for her difficulty learning English. Her contacts with her parents are limited and she has been back to 
China once since 1990, when she visited her ailing sister in 1997. Applicant's children are U.S. citizens and have little or no contact with their parents' relatives 
or, in the case of Applicant's daughter, their in-laws in China. None of Applicant's relatives is or ever has been associated with the Chinese government, and 
they have not been contacted by anyone purporting to represent the Chinese government or trying to obtain information about Applicant's work. Applicant's 
wife is a housewife with permanent resident alien status and no desire to return to China. She has infrequent contact with her parents and other relatives in 
China, and is still trying to pass the language requirement so she can become a U.S. citizen. Her parents are also elderly and retired from non-governmental 
careers. Guideline B DC 1<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 3<A HREF="02-01443.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply. </P> 
 
<P>I have carefully weighed all of the evidence in this case, and I have applied the aforementioned disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each 
applicable adjudicative guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair 
and commonsense assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. Despite concerns the nature and practices of the Chinese 
government, I am convinced that Applicant's foreign connections do not pose a security risk. I conclude Guideline B for the Applicant.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Formal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are as follows:</P>
