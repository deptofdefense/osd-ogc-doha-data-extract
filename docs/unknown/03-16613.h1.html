<P>Applicant's marital separation and divorce, coupled with several periods of unemployment, resulted in numerous delinquent debts.  Applicant began paying his 
delinquent debts before the initiation of this action, has paid or resolved many of the outstanding obligations, and is repaying the remaining accounts.  In about 
2000, Applicant violated company policy by failing to pay his corporate credit card account when due, but that was an isolated event several years ago.  
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial difficulties and personal conduct.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On June 12, 2001, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or 
continue a security clearance for Applicant under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> 
(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (the "Directive").  On November 16, 2005, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated February 16, 2005, detailing the 
basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under the Directive, Guideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on December 15, 2005.  He elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.</P> 
<P>I received the case assignment on March 29, 2006.  With the concurrence of Applicant and Department Counsel, I convened the hearing on April 20, 2006.  The 
government introduced Exhibits 1 through 5.  Applicant presented Exhibits A through Z and testified on his own behalf.  At Applicant's request, I kept the 
record open until May 22, 2006, to allow Applicant time to submit additional matters.  On May 19, 2006, Applicant provided documents admitted as Exhibits 
AA, BB, and CC, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 3, 2006. </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant denied the allegations in &para;&para; 1.g, 1.q, 1.r, and 1.s of the SOR, but admitted the remaining allegations.  (Applicant's Answer to SOR, dated December 
15, 2005.)  Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the 
following additional findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant was born in December 1970.  (Ex. 1 at 1.)  After high school he attended a technical college.  (Tr. at 18.) </P> 
<P>Applicant began working as an electronics technician for a defense contractor in July 1991.  His duties involved installing electronic systems aboard ships.  (Ex. 
1 at 3; Tr. at 18.)  </P> 
<P>He was married in March 1995.  (Ex. 1 at 3.)  One child was born of the marriage.  (Tr. At 46.)  During the marriage, Applicant and his wife accumulated 
substantial consumer debt.  (Ex. 2 at 2.)  In December 1996, Applicant and his wife filed jointly for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code.  (Ex. 
3 at 2; Ex. 2 at 2.)  They arranged for the regular bankruptcy payment to be paid from his wife's funds.  (Tr. at 59.)  Applicant separated from his wife in 
January 1997.  (Ex. 1 at 3.)  While living separately, they did not make the necessary payments under the Chapter 13 repayment plan, and the bankruptcy was 
dismissed.  (Tr. at 59; Ex. 2 at 2; Ex. 3 at 4.)  According to Applicant, his wife was supposed to make the required payment to the bankruptcy trustee, but did 
not do so.  (Tr. at 59.)</P> 
<P>After Applicant separated from his wife, he made regular child support payments.  Later, a dispute developed over the appropriate amount and she brought suit.  
The court ordered Applicant to pay $580.00 each month.  The court also ordered Applicant to pay $125.00 per month to make up for previous months.  (Tr. at 
47.) </P> 
<P>Applicant worked for his first employer until May 1997, when the company lost the contract.  (Ex. 1 at 3; Tr. at 49.)  He then worked as an assembler for 
another federal contractor from about June 1997 until May 1998.  (Ex. 1 at 2.)</P> 
<P>Applicant was unemployed from May through October 1998.  (Ex. 1 at 2.)  Because of the debts incurred during his marriage, the additional delinquencies that 
arose during his unemployment, and the court-ordered child support payments, Applicant fell behind on his payments on several debts.  (Tr. at 49-50.)  </P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>In about October 1998, Applicant resumed working for a federal contractor as an electronics technician.  (Ex. 1 at 2.)  While Applicant was working for his 
employer overseas, creditors repossessed his automobile.  (Ex. 1 at 7; Tr. at 57-58.)  The creditor asserted a claim for amounts unpaid under the purchase 
agreement.  (SOR, &para; 1.m; Ex. 5 at 3.)  </P> 
<P>Since then, he has worked for a series of defense contractors, but the work was sporadic.  Applicant was unemployed for two weeks in May 2004, and from 
August 2004 through March 2005.  (Ex. Y.)  Although Applicant received unemployment compensation benefits, they were not sufficient to stay current on his 
financial obligations.  (Ex. Y; Tr. at 48.)  During periods of unemployment, Applicant made partial payments toward his court-ordered child support obligation, 
but a deficiency accumulated.  (Tr. at 48; Ex. Z.)  While unemployed, he moved out of his apartment, but was unable to pay the last month's rent and fees 
arising from cleaning the residence.  (Tr. at 51.)  The landlord obtained a judgment against Applicant for the claimed amount.</P> 
<P>In about 2000 Applicant's employer provided a credit card for him to use for business expenses only.  (Tr. at 49.)  Applicant used the credit card properly and 
was reimbursed by his company for the expenditures.  However, Applicant did not use the reimbursement to pay off the corporate credit card account-rather, he 
used the funds for personal debts.  (Tr. at 50-51.)   <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P>In about 2001, while working for his employer at a site out of state, Applicant fell ill and sought medical treatment.  (Tr. at 56-57.)  He later received notice of 
two separate bills for his treatment.  (Tr. at 57.)  Believing he was covered by the company insurance, Applicant did not pay the bills.  (Tr. at 56.)  Later, the 
insurance company denied coverage, and Applicant satisfied the accounts.</P> 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Before the initiation of this action, Applicant began negotiating settlements for outstanding debts and paying off delinquent accounts.  He prepared a formal 
plan to pay off his delinquent debts.  (Ex. X.)  He paid a judgment in the amount of $680.00 and admits one other judgment is outstanding.  (Tr. at 53.)  He 
challenges the credit report entry relating to another judgment.  (Tr. at 52.)  He attempted to contact the attorneys representing the landlord concerning the 
outstanding judgment, but obtained no information.  (Tr. at 52.)  He also inquired about the amount claimed by the creditor following the repossession of his 
automobile.  The creditor responded in writing indicating it had no open account for Applicant.  (Ex. AA.)  Applicant challenged that entry on his credit report 
and it was removed.  (Tr. at 61.)</P>

</P> 
<P>Applicant has remarried.  (Tr. at 18.)  Other than the debts that arose during his unemployment, he is current on his financial obligations.  (Ex. W.)  He operates 
a side business installing satellite television systems and communications equipment.  (Tr. at 70.)  He has been making his court-ordered child support 
payments of $580.00 per month, along with additional monthly payments of $245.00 or more against the arrearage.  (Ex. Y.)  His landlord wrote that Applicant 
is a responsible tenant who pays his rent on time.  (Ex. V at 3.)  In addition to his efforts at resolving the debts listed in the SOR, Applicant has established a 
solid financial record with other creditors, including suppliers for his side business.<STRONG>  </STRONG>(Ex. V at 4.) <STRONG></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The President has "the authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently 
trustworthy to occupy a position &hellip; that will give that person access to such information."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">(<EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).)  In 
Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM> (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding 
classified information within the executive branch. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.1.)  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> </EM>(<EM>Id.</EM>)  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the 
conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent 
behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  (<EM>Id.</EM>) <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  (Directive, &para; E3.1.15.)  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or 
continue his security clearance."  (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).)  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly 
consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  (Directive, &para; E2.2.2.) </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree 
of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President has established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F, Financial Considerations</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The security concern under Guideline</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> F, Financial Considerations, is that "An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal 
acts to generate funds."  (Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.)  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate 
security concerns under this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A6.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be disqualifying if the evidence reveals "[a] history of not meeting financial obligations."  
Similarly, under &para; E2.A6.1.2.3, an "[i]nability or unwillingness to satisfy debts" may be disqualifying.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant failed to meet some significant financial 
obligations between about 1999 and 2005.  He is unable to pay all his delinquent debts in full at this time, although he is making payments.  I conclude the 
available evidence raises these potentially disqualifying conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security concerns arising from an applicant's financial difficulties can be mitigated.  Under the Directive, &para; E2.A6.1.3.1, it may be mitigating where "the 
behavior was not recent."  The behavior in question is his failure to pay or otherwise resolve the delinquent debts.  While Applicant paid several of the debts 
before the initiation of this action, some remain unpaid.  I find this potentially mitigating condition applies in part.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A6.1.3.2 of the Directive provides that it may be mitigating where the financial difficulty "was an isolated incident."  Applicant had several 
delinquent debts that arose at different times; therefore, this was not an isolated incident.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not a factor here.<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A6.1.3.3, it may be mitigating where, "[t]he conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Applicant's financial problems arose as a result of 
conditions largely beyond his control.  First, the marital separation that eventually led to divorce resulted in financial strain and, ultimately to the dismissal of 
his bankruptcy plan.  Secondly, his extended periods of unemployment caused the greatest bulk of his financial problems.  I conclude this mitigating condition 
must be considered in this case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Proof that "[t]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control," may be mitigating under &para; E2.A6.1.3.4 of the Directive.  Applicant did not present evidence that he sought or received financial counseling, therefore 
this mitigating condition is not raised.<STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A6.1.3.6 of the Directive states it may be mitigating where, "[t]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts."  Applicant began paying his bills before the initiation of this action.  He provided documentary evidence that he paid 10 of the 19 debts listed in 
the SOR.  He is making payments against six other delinquent accounts.  The creditor for the largest outstanding debt (SOR, &para; 1.m) affirmatively indicated they 
have no open account for him.  Finally, he is investigating the status of the remaining open accounts to determine their status to resolve them.  I recognize that 
Applicant must work within his financial means to resolve his delinquent debts, and I find Applicant has acted reasonably under all the circumstances.  I 
conclude this potentially mitigating condition applies. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The security concern under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, is that "Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information."  
(Directive, &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under the Directive, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">&para; E2.A5.1.2.1, "[r]eliable, unfavorable information provided by associates, employers, coworkers, neighbors, and other acquaintances" that 
involves questionable judgment, or unwillingness to comply with rules or regulations, could be disqualifying.  The SOR alleges Applicant violated an 
employer's company policy</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> by using a company credit card to pay personal expenses.  The evidence revealed slightly different facts; Applicant used the credit 
card properly, but did not pay the bill in a timely manner.  This evidence is some indication Applicant did not comply with company rules.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, &para; E2.A5.1.2.5 provides that "[a] pattern of dishonesty or rule violations," may be disqualifying.  The evidence indicates only one instance where 
Applicant did not properly handle his corporate credit card account; thus, there is no indication of a pattern of conduct.  The evidence does not raise this 
potentially disqualifying condition.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive sets out several potentially mitigating conditions; however, most are directed toward conduct involving falsification, which is not present here.  
The available evidence does not raise any of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>The "Whole Person" Concept</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I note Applicant is a mature individual with 
many years of service to this country as an employee of a defense contractor.  Many of the financial problems arose when he was much younger.  (Directive, &para; 
E2.1.1.4.)  The financial problems arose primarily due to circumstances beyond his control, including his separation and divorce, and several substantial periods 
of unemployment.  (Directive, &para; E2.1.1.2.)  The financial delinquencies arose because Applicant was unable to pay his bills, not because he was unwilling to do 
so.  (Directive, &para; E2.1.1.7.)  His failure to comply with company policy concerning payment of corporate credit card debts was an isolated incident that occurred 
several years ago.  Applicant has acted reasonably to repay his debts; significantly, he began repaying overdue accounts well before the initiation of this action.  
His financial situation is stable and he has made real progress toward eliminating delinquencies.  I am persuaded there is little likelihood of continuation or 
reoccurrence of financial problems.  (Directive, &para; E2.1.1.4.)  I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his history of failing to meet his 
financial obligations and his personal conduct. </SPAN></P>
