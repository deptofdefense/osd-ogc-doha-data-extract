<P>Applicant failed to mitigate the foreign preference security concern raised by his dual U.S.-Lebanese citizenship and foreign influence security concerns raised

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 3 August 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-22643.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 29 August 2004 and elected to have a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 9 November 2004.  On 17 November 2004, at the request of Applicant for expedited handling 
of his case, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 24 November 2004.</P> 
 
<P>With the agreement of Department Counsel, I kept the record open until 1 December 2004 to allow Applicant an opportunity to surrender his Canadian passport 
to Canadian authorities.  On 18 November 2004, Applicant submitted evidence from the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., that his passport had been 
canceled.  Exs. DD, EE.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 46-year-old computer network administrator for a defense contractor doing business with the U.S. Army in Kuwait.  His supervisors have attested 
to his talent, dedication to duty, and support for the mission.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant was born and raised in Lebanon.  Although he lived in Lebanon until he was 16 years old, he traveled every year until 1970 to Ghana, where his 
father sold cars, computers, and spare parts.  In 1974, he went to Saudi Arabia for two years to work construction.  He then traveled to Germany to find a 
university he could attend.  He was not accepted at any of the German universities, so in 1977, he moved to Kuwait.  There, he worked in sales and later as a 
flight attendant for the national airline.  In 1985, Applicant moved to Canada, eventually becoming a Canadian citizen in 1988 or 1989.  He was employed by an 
investment company to support visits by potential Kuwaiti investors when they visited Canada.  Later he became a sales manager for an electronics retailer.  He 
acquired a Canadian passport, but maintained his Lebanese passport.</P> 
 
<P>Two of Applicant's brothers are U.S. citizens.  They spent 10 years trying to get Applicant into the U.S.  Shortly after he became a Canadian citizen, Applicant 
was accepted for immigration to the U.S.  He held several jobs after entering the U.S., one of which was with a Department of Justice contractor that required 
him to obtain a clearance.  </P> 
 
<P>From May 1998-September 2000, Applicant worked in Kuwait for a defense contractor.  While he was in Kuwait, he married a Lebanese woman who was 
employed by the Kuwaiti national airline.  While working in Kuwait, Applicant was notified that he had been accepted for naturalization in the U.S.  He 
returned to the U.S. in October 1999 and received his U.S. citizenship and U.S. passport.  He then returned to his job and family in Kuwait.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant applied for a security clearance by submitting an application (SCA) in October 2000.  In June 2002, he renewed his Canadian passport.  In August 
2004, Applicant submitted his renunciation of his Canadian citizenship to the Canadian Consulate in Kuwait.  In August 2004, he submitted his Canadian 
passport to the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., and it was canceled.  Applicant allowed his Lebanese passport to expire in January 2003.  Applicant 
did not use his Canadian or Lebanese passports after he obtained his U.S. citizenship and passport.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant's wife is still a Lebanese citizen, but has a U.S. immigrant visa.  She has applied for U.S. citizenship.  Applicant and his wife have three children, all 
born in Kuwait.  The three children are now U.S. citizens.  Applicant's mother is a permanent resident of the U.S., but is currently residing in Lebanon.  
Applicant's five sisters, his mother-in-law, and two of his wife's sisters are citizen residents of Lebanon.  Applicant's wife also has a sister who lives in Kuwait 
and a brother who lives in England.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant travels to Lebanon on occasion to visit his mother.  The last time he visited was July 2004.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant has a bank account in Kuwait that he uses to pay for his rent and utilities.  Applicant and his family stay in his time-share when they visit his mother 
in Lebanon.  He is selling the time-share to his brother.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United 
States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, 
reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by 
regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995).  
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline C--Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant exercised dual citizenship with the U.S. and Canada (&para; 1.a) and Lebanon (&para; 1.b).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When an applicant acts in such a way 
as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the U.S., then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of 
the U.S.  Directive &para; E2.A3.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Although the allegations contained in SOR &para; 1 are rather vague--they fail to explain what Applicant specifically did that amounted to an exercise of dual 
citizenship--the evidence clearly supports a finding that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Lebanon by retaining his passport after he became a U.S. 
citizen and obtained a U.S. passport, and exercised dual citizenship with Canada by renewing and retaining his Canadian passport after he became a U.S. 
citizen.  DC E2.A3.1.2.1 and DC E2.A3.1.3.2.  The possession and use of a foreign passport disqualifies an applicant from obtaining a security clearance unless 
he surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use by the U.S. Government.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Memo. from Arthur L. Money, Asst Sec. Def. Command, 
Control, Communications, and Intelligence, to Directors of Defense Agencies, <EM>Guidance to DoD Central Adjudication Facilities (CAF) Clarifying the 
Application of the Foreign Preference Adjudicative Guideline</EM> (Aug. 16, 2000).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant took appropriate measures to renounce his Canadian citizenship and have his passport canceled.  MC E2.A3.1.3.4.  Although his Lebanese passport 
expired, Applicant failed to produce any evidence he had renounced his Lebanese citizenship.  I find against Applicant on &para; 1.b.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Guideline B--Foreign Influence</STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant's wife (&para; 2.a), his mother (&para; 2.b), and his parents-in-law (&para; 2.d) are citizen residents of Lebanon; one of his son's is a 
citizen of Canada residing with Applicant in Saudi Arabia (&para; 2.c); he has resided in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia continuously since May 2001 (&para; 2.e); and he owns 
a time-share in Beirut, Lebanon (&para; 2 .f).  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by 
affection, influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the U.S. or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A2.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Government's evidence and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of a potentially disqualifying condition under Guideline B--members of 
Applicant's immediate family--his mother, five sisters, wife, and children--are present in foreign countries.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  It is also a security concern for an 
applicant to have foreign associates to whom he has close ties of affection or obligation present in a foreign country.  DC E2.A2.1.2.1.  There is a rebuttable 
presumption that an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, immediate members of his spouse's family.  ISCR Case No. 01-26893, 2002 DOHA 
LEXIS 505 at *8 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).  Applicant failed to rebut the presumption that he has ties of affection or at least obligation to his mother-in-law and 
sisters-in-law who are citizen residents of Lebanon.</P> 
 
<P>These security concerns raised by Applicant's foreign associates may be mitigated if they are not agents of a foreign power and are not in a position to be 
exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and loyalty to the U.S.  MC E2.A2.1.3.1.  
Applicant's family members and foreign associates are not "agents of a foreign power."  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b).  But their presence in volatile countries such 
as Lebanon and Kuwait put them in a position of vulnerability to exploitation such that Applicant could be forced to choose between his loyalty to his family 
and his loyalty to the U.S.</P> 
 
<P>The fact that Applicant has resided in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia continuously since May 2001 would not, under normal conditions be a security concern because 
he was working for a defense contractor on U.S. Army projects.  But it becomes a security concern when placed in context of his numerous family contacts in 
the Middle East.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's interest in a time-share in Lebanon is a minor financial matter.  I find for Applicant on &para; 2.f.  MC E2.A2.1.3.5.</P> 
 
<P>Determining suitability for a security clearance requires a predictive judgment--it is an attempt to determine who <EM>might </EM>pose a security risk at some future time, 
based on certain established guidelines.  As noted above, the decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a judgment of an applicant's loyalty.  
Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  It is merely a determination the applicant has not met the strict guidelines set out by the President and the Secretary of Defense.  Under all 
the circumstances of this case, I am unable to conclude the foreign influence security concerns have been mitigated.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E--Personal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts on his SCA by failing to disclose his active Canadian and Lebanese passports (3.a).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct 
involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could 
indicate the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>It is a condition that may be disqualifying if an applicant deliberately omits or falsifies relevant and material facts in an SCA  DC E2.A5.1.2.2.  The 
Government established by substantial evidence that Applicant failed to disclose in his SCA (Ex. 1) that he had active Canadian and Lebanese passports.  
Although he did sign Ex. 1, Applicant actually completed a hand-written worksheet that was used by another person to input Applicant's answers into the 
computer.  In his hand-written application, Applicant admitted he had a Canadian passport.  I find Applicant's statement that he just did not think about his 
Lebanese passport to be credible.  After considering all of the circumstances, I am convinced Applicant did not deliberately omit or falsify relevant and material 
facts from his SCA.  I find for Applicant. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
