<P>Applicant has a history of delinquent debts he jointly and severally accrued prior to separation from his spouse in 1996.  Altogether, the debts he accumulated 
exceed $8,000.00 and have not been repaid to date, save for one small creditor and a good faith payment towards a large unpaid balance on one of his major 
debts.  While Applicant is to be encouraged in identifying and contacting his creditors in the past year, his repayment efforts remain too much a work in 
progress to make any safe predictable judgments at this time about his debt resolution prospects.  Applicant fails to extenuate or mitigate security concerns 
associated with his delinquent debts.  By contrast, he successfully refutes allegations of falsification of his security clearance application (SF-86).  Clearance is 
denied.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF CASE</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On December 22, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant responded to the SOR on January 21, 2004, and requested a hearing.  The case was assigned to me on March 15, 2004, and was scheduled for hearing 
on April 8, 2004.  A hearing was convened on April 8, 2004, for the purpose of considering whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, 
continue, deny or revoke Applicant's security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of six exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses 
(including himself) and 13 exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) of the proceedings was received on April 20, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL ISSUES</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Before the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the record with documentation of payment arrangements and payment made with one 
of his listed creditors (creditor 1.e).  There being no objections from  Department Counsel, and good cause being shown, Applicant was afforded an additional 7 
days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn, was afforded 7 days in which to respond.  Within the time provided, Applicant supplemented the 
record with a cover letter and copy of a $200.00 check to creditor 1.e.  The submission is accepted without objection as Applicant's exhibit M.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SUMMARY OF PLEADINGS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>.</CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have been accumulated delinquent debts: nine in  all totaling in excess of $11,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his SF-86 of July 1999 by failing to disclose (a) his repossessed vehicle by creditor 1.e, (b) his debts 
over 180 days delinquent, and &copy;) his debts over 90 days delinquent.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted one of his debts (his debt to creditor 1.c) and his repossession by creditor 1.e, but denied the balance of the 
alleged debts as debts that were not his.  He claimed to have contacted these alleged creditors, several of which have removed their accounts from Applicant's 
credit report.  Applicant denied falsifying his SF-86, claiming both the vehicle repossessed and the alleged delinquent debts were obligations that should have 
been taken care of by his wife in his absence, and of which he was not aware when he completed his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 43-year-old functional analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by 
Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Between 1978 and 1998 Applicant served on active military duty.  Applicant married W in 1979 and together they have two children (ages 16 and 18).  In 1996, 
Applicant and W separated.  Their two daughters have continued to reside with W during their separation.  Applicant and W remain married despite their 
lengthy separation.  Applicant continues to pay the mortgage on the home that W and the children continue to reside in.  He also maintains an account to receive 
$413.00 bi-weekly deposits he uses to pay W to assist her and the children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Both prior and after their separation, W opened up a number of consumer accounts that are carried jointly with Applicant (<EM>see</EM> ex. 2).  She had Applicant's 
power of attorney during his military deployments, and with the power of appointment was able to open joint accounts.  Applicant relied on W to pay their bills 
during his pre-separation deployments.  Because she oft-failed to do so, a number of their accounts were charged off.  W has not paid anything on these 
accounts that can be documented.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After receiving interrogatories from the Government in September 2003, Applicant checked his credit report for the first time in many years and informed 
himself of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR.  He denied responsibility for any of these debts, however, and either claimed mistaken identity or W 
responsibility for the debts.  Through his ensuing written requests to credit reporting agencies, he was able to obtain the removal of most of the listed debts from 
his latest credit report (<EM>see</EM> ex. I).  Whether these debts were removed due to mistaken identity or because more than seven years have elapsed is unknown.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant now acknowledges several of the listed debts in the SOR as his own.  He admits responsibility for the deficiency remaining from the repossession of 
a leased vehicle in 1997.  This debt represents the balance due on a vehicle Applicant leased for W while he was deployed in the military.  W was supposed to 
make the monthly payments on the vehicle while he was away on deployment, but evidently did not.  Creditor 1.e repossessed the vehicle in 1997, following 
Applicant's separation from W.  That this debt was also removed from his credit report upon his request is more indicative of the debt's age (over seven years) 
than its belonging to someone other than Applicant.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Besides creditor 1.e, Applicant was responsible for initiating debts carrying joint and several credit card responsibility with creditor 1.b (in February 1984), 
creditor 1.c (in August 1994), creditor 1.f (in December 1994), and creditor 1.h (in November 1994) before his separation from W.  While W might have 
continued to use these credit cards after her separation from Applicant, Applicant by all accounts remained jointly and severally responsible for their payment 
pending written notification of legal separation and renunciation of payment responsibility for any future incurred debts on the accounts.  Applicant provides no 
proof he ever placed his creditors on notice of his separation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By the time of his separation from W in 1996, Applicant's accrued debt with creditor 1.b was still in good standing.  The account remained in good standing as 
of February 2000, according to Applicant's February 2000 credit report (<EM>see</EM> ex. 6).   By January 2002, the creditor 1.b debt had been charged off.  Still, 
Applicant remained legally responsible for this $560.00 debt, absent notice to the creditor of his legal separation and renunciation of responsibility for future 
purchases.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Similarly, Applicant's accrued debt with creditor 1.e remained in good standing prior to his separation from W in 1996.  Applicant had leased the vehicle in his 
own name for W's benefit prior to his separation from W.  W retained the leased vehicle following their separation, and Applicant  understood that W would be 
making the required monthly payments on the vehicle (R.T., at 85-87).  Because W became delinquent in her payments to creditor 1.e, the creditor  repossessed 
the leased vehicle in 1997 (<EM>see</EM> ex. 6).  Like creditor 1.e, Applicant's creditor 1.f debt had been charged off by February 2000 as well, according to Applicant's 
February 2000 credit report (ex. 6).  This charged off debt also remains the joint and several obligation of Applicant.  As for creditor 1.h, this debt was charged 
off in 1995, according to Applicant's February 2000 credit report, and has remained so.  It is also a debt attributable to both W and Applicant, absent 
documented notice of Applicant's legal separation to the creditor (none of record).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The balance of Applicant's debts (<EM>i.e.,</EM> creditors 1.a, 1.d, 1.g and 1.I) appear to have been opened after Applicant's separation from W, without any evidenced 
Applicant authorization or notice, and cannot in fairness be attributed to Applicant.  While the possibility exists that these debts belong to neither W nor 
Applicant, Applicant has not supplied sufficient proof to support any drawn inferences of misidentification. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The debts attributable to Applicant (<EM>viz., </EM>creditors 1.b, 1.e, 1.f and 1.h) account for over $8,000.00 of the aggregate $11,000.00 in listed delinquent debt in the 
SOR.  Applicant has made little effort to repay any of these debts since he became manifestly aware of them in September 2003. His only evidenced payments 
are the agreed upon $206.00 payment to creditor 1.c (a debt he previously disputed as his) and the $200.00 good faith payment he recently made to creditor 1.e 
(<EM>see</EM> ex. J).  Applicant continues to try to work out repayment arrangements with the rest of his creditors, but to date has been unsuccessful.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Asked to complete his SF-86 in July 1999, Applicant answered <STRONG>no </STRONG>to question 35 (inquiring about repossessions in the past seven years).  Applicant attributed 
his omission to memory lapse and confusion over primary responsibility for the debt after his separation from W in 1996.  Applicant's explanations are credible 
enough to warrant acceptance.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In answering his July 1999 SF-86, Applicant also answered <STRONG>no </STRONG>to question 38 (debts over 180 days delinquent) and question 39 (debts over 90 days delinquent).  
In so answering, Applicant omitted, <EM>inter alia, </EM>debts jointly and severally incurred by Applicant and W prior and during their separation (<EM>viz., </EM>as to creditors 1.a 
through 1.I).  Applicant has continued to dispute each of these debts, claiming they were either debts his wife assumed responsibility for or are unaccounted for.  
While most of these debts are attributed to him by virtue of his continued joint and several liability to the creditors, their delinquent status was not known to 
Applicant of their delinquent status until he obtained a copy of his credit report in 2003 (R.T., at 65-67).  No inference of knowing and wilful omission may be 
fairly attributed to Applicant based on his sincere, but mistaken, understanding at the time he completed his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has received excellent performance marks with his employer in all of thes rated categories in his performance evaluation and by all accounts is well 
regarded by his superiors and coworkers (<EM>see </EM>ex. L).</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive (Change 4) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  
These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the "Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying" (Disqualifying Conditions), 
if any, and all of the "Mitigating Conditions," if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The 
Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must 
take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the 
Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are pertinent herein:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern:</EM> An individual who is financially overextended is at risk at having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Unexplained influence is often 
linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating Conditions</STRONG></SPAN></P>

medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">MC 6.  The individual initiated good-faith efforts to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>Personal Conduct</CENTER> 
</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>The Concern</EM>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate 
that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Disqualifying Conditions:</STRONG> None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Mitigating conditions:</STRONG> None.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><CENTER>Burden of Proof</STRONG>  </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">By virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding 
that to do so is <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">clearly</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">consistent</SPAN> with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the 
evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and 
materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the 
evidence of record.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the 
facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, 
does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or 
revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the 
purpose of establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSION</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant and his spouse accrued considerable delinquent debt prior to their separation in 1996.  The debt was jointly and severally created either through 
Applicant and his wife directly or through W's use of the power of appointment Applicant gave to W during his military deployments.  Altogether, Applicant 
accumulated over $8,000.00 of his listed $11,000.00 debt prior to his 1996 separation.  Applicant denies any legal responsibility for the debt created after his 
separation from W, a claim the Government questions, absent creditor documentation.  The Government's security concerns center on the amount of delinquent 
debt he compiled between 1994 and 1999 and his ensuing omissions of these debts from his pertinent answers to his SF-86.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Financial Issues</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Relying on his spouse to take care of the credit accounts initiated before their separation in 1996, Applicant failed to follow-up to ensure W was paying the 
debts he was jointly and severally liable for.  Most of the aggregate listed debt (over $8,000.00) in the SOR remains the joint and several responsibility of 
Applicant.  Together, the debts comprising aggregate delinquent debt   attributed to Applicant as well as W represent over 70 per cent of the accrued debt write 
off.  On this record, two of the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) of the Adjudicative Guidelines for financial considerations apply: DC 1 (history of not meeting 
financial obligations) and DC 3 (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant's accrued debts are accompanied by some extenuating circumstances (<EM>viz., </EM>reliance on W to pay the debts during his frequent deployments 
abroad and his ensuing separation), Applicant may not escape responsibility for payment of his debts for so long as he remained jointly and severally 
responsible.  He had a duty to keep himself informed of the status of his debts by checking periodically with W, and if unsuccessful, by ordering his credit 
report.  Applicant appears to have chosen neither of these options before his receipt of the Government's interrogatories in September 2003.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's debts are neither extenuated nor mitigated enough to enable him to take advantage of any of the mitigating conditions at this time.  His separation 
from W does not excuse his failure to monitor the status of the debts assumed in his name before his separation.  Extenuation is not, accordingly, demonstrated 
sufficiently to invoke MC 3 (conditions largely beyond the person's control) of the Guidelines.  And while he has paid one of the debts and made a payment on 
another, his overall repayment efforts remain a work in progress and insufficient at this time to invoke any of the mitigating conditions of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines, primarily MC 6 (initiated good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors) based on his repayment efforts.    The Appeal Board has counseled against 
according much weight to belated efforts to address delinquent debts well after the security clearance process has been initiated.  <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 02-33581 
(July 20, 2004).  To Applicant's credit, he has since taken steps to identify his creditors and accept responsibility for some of his debts.  His efforts are not of 
sufficient strength at this time, however, to enable him to mitigate security concerns associated with his longstanding delinquent debts.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taking into account all of the circumstances of Applicant's accumulated debts, the absence of sufficient attention he has shown with his debts in the past, and 
recent efforts in identifying and addressing his debts, unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.b, 1.e, 1.f and 1.h as to the allegations 
governed by the Adjudicative Guidelines pertinent to Guideline F.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g and 1.I of the 
allegations covered by Guideline F.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Falsification Concerns</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Posing potential security concerns, too, are Applicant's documented omissions of his covered repossession and delinquent debts from the SF-86 he completed 
in July 1999.  His omissions are, however, attributable to memory lapse (as to creditor 1.e) and uncertainty over whether his other debts belonged to him when 
he completed his SF-86.  While Applicant could reasonably have been expected to be more diligent about checking on  the status of his debts with his wife and 
credit reporting companies before 2003, his judgment lapses are not enough to impute knowing and wilful falsification under Guideline E.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Applicant's explanations of his omissions (memory lapse and uncertainty over the payment status of his joint and several consumer obligations) are persuasive 
enough to avert inferences of knowing and wilful omission.  There being no misconduct substantiated, no need to show extenuation or mitigation arises.  <EM>Cf. 
</EM>ISCR Case No. 02-13568 (February 13, 2004).  While Applicant's efforts lack due diligences inquiries of the state of his debts,  his failing to inquire does not 
equate to knowing and wilful omission.   Applicant's accepted memory lapse and mistaken reliance on his wife's ownership and payment responsibility for the 
debts in issue enable him to refute the allegations of falsification of his SF-86 covered in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c, governed by Guideline E. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the 
Directive.</SPAN></P>
