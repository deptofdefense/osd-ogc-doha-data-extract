<P>Applicant has several immediate family members who are citizens of and reside in India, but they are not in a position to be exploited by India in a way that 
could force Applicant to choose between loyalty to these family members and his loyalty to the United States. Applicant has some financial interest in India, but 
his strong attachment to the United States makes it unlikely that he would respond favorably to any efforts to act against United States interests.  Mitigation has 
been shown. Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On February 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On </SPAN>March 27, 2003<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN>DOHA<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> received Applicant's signed and sworn, undated response. Applicant requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 5, 2003, this case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, but on May 6, 2003, because of caseload consideration, the case was reassigned to me 
to conduct a hearing and issue a written decision. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on May 7, 2003, and the hearing was held on May 23, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1 - 5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered one documentary 
exhibit (Exhibit A) and offered his own testimony and the testimony of one other witness. The transcript (TR) was received on June 3, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative Guideline B of the Directive because Applicant's immediate family, and 
other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation, are not United States citizens or may be subject to duress, that he has some 
financial interest in India and that he has traveled to his native India on a number of occasions. </SPAN>The SOR contains nine allegations, 1.a. through 1.i., under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  In his response to the SOR, Applicant admits all nine allegations. These allegations are incorporated as findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, and upon 
due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 50 years old. He <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">was born in India in 1952, moved to the United States in 1983, and became a naturalized United States citizen in 1990. He has a 
bachelors degree in math and science, and an associates degree in computer science.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's wife was born in India, married the Applicant and came to the United States with him in1983. She also became a naturalized </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">United States citizen 
with her husband in 1990. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and his </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">wife</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> have two children. Their daughter is a native born United States citizen, and their son, who was 
approximately two years old when they moved here, is also a United States citizen. (Tr at 31-34.)</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's father and mother, three siblings, mother in-law and six extended family members are citizens of </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and reside in India</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant's father is 82 years 
old, retired and in failing health.  Applicant places telephone calls to his father approximately every ten days, in large part, because of his poor health.  He also 
keeps a bank account of approximately $5,000 to help his father with his medical expenses. (Tr at 23, 24.) Applicant's mother is a retired housewife. His 
brother works for a private company, and he is currently working and living with his immediate family in Australia. His two sisters and his mother-in-law are 
housewives. Of Applicant's three brothers-in-law, one lives in the United States and is a United States citizen, the second one is a farmer, and the third brother-in-law works for an agency of the Indian government in the general services department in a low level position. He is the only one of Applicant's family 
members who is employed in any capacity by the government of India, and Applicant has minimal contact with him. I have determined that there is no risk that 
Applicant could be influenced negatively by the Indian government against the interests of the United States because of his family's employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant also keeps $200 in an account in India simply as a convenience so that when he travels to India it will be easier to get available cash.  (Tr at 24, 25.)    
His travels to India are made to see his family and for specific family events.  He visited India in the year1999 to attend the funeral of his father in-law, in 2000 
for his parents' fiftieth wedding anniversary and in 2002 to see his ailing father. (Tr at 45-47.)</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant does have some additional financial interests in India.  He provided approximately $20,000 to $25,000 to build a home for his parents. Applicant 
estimates that the house is now worth about $30,000. Applicant does not know who legally owns the house but he considers it to belong to his parents.  His 
wife also has a part interest in the farm of her brother in India, which Applicant estimates to be worth approximately $6,000 to $8,000. (Tr at 55-57.) It is not 
clear how much, if any, of this may eventually be of value to Applicant. However, even if Applicant stood to inherit all of the monetary value from these 
properties, I conclude that when considering Applicant's family and their history in the United States, and his extremely strong testimony about his feelings 
concerning the United States, this financial interest is not significant enough to cause Applicant to do anything which would be contrary to the interests of the 
United States.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition to Applicant, one witness testified on behalf of Applicant.  The witness is the Assistant Security Facility Security Officer of the company by which 
Applicant is employed.   The witness testified that the company regarded him very highly as a skilled consultant.</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">(Tr at 62-65.)</SPAN><STRONG></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">that must be carefully</SPAN> considered<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN>in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">making the 
overall common sense determination required. </SPAN>The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each 
area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not 
determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect 
consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account 
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Each adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, and the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the 
conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the 
conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of 
Enclosure 2).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FOREIGN INFLUENCE</SPAN> (GUIDELINE B) </STRONG></P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.2.8. A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the individual vulnerable to foreign 
influence.</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</P> 
 
<P>E2.A2.1.3.1. A determination that the immediate family member(s). . . in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign 
power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3.1. Foreign financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </P> 
 
<P>the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM></SPAN>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Based on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny Applicant a security clearance because of </SPAN>Guideline B (Foreign 
Influence) <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. Applicant's immediate family members are citizens of and reside in </SPAN>the India. The Indian citizenship and residency of members of Applicant's 
immediate family create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially 
vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in 
rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a 
security clearance for him.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>  The evidence of existence of <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">immediate family members</SPAN>, who are citizens of and reside in, India comes within Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1.  However, 
based on the nature of the overall record, including: the lack of government involvement of Applicant's family members, Applicant's family history since 
coming to the United States,<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> his extremely strong testimony about his feelings concerning the United States</SPAN> and the close relationship of India to the United 
States, I have determined that his family members in India do not constitute an unacceptable security risk and Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1 applies.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant also has some financial interest in India which is a concern under DC  8. However, MC 5 applies, <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">even if Applicant stood to gain all of the monetary 
value from property and money in India.</SPAN> The financial interests are not <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">significant enough to cause Applicant to do anything which would be contrary to the 
interests of the United States. </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>After considering all of the evidence of record on these issues, I conclude that, even in the unlikely event pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise 
classified information, he would resist it, and would  report the incident to the proper authorities. </P>
