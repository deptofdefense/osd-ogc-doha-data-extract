<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant was convicted of driving an automobile while under the influence of alcohol on four occasions between April 1990 and May 2001. He attended 
alcohol abuse programs following the first three, failed to attend a court-directed program after the last arrest, and has now volunteered to participate in a 
university-sponsored research project designed to see if the addition of medication will aid in preventing a relapse to drinking. He has never attended Alcoholics 
Anonymous meetings, although he does believe he was an alcoholic in the past. Applicant  has failed to mitigate the security concerns that arise from his 
alcohol consumption. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 24, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline G, alcohol consumption. Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR that was notarized on August 29, 
2003, requested a hearing, and admitted all the SOR allegations.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to me on October 31, 2003. A notice of hearing was issued on November 6, 2003, scheduling the hearing for November 25, 2003. The 
hearing was conducted as scheduled.  The government submitted seven documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-7 and admitted 
into the record without an objection. The Applicant testified, called one character witness, and submitted three documentary exhibits that were marked as 
Applicant's Exhibits (AE) 1-3 and admitted into the record without an objection. The transcript was received  December 8, 2003.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 42 years old and has been employed as an electronics technician by defense contractors since February 1991. He served on active duty with the 
United States Navy as a cryptologic technician from April 1981 to November 1990, attaining the rank of petty officer first class. He received an honorable 
discharge. Applicant was married in December 1995 and divorced in January 2000. He acknowledges that alcohol did play a part in the break up of his marriage 
in that he drank excessively because of the other issues in the marriage that caused discord.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI), Cutting Corner to Avoid Red Light, and Running Red Light on April 21, 1990. He was 
convicted of DUI and adjudication was withheld on the remaining offenses.  He was sentenced to probation for six months and fined a total of $546.50. The 
Navy required him to attend a Level I alcohol treatment program as a result of this conviction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was again charged with DUI on June 28, 1993. He was administered a breathalyser and his blood alcohol concentration registered in excess of 0.10. 
He was convicted of this offense and sentenced to a fine of an unknown amount and had his driving privileges suspended for six months.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Applicant was again 
required to attend an alcohol abuse program as a result of this conviction. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with DUI 2</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>nd</SUP> Offense on February 1, 1995. He was found guilty of this offense following a jury trial and sentenced to "1 YR &amp; $2000 
SUS UPON 48 HRS SATISFIED &amp; $1000."<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> No definitive finding can be made as to the sentence that imposed. Applicant was again required to attend an 
alcohol abuse program as a result of this conviction.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with Operating Under the Influence (OUI) in January 2001. He refused to submit to a breath test at the time of his arrest resulting in the 
automatic suspension of his driving privileges for ninety days. He pled guilty to the OUI in August 2001 and was sentenced to four days jail, fined $600.00, and 
lost his driving privileges for an additional six months. He was required to attend an alcohol awareness program to have his driving privileges reinstated, but 
has never done so.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a statement to a special agent from the Defense Security Service on April 22, 2002 in which he claimed he only consumed alcoholic 
beverages at his residence or in his hotel room while on travel. He also asserted in that statement that he drank two to three times weekly, usually not after 
6:00PM, and consumed two to six light beers when drinking. He testified he has not consumed alcohol since June 2003, and believes he was an alcoholic in the 
past. He has never attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant volunteered to participate in a university-sponsored research study project on September 9, 2003.  The purpose of the study is to determine if the 
addition of an additional medication to a typically prescribed medication for alcohol abuse will aid in the prevention of a relapse to drinking in the early weeks 
after stopping drinking. As part of the project, Applicant visits a mental health professional once a week to discuss how he is doing.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The testimony provided by Applicant's character witness and the letters of recommendation Applicant submitted attest to the fact that he is well regarded in the 
workplace, although he has been counseled and reprimanded on occasion because of his alcohol-related arrests. He has held a security clearance for many years 
without any complaints being made concerning his handling of classified material or action taken to revoke or downgrade a clearance before the action herein.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G, 
pertaining to alcohol consumption, with its respective DC and MC, is most relevant in this case.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>BURDEN OF PROOF</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="02-17909.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline G, alcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, 
unreliability, failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Those who abuse 
alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high risk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior.  Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of intoxication 
may affect an individual's ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion necessary to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was convicted of four alcohol-related driving offenses between April 1990 and August 2001. On each of those occasions he was court-ordered to 
attend some type of alcohol abuse program. He attended three of the programs, but failed to the attend the one that was ordered as a condition of having his 
driving privileges reinstated in 2001. He considers himself to have been an alcoholic in the past, but he has never sought out the assistance of AA or a similar 
program. Only recently has he volunteered to participate in an experimental program to test the effects of the administration of medications as an aid to drinking 
cessation. Although he claims to have not consumed alcohol since June 2003, there cannot be any reliable prediction made that he will not resume drinking in 
the future.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or other criminal incidents related 
to alcohol use</EM>; and DC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment </EM>apply in this case.  I have considered all the Mitigating 
Conditions under Guideline G and find that none apply in this case.  Guideline G is decided against Applicant. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfy his ultimate 
burden of persuasion.  It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN></P>
