</P>

<P>	On May 12, 1997, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to
Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,
1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent
with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied
or revoked.</P>

<P>	The SOR is attached.</P>

<P>	Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on June 16, 1997.</P>

<P>	Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.
Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 1, 1997. 
Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation
within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on July 8, 1997, and
Applicant's Response was received on August 14, 1997.  The case was received by the undersigned
for resolution on August 15, 1997.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's drug abuse
militates against the granting of a security clearance.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the File of
Relevant Material and Applicant's Response.  The Applicant is 37 years of age, and is employed by
a defense contractor as a Senior Software Engineer.  He currently holds no security clearance, but
his employer seeks one on behalf of the Applicant.</P>

<P><U>Criterion H - Drug involvement</U></P>

<P>	1.a.~1.c.  The Applicant used marijuana, "about 2 times per week" from 1987 through
January of this year, 1997 (Government Exhibit (GX) 5 at page 1).  The Applicant also purchased
marijuana on numerous occasions.  As to his future intentions regarding the use of this drug, in a
sworn statement dated January 31, 1997, he averred, "In the future I probably will continue to use
marijuana for relaxation purposes" (GX 5 at page 1).  In his Response, however, the Applicant now
submits that he intends no future use of marijuana (Response at page 3).</P>

<P><U>Mitigation</U></P>

<P>	In his Response, the Applicant offers laudatory comments from his employer (Response at
pages 6 and 7).</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	Enclosure 2 and Section F.3. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and
conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration
in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions<FONT FACE="Times"> should be followed in every case
</FONT>according to the pertinent criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative
of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own
common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and
circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions exhaust the realm of human
experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</P>

<P><CENTER><U>Drug Involvement</U></CENTER>
</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could raise a security concern</U>:</P>

<P>	(1) any drug abuse (drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner
that deviates from approved medical direction);</P>

<P>	(2) illegal drug possession, . . . purchase . . . .</P>

<P><U>Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</U>:</P>

<P>	(3) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future;</P>

<P>	As set forth in the Directive,"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common
sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the
pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</P>

<P>		a. Nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding
circumstances.</P>

<P>		b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P>

<P> 		c. Age of the applicant.</P>

<P>		d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct
was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of
the consequence involved.</P>

<P>		e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P>

<P>		f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in
the future.</P>

<P>	The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have
a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or
conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P>

<P>	The Government must make out a <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U> case under Criterion H (drug involvement)
which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational
connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to
effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational
connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P>

<P>	Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,
explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely
to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P>

<P>	The improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's
willingness or ability to protect classified information. The Government must be able to place a high
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at
all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his
private affairs, then there exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude
towards security rules and regulations.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></CENTER>
</P>

<P>	The Applicant's marijuana abuse spans a period of nearly ten years.  During this period of
time he used the drug "about 2 times per week (GX 5 at page 1), and his last usage was less than
seven  months ago (the date of the Applicant's Response to the Government's FORM ends the time
line used for adjudication purposes in this case).  It now appears that the Applicant intends no future
drug abuse, however, it is too soon to say that his fairly recent usage is not of present security
significance.</P>

<P>	Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's <U>prima</U> <U>facie</U>
case regarding his drug involvement.  The Applicant has thus not met the mitigating conditions of
Criterion H, and of Section F.3. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden
of persuasion under Criterion H.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</P>

<P>Paragraph 1:<CENTER>AGAINST THE APPLICANT</CENTER>
</P>

<P>	a.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	b.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>	c.	Against the Applicant.</P>

<P>Factual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in <STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG> and
<STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG>, <U>supra</U>.</P>

<P><U><CENTER><STRONG>DECISION</STRONG></CENTER>
</U></P>

<P>	In light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent
with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.</P>
