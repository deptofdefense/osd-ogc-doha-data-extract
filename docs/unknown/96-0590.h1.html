<P>On August 23, 1996, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (copy appended) to                     (Applicant), which detailed reasons why DOHA could
not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance
for applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P>

<P>The applicant responded to the SOR in writing on September 17, 1996. The case was received by the undersigned on October 22, 1996, and a Notice of Hearing
was issued on January 16, 1997. A hearing was held on January 31, 1997.</P>

<P><U><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></U></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant is a thirty-one year old married man. He has been employed by the same defense contractor since 1989. He has held a DoD Top Secret security
clearance since 1990.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Criterion H</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency, at times on a daily basis, from approximately 1983 through 1994.  In 1995, he used it "maybe a dozen or
so" times, and in 1996 he used it "about" twice (TR at 17). He last used it in February or March 1996. He purchased marijuana during the time was using
it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant used methamphetamine with varying frequency, at times three times a week, during a six month period in 1984. He did not use it between 1984
and 1992. From 1992 to March 1994, he used it with varying frequency, at times weekly. Since March 1994, he used it two or three times. He testified that
he used it "maybe" twice in 1995, and once in March 1996 (TR at 22-23). Applicant purchased methamphetamine in the 1980s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">During 1984 or 1985, applicant used LSD once, Quaaludes once, cocaine two times, and hashish "maybe three or four times." He purchased the Quaaludes
and hashish, and "may have" purchased the LSD (TR at 24, 26-27).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant received outpatient counseling for marijuana, methamphetamine and alcohol abuse from March 4, 1994 to October 25, 1994. Applicant sought the
counseling after coming to the realization that he "did have a problem and that (he) could not solve it by (himself)" (TR at 27). Applicant testified that he
had "an addiction" (TR at 20, 55).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Although applicant does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future, he acknowledged the difficulty he faces in trying to remain clean and sober. In a signed,
sworn statement that he gave to the Defense Investigative Service (DIS) on April 16, 1996 (G-2), he stated the following:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">"I cannot state unequivocally that I will never use an illegal drug in the future. That would not be an honest statement to make at this time. As long as I
consider myself to be a recovering illegal drug user, the danger exists that I can use illegal drugs again. I am considering to return to counseling to deal with
my problem and I anticipate that it can be resolved. I am very concerned about having those relapses  and I will try to stop them from happening again;
perhaps counseling is the answer."</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Criteria E and J</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">From the time he was hired by his current employer in 1989 through October 25, 1995, applicant intentionally provided false, material information about his
involvement with illegal drugs and/or his use of alcoholic beverages to the DoD on at least six occasions. These falsifications are as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">1. On a Personnel Security Questionnaire (PSQ) that he executed on September 20, 1989, applicant (1) stated that his use of illegal drugs consisted of
experimenting with marijuana a few times before December 1985, and (2) denied that he ever purchased an illegal drug.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">2. In a signed, sworn statement that he gave to the DIS on May 15, 1990 (G-5), applicant stated the following:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">"I experimented with marijuana approximately twice a week until approximately Sep 85. This took place in the evenings when I was with friends. I have not
used any other illegal drugs or controlled substances and do not intend to use marijuana or other illegal drugs in the future."</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">3. On a PSQ that he executed on March 17, 1995, applicant denied that he had ever purchased or used an illegal drug. He also denied that his use of
alcoholic beverages had ever resulted in counseling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">4. During an August 2, 1995 interview with a Special Agent of the DIS, applicant stated that his involvement with marijuana consisted of using it twice a
week from the Spring or Summer of 1984 to September 1985.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">5. During a September 21, 1995 interview with a Special Agent of the DIS, applicant stated that his use of marijuana and amphetamines ended in September
1994.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">6. In a signed, sworn statement that he gave to the DIS on October 25, 1995 (G-2), applicant stated that he had last used marijuana and methamphetamine in
about September 1994.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant admits that he intentionally provided the false information on these six occasions. He initially lied to obtain a security clearance, and he continued
to lie in order to retain his security clearance. He told the complete truth about his drug use to a DIS Special Agent during a pre-polygraph interview in early
1996.</FONT></P>

<P><U><FONT FACE="Times">Character References</U></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant's wife appeared at the hearing and testified that applicant has been more responsible since he received the counseling, and that he is a dependable
and honest man.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant's supervisor during the past five years appeared at the hearing and testified that applicant is a reliable and trustworthy employee who does an
outstanding job. He further testified that he never observed applicant under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Letters from applicant's mother-in-law and second level supervisor were admitted in evidence. The mother-in-law states that applicant is a responsible and
dependable individual whose "integrity is beyond approach" (Exhibit A). The supervisor states that applicant is a "conscientious and dedicated employee."
He further states that he has "never observed him to be under the influence of any substance in the workplace" (Exhibit C).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth the Adjudication Policy (divided into Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors) which must be followed by the
Administrative Judge. Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are applicable:</FONT></P>

<P><STRONG><U>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></U></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In DOHA cases, the Government has the initial burden of producing evidence that reasonably suggests an applicant cannot be relied upon to safeguard
classified information. If the Government meets its burden, it has established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case. Once the Government establishes a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, the
burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence in refutation, extenuation, mitigation or reformation sufficient to establish that, notwithstanding the Government's
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case, he or she can be relied upon to safeguard classified information. In view of the Directive's requirement that a security clearance be granted
only upon a finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has a heavy burden.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">In this case, the Government established a </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">prima facie </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">case under Criterion H. The evidence establishes that applicant used marijuana with varying frequency,
at times on a daily basis, from approximately 1983 to February or March 1996; methamphetamine with varying frequency, at times three times a week, during a
six month period in 1984; methamphetamine on a less frequent basis from 1992 to March 1996; and numerous other illegal drugs, namely,  LSD, Quaaludes and
cocaine, in the 1980s. Applicant's abuse of these drugs reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, and reasonably suggests that he cannot
be relied upon to safeguard classified information for at least two reasons:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">First, individuals granted access to classified information are responsible for safeguarding it twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, on and off the job.
An applicant who abuses marijuana, methamphetamine, or any of the other illegal drugs that applicant has abused, cannot be relied upon to meet his or her
security responsibilities because the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified information through neglect or inattention while "high" on them is too great.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Second, applicant used marijuana and methamphetamine for many years with full knowledge that each time he used these drugs he was breaking the law. This
suggests that applicant may be unwilling to abide by security regulations if he finds them in conflict with his personal wishes or desires.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Applicant testified that he has not used an illegal drug since March 1996 and does not intend to use any illegal drug in the future. Although I found applicant's
testimony to be sincere, given the recency and extent of his marijuana and methamphetamine abuse,  the fact he used these drugs after he received the drug and
alcohol counseling, and the fact that he is not currently involved in any type of substance abuse recovery program, I cannot conclude that applicant will not use
illegal drugs in the future. For this reason, Criterion H is found against applicant.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">With respect to Criteria E and J, the evidence establishes that applicant intentionally provided false, material information about his involvement with illegal
drugs to the DoD on at least six different occasions. Applicant initially lied in order to obtain a security clearance; he continued to lie in order to retain the
security clearance. This dishonest conduct constitutes criminal conduct under Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times">Although applicant regrets lying to the Government, the fact remains that he repeatedly lied about his involvement with illegal drugs and/or his use of alcoholic
beverages over a period of at least five years, and revealed the complete truth only when faced with a polygraph examination. Applicant's dishonest and
criminal conduct reflects adversely on his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness, and strongly suggests that he cannot be relied upon to be truthful with the
Government. Given the recency (less than one year ago) and extent (six separate falsifications) of his criminal and dishonest conduct, I cannot conclude at the
present time that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him access to classified information. For this reason, Criteria E and J are found against
applicant.</FONT></P>

for applicant.</FONT></P>
