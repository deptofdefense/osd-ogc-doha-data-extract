<P>The Applicant's methamphetamine usage was more than five years ago; and as such, is not recent.  As a result of his past drug usage, however, the Applicant 
became financially overextended.  He has over $3,000 in past due debts to six different creditors that he has yet to address.  These Financial Considerations are 
of security significance; and as such, mitigation has not been shown.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On September 28, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 25, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant elected to have this case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's File of Relevant 
aterial (FORM) on December 3, 2004.  Applicant was instructed to submit objections or information in rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of 
receipt of the FORM.  Applicant received his copy on December 16, 2004, and submitted nothing in reply.  The case was received by the undersigned for 
resolution on February 2, 2005.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's past Drug Involvement and current Financial Considerations militate against 
the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, and the File of Relevant Material.  The Applicant is 45 years of age, and is 
employed by a defense contractor, who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant attributes the "majority" of his present financial difficulties to his past drug abuse, which will be discussed under Paragraph 2 of the SOR (Item 3 
at page 2).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.a.  The Applicant owes an emergency service about $252 in past due indebtedness (Item 6 at page 4).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.b.  The Applicant owes a credit card company about $261 in past due indebtedness (Item 6 at page 4).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.c.  The Applicant owes a bank about $1,955 in past due indebtedness (Item 6 at page 5).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.d.  The Applicant owes a national pizza chain about $47 in past due indebtedness (Item 6 at page 5).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.e.  The Applicant owes a medical doctor about $85 in past due indebtedness (Item 6 at page 5).  He has done nothing to address this past due debt.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.f. and 1.g.  The Applicant owes a municipality about $484 in past due indebtedness (Item 6 at page 6).  He has done nothing to address these two past due 
debts.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H - Drug Involvement</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2.a. and 2.b.  The Applicant "used Methamphetamines on a nearly daily basis" from about May of 1994 until his last usage in November of 1999 (Item 4 at 
page 8, and Item 5 at pages 4~5).  He used the drug despite being granted a security clearance in 1988 (Item 4 at page 9).  The Applicant intends "not to use any 
dangerous drugs in the future" (Item 4 at page 8).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Other than stating how he got into his present financial difficulties, and averring he intends no future drug abuse, the Applicant offers little in the way of 
mitigation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline H (Drug Involvement) which establishes doubt about a 
person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability 
to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering first the Applicant's Financial Considerations, he has in excess of $3,000 in past due indebtedness, dating back to his drug abuse days.  The first 
and third disqualifying conditions are therefore applicable in this case, as there is a "history of not meeting financial obligations," and an "unwillingness to 
satisfy debts."  I can find no countervailing mitigating conditions, as the Applicant has done nothing to address his past due debts.  Guideline F is therefore 
found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As to his past Drug Involvement, the Applicant used methamphetamine, on a "nearly daily" basis, during the middle to late 1990s.  The first disqualifying 
condition is therefore applicable, as there was "drug abuse."  This is countered, however, by the first mitigating condition, as the "drug involvement was not 
recent," having occurred more than five years ago.  Furthermore, the Applicant avers he will not use illegal drugs in the future.  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline 
H is therefore found for the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his Financial Considerations.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P>
