<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant used marijuana frequently between 1986 and 1997. He used several other controlled substances during that time on an experimental basis. 
Additionally, Applicant was arrested for several minor offenses between 1993 and 1995. Applicant failed to disclose the full extent of his abuse of controlled 
substances in a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) he submitted, and thereafter provided false information in a statement he made during his security 
clearance investigation. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concern that arises from his personal conduct in providing false answers in the SF 86 and 
during his interview. Clearance is denied. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On July 20, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, 
alleges security concerns under Guideline H for drug involvement, Guideline J for criminal conduct, and Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant submitted 
a sworn answer to the SOR, dated August 5, 2004. Applicant admitted all SOR allegations except subparagraphs 2.b., 2.d., 2.e., 3.a., and 3.b., and requested a 
hearing.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">This case was assigned to me on June 20, 2005. A notice of hearing was issued on June 29, 2005, scheduling the hearing for July 27, 2005. The hearing was 
conducted as scheduled. The government submitted 11 documentary exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-11, and admitted into the record 
without objection. Applicant testified at the hearing, and submitted six documentary exhibits that were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-6, and admitted 
into the record without objection. The transcript was received on August 5, 2005.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL MATTERS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">At the hearing Applicant sought to withdraw his admissions to SOR subparagraphs 2.c., 3.c., and 3.d., and to enter denials to those subparagraphs; and to 
withdraw his denial of subparagraph 2.b., and to enter an admission to that subparagraph. Department Counsel did not object to those requests and they were 
granted.  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 31 years old, and has been employed as a plumber by a defense contractor since September 2001. He previously worked as a plumber at a state 
university from July 1997 until September 2001, as a sales representative for two separate companies from April 1996 until July 1997, and was unemployed and 
living with his parents before then. Applicant was married in November 1996, and divorced in July 1999. He is presently remarried, has two children, and his 
wife is expecting a child in September 2005.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant began using marijuana in about 1986 when he was in 8</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SUP>th</SUP> grade and continued using it frequently until about October 1997. His estimates of how 
many times he used the drug have ranged from twice monthly from 1986/87 until 1990/91, and thereafter seven to eight times a day from 1990/91 until March 
1997 (GE 3), to more than a thousand times (Tr. p. 32). Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1997, and was promptly given an entry-level separation after he 
tested positive for having the marijuana metabolite in his system when he reported to boot camp in September 1997. He claimed in a written statement to have 
only used marijuana once, in approximately October 1997, after he was separated  from the Navy. (GE 3) However, he testified he used it on five occasions 
after he left the Navy. (Tr. pp. 64-65)</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used cocaine once in approximately 1994, hashish once in approximately 1995, and ingested two Rohypnol pills weekly during a three or four month 
period in 1994/95. (GE 3) Applicant initially testified his use of Rohypnol was unknowing because someone had put it in his drink without his knowledge. (Tr. 
p. 34 and 67) However, during cross-examination, and upon being confronted with his previous statement (GE 3), Applicant changed his testimony, claimed the 
first time he used Rohypnol was without his knowledge, and admitted using it voluntarily on subsequent occasions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was arrested on several occasions between 1993 and 1995 for relatively minor offenses, including Criminal Trespass, Lending Plates/Registration, 
Disorderly Conduct, Minor in Possession of Alcohol, various traffic offenses, and Violation of Promise to Appear. He was convicted of several of the offenses 
and sentenced to either perform brief periods of community service or pay small fines, with the exception of the Criminal Trespass charge for which he was 
placed on probation for 12 months and ordered to pay a fine in the amount of $500.00.<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>       </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on October 8, 2001. He failed to disclose he had been charged with Minor in Possession of 
Alcohol as required in response to question 24, and had been charged with and convicted of Criminal Trespass as required in response to question 26. In 
response to question 27, he disclosed he had used marijuana five times between July 1996 and September 1997, but failed to disclose his much greater use of 
the substance as discussed above. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a written statement to a Special Agent (SA) for the Defense Security Service (DSS) on July 9, 2003, in which he denied ever having 
illegally used any controlled substance other than marijuana, and acknowledged under reporting his use of marijuana because: "I did not want to reflect how 
often I really used marijuana but I did want to reflect that fact that I did use marijuana." He provided a second written statement to a SA for the DSS on 
September 17, 2003, in which he admitted using the controlled substances in addition to marijuana noted above. Applicant also stated at that time:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I listed on my SCA that I had used marijuana five times total between Jul 96 and Sep 97. I did not list any other illegal drug usage. I admit that I deliberately 
falsified my SCA by not truthfully detailing my use of illegal drugs. I did not indicate the truth on my SCA because I was afraid that my DoD security clearance 
would be denied. If my clearance is denied than [sic] perhaps I'll lose my job at (company name omitted).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">* * *</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I admit that I purposely did not tell SA (name omitted) the complete truth about my illegal drug usage because I was concerned that my security clearance 
would be denied and I might lose my job at (company name omitted). I acknowledge that by not disclosing the complete truth about my illegal drug usage, I 
provided a false sworn written statement, dated 09 Jul 03.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided a number of explanations at the hearing for not disclosing the required information, including: he thought the questions about drug use were 
only asking about "habitual" use (Tr. p. 51); he did not think the Minor in Possession of Alcohol charge was something that needed to be disclosed (Tr. p. 62); 
he couldn't remember if any of the convictions had occurred within seven years of when he submitted the SF 86 (Tr. p. 62); and the only times he could 
remember using marijuana within seven years of submitting the SF 86 were the five times after he was discharged from the Navy. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a letter from his supervisor who wrote that Applicant has proven himself to be a very reputable person who is highly respected by his co-workers and customers. The supervisor believes Applicant is a reliable, honest, and caring individual. Applicant is striving to better himself by attending and 
teaching at a community college.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,   Guideline H, 
pertaining to drug involvement, Guideline J, pertaining to criminal conduct, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, 
are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence,<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="03-23955.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In all adjudications the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, 
commonsense assessment of a person's trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the "whole person" concept recognizes we 
should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant 
circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H, illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information. Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law. Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not. 
If they do not respect the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used marijuana extensively from 1984 until 1997, and received an entry-level separation from the Navy in 1997 because he had the marijuana 
metabolite in his system when he reported for boot camp. Applicant also experimented with three other controlled substances between 1994 and 1995. 
Disqualifying Condition (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">applies.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant last used a controlled substance almost eight years ago. Since then, Applicant has been gainfully employed, has married and is raising a family, has 
attended and taught at a community college, and has earned the respect of his supervisor. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The drug involvement was not recent</EM>; 
and MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future </EM>apply. Applicant has mitigated the security concern caused by his abuse of marijuana and 
other controlled substances. Guideline H is decided for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness.  Willingness to abide by rules is an essential qualification for eligibility for access to the Nation's secrets. A history of illegal behavior 
indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with regulations, practices, or procedures concerning safeguarding and handling 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant committed and was convicted of several relatively minor criminal offenses between 1993 and 1995. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A single serious crime or multiple lesser 
offenses</EM> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">applies. The last alleged criminal offense occurred in 1995, and, although not alleged, Applicant stopped abusing controlled substances in 1997, and 
executed the SF 86 in 2001. Further, Applicant has substantially changed his lifestyle and demonstrated that he has significantly matured since the last alleged 
offense. Accordingly, MC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The criminal behavior was not recent</EM>: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">MC 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>. . . the factors leading to the violation are not likely to recur</EM>; and MC 6: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>There is 
clear evidence of successful rehabilitation </EM>apply. Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct security concern. Guideline J is decided for Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline E, personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant provided false answers to questions 24, 26, and 27 in the SF 86 he submitted, and false information to a SA for the DSS in a statement he provided in 
July 2003. Considering the minor nature of the criminal offenses, including the alcohol-related offense, and the length of time that had elapsed from their 
commission to when Applicant submitted the SF 86, his failure to list them is understandable and not indicative of a deliberate omission of relevant information 
from the SF 86. However, the same cannot be said about his failure to disclose the full extent of his marijuana abuse in the SF 86 or his abuse of other 
controlled substances in the July 2003 statement. Applicant's explanations at the hearing for those omissions are not credible. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's failure to disclose the extent of his marijuana abuse in the SF 86, and his use of other controlled substances in the July 2003 statement, along with 
the testimony he provided in an effort to justify those omissions, severely undermines the ability to place trust and confidence in him at the present time. The 
false answers, statements, and testimony raise significant security concerns. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>; and DC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant and 
material matters to an investigator, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination </EM>apply in this case. 
I have considered all Mitigating Conditions under Guideline E and find none apply. Guideline E is decided against Applicant.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the 
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to overcome the case against him and satisfy his ultimate 
burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. </SPAN></P>
