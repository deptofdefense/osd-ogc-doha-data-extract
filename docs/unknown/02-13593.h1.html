<P>Applicant is a 50-year-old naturalized citizen of the United States employed by a defense contractor.  His parents, siblings and their spouses are citizens and 
residents of India.  Applicant maintains a bank account in India to facilitate the transfer of funds to his parents for their support and maintenance when the need 
arises. <EM> </EM>Applicant failed to note on his security clearance application his foreign bank account and employment with a foreign company between 1977 and 1978, 
however it was not deliberate.  Considering Applicant's close ties to the United States, including his citizenship, his long-term residency and employment, and 
his financial holdings, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from the foreign residence of his family members and his bank account in a foreign

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Under Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry</EM>, (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM>, (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and modified (the "Directive"), the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On September 16, 2003, DOHA issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.  The SOR alleges security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) of the Directive.</P> 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR in writing on October 13, 2003.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  </P> 
<P>Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on January 8, 2004.  Department Counsel provided a complete copy of the file of relevant 
material (FORM) to Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying 
conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on January 28, 2004, but did not provide additional materials for consideration.  The case was initially assigned to 
another administrative judge but was transferred to me on August 3, 2004.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P>

having any foreign property, business connections, or financial interests<EM>.  Id.</EM> at 4. <EM> </EM>At that time, Applicant had a non-resident account in a bank in India held 
jointly with his father.  Item 6, <EM>supra</EM>, at 3.  There is no evidence whether there were any funds in the account at the time of the statement.</P> 
<P><EM></EM>The SF 86, Security Clearance Application, also included Question 13, inquiring whether Applicant had ever been employed by or acted as a consultant for a 
foreign government, firm, or agency.  Item 5, <EM>supra</EM>, at 4.  Applicant answered "Yes" to this question, and listed employment with a technology firm in England 
between 1987 and 1989.  <EM>Id.</EM>  Applicant was employed with an electronics firm in India for 11 months between 1977 and 1978, but did not report that fact.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>In Executive Order 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM>, &sect; 3.1(b) (August 4, 1995), the President provided that eligibility for access to classified 
information shall be granted only to United States citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength 
of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, 
and willingness and ability to abide by regulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information."  A person granted access to classified 
information enters into a special relationship with the government.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those 
individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant.  Exec. Ord. 10865, &sect; 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for issuing a 
clearance.</P> 
<P>To be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth 
personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  The adjudicative guidelines at issue in 
this case are: </P> 
<P>Guideline B - Foreign Influence:  A security risk may exist when an applicant's immediate family, or other persons to whom he may be bound by affection, 
influence, or obligation, are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that 
could result in the compromise of classified information.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.</P> 
<P>Guideline E - Personal Conduct:  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to 
comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the applicant may not properly safeguard classified information.  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to these adjudicative 
guidelines, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a 
security clearance."  Directive, &para; E2.2.1.  An administrative judge must apply the "whole person concept," and consider and carefully weigh the available, 
reliable information about the person. <EM> Id.</EM>  An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 
(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age 
and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
<EM>Id.</EM>  <BR> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for 
access to classified information.  Directive, &para; E3.1.14.  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts.  Directive, &para; E3.1.15.  An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  "Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent 
with national security will be resolved in favor of the national security."  Directive, &para; E2.2.2. </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above. I reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B, Foreign Influence.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government's documentary matters and Applicant's admissions constitute substantial evidence of several disqualifying conditions under Guideline B of 
the Directive.  Paragraph E2.A2.1.2.1 of the Directive provides that it may be a disqualifying condition if "an immediate family member, or a person to whom 
the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country."  Additionally, &para; E2.A2.1.2.3 provides that it 
may be disqualifying if an applicant has "relatives . . . or associates who are connected to a foreign government."</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's immediate family members, specifically his parents, a brother, and two sisters, reside in India.  Additionally, his brothers-in-law are persons to 
whom Applicant has close ties of affection.  Applicant's contacts with these foreign citizens are regular and significant.  The substantial evidence is sufficient to 
raise security concerns under &para; E2.A2.1.2.1.  These circumstances "could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of 
classified information."  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.1.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While the </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mere possession of family ties with persons in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, automatically disqualifying . . . [it] does raise a prima facie security 
concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant's burden of persuasion that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant <A NAME="7996-34"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or continue a security clearance for the applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 59 at **33-34 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These security concerns can be mitigated where it is determined that the family members or associates in question are not agents of a foreign power, and they 
are not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person involved and the United 
States.  Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3.1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph E2.A2.1.3.1. defines "immediate family members" to include a spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters.  The evidence indicates 
that none of Applicant's immediate family members are agents of a foreign power: his father is retired, his mother and sisters have always been homemakers, 
and his brother owns a farm.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's brother-in-law works for a government organization specializing in civil engineering.  There is no information indicating the brother-in-law's 
position within the organization, thus I am unable to determine he is not an agent of a foreign power under &para; E2.A2.2.1.3.1.  <EM>See</EM> 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1801(b).  
Nonetheless, considering Applicant's lack of regular contact with his brother-in-law, it seems unlikely that Applicant could be exploited by a foreign power 
through this relationship.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In assessing whether relatives are vulnerable to exploitation, a judge should consider several factors, including the character of the government of the relevant 
foreign country.  India is not a hostile country nor are its interests inimical to the United States.  The United States and India are the world's largest 
democracies, and enjoy good relations.  The United States is India's largest trading partner.  Although their have been concerns about nuclear proliferation, the 
United States and India share a common goal of promoting stability in Asia and fighting terrorism.  Of course, <EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">nothing in Guideline B (Foreign Influence) indicates or suggests that it is limited to countries that are hostile to the United States.  The United States has a 
compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, 
regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  Department Counsel submitted Item 8, the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive's 
Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage for 2000.  The report includes a summary of a survey of a dozen Fortune 
500 companies that indicated India is one of the most active collectors of foreign economic information or industrial espionage.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is important to consider the vulnerability to duress of Applicant's relatives in India.  His immediate family members are not government employees or 
annuitants.  His father was self-employed and has now retired.  Similarly, his brother is retired from banking, and owns a farm.   His mother and sisters are 
homemakers.  This lessens the opportunity for adverse influence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Another significant factor is Applicant's vulnerability to duress.  He has extensive ties to the United States, having lived in this country and worked for the 
same defense contractor for about 15 years.  Applicant is an internationally recognized expert on antenna and microwave engineering, especially shaped 
reflector technology used on satellites, and has risen to a level of prominence within the defense contractor's organization.  Applicant's most immediate family 
members are his wife and son, both of whom are naturalized citizens and residents of the United States.  All his financial interests are in the United States, 
except for the single bank account discussed below.  See Directive, &para; E2.A2.1.3.5.  Considering the extent of his ties to the United States, it appears Applicant 
is not unusually vulnerable to duress.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1.f of the SOR also alleges that Applicant maintains a bank account in India for the financial interests of his family members there, and that he 
previously sent about $15,000.00 to the account.  Applicant admitted these facts.  Item 3, <EM>supra</EM>, at 1.  Under &para; E2.A2.1.2.8 of the Directive, it may be a 
disqualifying condition if an applicant holds "A substantial financial interest in a country, or in any foreign-owned or -operated business that could make the 
individual vulnerable to foreign influence."  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only specific evidence about this bank account comes from Applicant.  He explains that he opened the account jointly with his father as a means to safely 
and conveniently transfer funds to his parents for payment of medical bills and other expenses when necessary.  Item 3, <EM>supra</EM>, at 1; Item 6, <EM>supra</EM>, at 3.  
Applicant indicates the account is merely a conduit for funds, not a repository.  Item 3, <EM>supra,</EM> at 1.  Applicant does not maintain funds, make withdrawals, or 
receive bank statements in this account.  Item 3, <EM>supra</EM>, at 1; Item 6, <EM>supra</EM>, at 3.  Significantly, there is no information whether this account held substantial 
funds for any significant period.  Applicant's financial contributions are important factors in assessing the closeness of his relationship with his parents.  
However, the mere existence of a bank account, without any indication of the amount of funds held therein, does not constitute evidence of a "substantial 
financial interest" in a foreign country under &para; E2.A2.1.2.8 of the Directive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I considered all the circumstances in light of the "whole person" concept.  I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his having 
relatives and a bank account in India.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E, Personal Conduct.<EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Under &para; E2.A5.1.2.2 of the Directive, "the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security 
questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness . . . " may be disqualifying.  The SOR alleges 
Applicant deliberately falsified relevant and material facts on his SF 86, Security Clearance Application.  Specifically, the Government alleges Applicant 
falsified information concealing the Indian bank account discussed above, and that he worked for an Indian electronics company between 1977 and 1978.  
Applicant admitted that he failed to include the information on his security clearance application, but contends it was unintentional.  Item 3, <EM>supra,</EM> at 1.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regard to the bank account in India, the specific question on the security clearance application was, "Do you have any foreign property, business 
connections, or financial interests?" Applicant answered, "No."  The question did not specifically inquire about bank accounts.  As discussed above, Applicant 
indicated he used it only as a conduit for funds, and not as a repository.  Applicant indicated he did not list the account on his security clearance application 
because he did not "think of it as a regular account."  Item 6, <EM>supra</EM>, at 3.  It may not be immediately apparent to a reasonable person that a bank account used 
only as a conduit for funds transfers is a "financial interest" requiring reporting. <STRONG><EM> </EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM></EM>I conclude Applicant did not deliberately intend to conceal or falsify the facts 
concerning his Indian bank account.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regard to his employment with an electronics firm in India between 1977 and 1978, Applicant admitted he did not report it on the security clearance 
application, but contends it was an inadvertent omission.  Applicant submitted copies of his application for employment with his current employer dated 1988, 
his resume, and his application for selection for senior technical fellow dated 2001.  Item 3, <EM>supra</EM>.  Each document reflected his employment with the 
electronics firm between 1977 and 1978.  Considering that Applicant was employed there for less than one year, that the employment was over 20 years prior to 
his completion of the security clearance application, and Applicant's previous reports of the position to his current employer, I conclude his omission on the 
security clearance application was inadvertent.<STRONG><EM>  </EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Thus, I find Applicant did not deliberately omit or falsify relevant or material facts concerning his previous 
employment on the security clearance application.<STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG></SPAN></P>
