<P>The Applicant used marijuana on a daily basis from 1972~1978.  In 1979, he started to use both LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms.  He used these drugs, 3~4 
times each, until their last usage in 1984.  He was subsequently granted a security clearance in 1986.  In 1979, the Applicant also started to use cocaine.  He 
used cocaine on a nearly monthly basis until his last usage in 1991.  After 1979, the Applicant also continued to use marijuana on a less frequent basis.  From 
1994 until his last usage in April of 2001, the Applicant used marijuana on an annual basis.  His last drug abuse was more than two years ago, and he intends no 
future abuse.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 14, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on or about March 20, 2003.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on May 23, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 25, 2003, and the case was heard on July 9, 2003.  The 
Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who submitted documentary evidence, and called one witness to 
testify on his behalf.  The transcript was received on July 17, 2003.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's admitted past drug involvement militates 
against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the underlying factual basis of the allegations, but denies any future drug abuse.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is</SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">46 years of age, has a 
master's degree in electrical engineering, and is employed by a defense contractor that seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant</SPAN>.  After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline H - Drug Involvement</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>1.a.~1.i.  The Applicant used marijuana on a daily basis from 1972~1978 (Transcript (TR) at page 25 line 12 to page 26 line 24, at page 34 line 21 to page 35 
line 8, and at page 36 lines 5~10, <EM>see also</EM> TR at page 45 line 2 to page 52 line 6).  In 1979, he started to use both LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms (TR at 
page 29 line 2 to page 30 line 6, <EM>see also</EM> TR at page 45 line 2 to page 52 line 6).  He used these drugs, 3~4 times each, until his last usage of these two drugs in 
1984 (<EM>id</EM>).  He was subsequently granted a security clearance in 1986 (Government Exhibit (GX) 2 at page 4).  In 1979, the Applicant also started to use cocaine 
(TR at page 28 lines 13~21, at page 31 line 15 to page 33 line 3, and<EM> </EM>at page 54 line 12 to page 55 line 6,<EM> see also</EM> TR at page 45 line 2 to page 52 line 6).  He 
purchased the drug for his own use until about 1984, and he used cocaine on a nearly monthly basis until his last usage in 1991 (<EM>id</EM>).  After 1979, the Applicant 
also continued to use marijuana on a less frequent basis (TR at page 25 line 12 to page 26 line 24, at page 34 line 21 to page 35 line 8, and at page 36 lines 
5~10, <EM>see also</EM> TR at page 45 line 2 to page 52 line 6).  He last purchased the drug in 1991; and from 1994 until his last usage in April of 2001, the Applicant 
only used marijuana on an annual basis (<EM>id</EM>).  His last drug abuse was more than two years ago, and he intends no future abuse (TR at page 24 lines 12~21).</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant avers credibly that he has no intention of using any illegal drugs in the future (<EM>id</EM>).  He avers that his "life had changed" in 2001.  He testified, in 
part, as follows:</P> 
 
<P>. . . 2001 was when my wife's kidneys failed.  I was trying to move to . . . [a named U.S. city] and get a new job there. . . . [Y]ou find there is no room for that 
[drug involvement] in your life anymore and it is just too much to risk.  And I can't afford to do things whether they be - - because even the fact of the security 
aspect of it - - or illegal, whatever.  I just - - the risk of jeopardizing my family an ability to earn a living, I think was one factor that kind of - - and you just 
change.  That's not you anymore (TR at page 51 lines 4~16).</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's occasional marijuana use, occurring during the last seven years of his drug involvement ending in 2001, does not bring him within the purview 
of 10 U.S.C. Section 986, as he is no longer a user and has not used in more than two years.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Two of the Applicant's co-workers speaks highly of the Applicant and aver that he is trustworthy (TR at page 58 line 22 to page 64 line 22, and Applicant's 
Exhibit (AppX) B at page 1, <EM>see also</EM> AppX A).  His spouse also speaks credibly to the Applicant's commitment to no future drug abuse (AppX B at page 2, <EM>see 
also</EM> TR at page 33 lines 9~16).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be 
given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions should be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion, 
however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his 
own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these conditions 
exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Drug Involvement</SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>a. Any drug abuse (drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction);</P> 
 
<P>b. Illegal drug . . . purchase . . .</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns</SPAN>:</P> 
 
<P>a. The drug involvement was not recent;</P> 
 
<P>c. A demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future.</P> 
 
<P>As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</P> 
 
<P>a. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.</P> 
 
<P>b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</P> 
 
<P>c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</P> 
 
<P>d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</P> 
 
<P>e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</P> 
 
<P>f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future."</P> 
 
<P>The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</P> 
 
<P>The Government must make out its case under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</P> 
 
<P>Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</P> 
 
<P>The improper or illegal involvement with drugs, raises questions regarding an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  The 
Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all 
places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the law in his private affairs, there then exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the 
same attitude towards security rules and regulations.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>The Applicant used a number of drugs spanning a period of nearly 30 years.  This past drug abuse is of concern to the Government, but the gravamen of the 
Government's case is his most recent abuse, that of marijuana.  [His other drug involvement having occurred more then a decade ago.]  From 1991 until his last 
usage in April of 2001, the Applicant's only drug involvement was with marijuana, and then only on an occasional basis.  His last occasional use of the drug 
occurred more than two years ago; and, in light of his greatly diminished drug involvement since 1991, is not recent, thus satisfying the first mitigating 
condition under Drug Involvement.  He has also avers credibly that since 1991, his family life has changed significantly; and as such, drug involvement has no 
place in his life anymore.  Furthermore, his testimony is corroborated by his spouse and by two co-workers, that he intends no future drug involvement.  This 
satisfies the third mitigating condition.  I therefore find that the Applicant's past drug abuse is not of present security significance.  Guideline H is therefore 
found for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his drug involvement.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating 
conditions of Guideline H, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline H.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER>
