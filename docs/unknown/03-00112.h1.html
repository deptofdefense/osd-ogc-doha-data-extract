<P>In 1980, Applicant pled guilty to two charges of embezzling mail matter by a postal employee based on his stealing several hundred dollars from letters he 
handled as a postal employee. The federal district court sentenced Applicant to confinement for three years, of which all but 60 days was suspended and he was 
placed on probation. He has since been a law-abiding citizen and continuously employed by defense contractors. He has held a security clearance without an 
adverse incident or problem since approximately 1981. Under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, the Defense Department is prohibited from granting or renewing Applicant's 
security clearance based on his sentence to confinement exceeding one year unless the prohibition is waived by the Secretary of Defense; a waiver is not 
recommended. Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On July 31, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating the reasons why DOHA 
proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></SPAN> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges a security 
concern under Guideline J for criminal conduct. In particular, the SOR alleges a security concern based on Applicant's 1980 criminal conviction in federal court 
on the charges of embezzlement of mail matter by a postal employee resulting in a sentence to confinement for three years. The SOR also alleges that Applicant 
is ineligible for access to classified information under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986--the so-called Smith Amendment--based on his sentence to confinement exceeding one 
year.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant answered the SOR on August 15, 2003, and he requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record. In his answer, Applicant admitted to the 
factual allegation in SOR subparagraph 1.a. </P> 
 
<P>On September 16, 2003, the case was initially assigned to another administrative judge. Applicant's counsel entered his appearance on or about September 22, 
2003. Thereafter, on September 30, a notice of hearing was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for Monday, October 27, 2003. Due to case load 
considerations, the case was reassigned to me October 7 and subsequently, I cancelled the schedule hearing due to a serious medical problem experienced by 
Applicant. On October 31, 2003, a notice of hearing was issued to the parties scheduling the hearing for Tuesday, December 2, 2003. Applicant appeared with 
counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. </P> 
 
<P>DOHA received the hearing transcript December 11, 2003. Subsequently, it was discovered that the transcript was incorrectly prepared and a second transcript 
was received January 23, 2004. This second transcript was missing pages 139 - 152. DOHA received the third and final transcript with the missing pages on 
February 4, 2004. </P> 
 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>RULINGS ON PROCEDURE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>By his counsel (Appellate Exhibit 1), Applicant requests that the processing of this case be held in abeyance in light of recent congressional action directing the 
Secretary of Defense to make an assessment of the Smith Amendment and report back to Congress within 60 days of enactment.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Congress has directed the 
Secretary to review the effects of the four disqualifying grounds of the Smith Amendment and make such recommendations for legislative or administrative 
steps as deemed necessary by the Secretary. Department Counsel opposed the request for various reasons as set forth in his written reply (Appellate Exhibit 2). 
As an administrative judge, my authority is derived from an applicable federal statute, executive order, or federal regulation. I am aware of nothing in an 
applicable federal statute, Executive Order 10865, or the Directive that allows an administrative judge to hold in abeyance or suspend the processing of a 
security clearance case for any reason.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Lacking such authority, Applicant's request is denied without addressing the merits. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions are incorporated into my findings, and after a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and  exhibits, I make the following essential 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 54-year-old married man seeking to retain a secret security clearance first granted to him in approximately 1981. He currently works as a network 
administrator for a defense contractor in support of the U.S. Navy. He has worked for this company since 1993. Previously, he was unemployed during 1993 
until he accepted his current position on December 8, 1993. He worked for a defense contractor from June 1981 until January 1993. From 1980 to June 1981, 
Applicant worked for another defense contractor. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">His first marriage in 1969 ended in divorce in 1974. He remarried the same year and that marriage ended in divorce in 1987. He married his third and current 
spouse in July 1994. His wife, who testified during the hearing, works as deputy director and accountant for a trade association. Applicant has no children.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1968 and served from November 1968 until April 1973. He was honorably discharged at the pay grade of E-5.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Upon his discharge, Applicant applied to work for the U.S. Postal Service. Applicant was hired and worked for the postal service from 1973 until January 1980. 
In 1979, Applicant operated a letter-sorting machine, and he was responsible for training new employees how to operate the machine. In addition, Applicant 
was required to hand sort mail.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">While hand sorting mail addressed to a zip code belonging to a certain religion-based broadcasting network, some money fell out of an envelope and Applicant 
decided to keep it. He knew that envelopes addressed to the same zip code often contained money. He also knew the monies were donations to the organization 
given by various individuals. Tempted, Applicant took some of the letters containing money. He did so two to three times weekly for five or six weeks or so. He 
estimates stealing several hundred dollars, but less than $1,000. Applicant was not experiencing financial problems during this time. He used the money to buy 
automotive tools and to pay for events he attended as a member of a corvette club. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was caught when he was observed by postal inspectors. When he was arrested on or about October 15, 1979, the then 30-year-old Applicant 
possessed 18 envelopes containing about $200. The postal service  immediately suspended Applicant from work and he was allowed to resign in January 1980.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In November 1979, a federal grand jury charged Applicant with ten counts of embezzlement of mail matter by a postal employee in violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 
1709. On January 22, 1980, Applicant appeared with counsel in federal court and pled guilty to counts 1 and 2 of the indictment. On the first count, the court 
sentenced Applicant to confinement for three years. The court suspended the confinement, except for 60 days, and placed him on probation for three years. 
Concerning the second count, the court suspended imposing the sentence and placed him on probation for three years to run concurrent with the probation term 
on count 1. The court dismissed the remaining counts (3 - 10). The court did not order Applicant to make restitution of the monies he stole, and he has not done 
so on his own initiative. Applicant's term of confinement began January 28, 1980.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant served the 60-days confinement in a local jail. His probation started when he was  released on or about March 28, 1980. He completed probation 
successfully. Indeed, his probation was terminated early in December 1981. Since completing his probation, Applicant has not been involved in additional 
criminal conduct and he appears by all accounts to be a law-abiding citizen. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">For example, he now regularly participates in his community's neighborhood-watch program.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Shortly after his release, Applicant found employment with a defense contractor. In conjunction with his employment, Applicant was required to apply for a 
security clearance. In February 1981, he was interviewed during the background investigation. Sometime thereafter, the Defense Department granted Applicant 
a security clearance. He has since held that security clearance without an adverse incident or problem.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> Aside from being unemployed during most of 1993, Applicant has been continuously employed since his release from confinement in 1980. Applicant is a 
loyal, reliable, and productive employee with a solid reputation among his Navy customers. Applicant presented favorable character evidence via the testimony 
of several witnesses and numerous exhibits (Exhibits A - K). In sum, Applicant is known as an honest person of high moral character; a person with sound 
judgment; a responsible, trustworthy, meticulous, competent, and intelligent person; and a team-player with an outstanding work ethic. By all appearances, 
since his 1980 felony conviction, Applicant has led an upstanding life.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is remorseful and very much regrets his actions believing he let down many people. He believes he has matured greatly since he committed the  
offenses in 1979. And he also believes he will not engage in any sort of behavior that will jeopardize his eligibility to hold a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security-clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on 
the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1. through &para; 6.3.6. of the Directive. Although the 
presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline J for criminal conduct</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> is most relevant here.

</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The U.S. Supreme Court has said the burden of proof  in a security-clearance case 
is less than the preponderance of the evidence.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court's reasoning on this issue establishing a substantial-evidence 
standard.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> "Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> Once the government meets its burden</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">, an applicant

ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Court in <EM>Egan</EM>, "it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that 
security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> Under </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any reasonable

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline J, criminal conduct is a security concern because a history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. A history of illegal behavior indicates an individual may be inclined to break, disregard, or fail to comply with </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">regulations, practices, or 
procedures</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> concerning safeguarding and handling classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition to Guideline J, under an applicable federal statute, the Defense Department and the military departments may not grant or renew a security clearance 
for any DoD officer or employee, an employee, officer, or director of a DoD contractor, or a member of the armed forces on active duty or in an active status 
who falls under any of four statutory categories.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></SPAN> The statutory category at issue here is &sect; 986(c)(1), which provides: "The person has been convicted in any 
court of the United States of a crime and sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year." The statute also provides that the Secretary of Defense or 
the secretary of the relevant military department may, in a meritorious case, authorize an exception to the statutory prohibition for persons in two of the four 
statutory categories; namely, paragraphs (1) and (4) of &sect; 986&copy;). The statute does not define, explain, or describe a "meritorious" case.</P> 
 
<P>In June 2001, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued official policy guidance designed to assist the DoD and military departments in uniformly implementing 
10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Concerning criminal convictions, the policy guidance is the statute disqualifies persons with convictions in both state and federal courts, 
including military courts, with sentences imposed for more than one year regardless of the amount of time actually served. Like the statute, the policy guidance 
does not define, explain, or describe a "meritorious" case.</P> 
 
<P>Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government has established its case under Guideline J. Applicant's criminal conduct in 1979 and the 1980 
federal felony conviction are evidence of a history or pattern of illegal behavior that creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Given 
these circumstances, DC 1<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> and DC 2<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> apply. The record evidence shows Applicant--while working as a postal service employee--embezzled mail to 
enrich himself. His criminal conduct is considered serious because: (1) Applicant knew he was taking mail addressed to a religion-based broadcasting network; 
(2) Applicant knew the monies in the letters were donations intended for that organization; and (3) Applicant violated the special trust placed in him as a postal 
employee to properly handle and safeguard mail under his control. Moreover, when he committed these multiple offenses, Applicant was a 30-year-old married 
man and an honorably discharged Navy veteran. In other words, his actions were not that of an immature, youthful offender, as he plainly knew or should have 
known better. It's difficult to understand why the Defense Department granted Applicant a security clearance in 1981 given the seriousness and recency of his 
criminal conduct. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the normal security concerns under Guideline J, Applicant's 1980 conviction and three-year sentence, adjudged by a federal court, falls within the 
scope of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Accordingly, absent a waiver by the Secretary of Defense, Applicant is ineligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline J and two apply in  Applicant's favor. First, the offenses took place in 1979, and so, the criminal 
behavior is not recent.<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN> Second,  Applicant has reformed and rehabilitated<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN> himself since his release from incarceration. His reform and rehabilitation is 
demonstrated by: (1) his early completion of court-ordered probation; (2) his steady and productive employment since 1980 with defense contractors; (3) 
holding a security clearance without an adverse incident or problem since approximately 1981; and (4) conducting himself as a law-abiding citizen since his 
release from confinement. The remaining mitigating conditions do not apply given the facts and circumstances here. In particular, Applicant's criminal conduct 
is not considered an isolated incident<A HREF="03-00112.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A> because he committed multiple offenses over a period of several weeks.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">To sum up under Guideline J, the record evidence shows Applicant engaged in serious criminal conduct as a 30-year-old man in 1979 when he abused his 
position as a postal employee by embezzling mail to enrich himself. Nearly 25 years have since passed without recurrence, and I assess the likelihood of 
additional criminal conduct as low to remote. Nevertheless, given the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">prohibition of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, I decide this case against Applicant. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">In reaching my 
decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, as well as the whole-person concept and other appropriate factors and 
guidelines in the Directive. </SPAN></P>
