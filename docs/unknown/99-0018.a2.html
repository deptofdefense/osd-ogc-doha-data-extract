<P>Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola issued a remand decision, dated December 20, 1999, in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Department Counsel appealed.  For the reasons set forth below, the Board reverses the
Administrative Judge's remand decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as
amended.</P>

<P>Department Counsel's appeal presents the following issues: (1) whether the Administrative Judge abused his discretion by refusing to consider a brief on remand
proffered by Department Counsel; (2) whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2; (3) whether the
Administrative Judge erred by applying  Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1; (4) whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Criminal Conduct
itigating Condition 5;  and (5) whether the Administrative Judge's overall decision was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated January 8, 1999 to Applicant.  The SOR was based on Criterion J
(Criminal Conduct) and Criterion D (Sexual Behavior).  The SOR alleged that Applicant engaged in acts of sexual molestation with several female victims (who
were minors) at various times in 1997.  It also alleged that Applicant pled guilty to one count of lewdness involving a child in a state court, was placed on
probation, violated his probation by committing an additional act of sexual molestation and had his probation revoked and subsequently reinstated.</P>

<P>Applicant elected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.  The Administrative Judge issued a written decision, dated August 9,
1999, in which he concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Department Counsel
appealed the favorable decision.</P>

<P>On December 6, 1999, the Board issued its Appeal Board Decision and Remand Order (hereinafter "Remand Order").  In that decision, the Board held: (1) the
Judge's conclusory citation of Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition1<A HREF="99-0018.a2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> and Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2<A HREF="99-0018.a2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> did not provide the parties and the
Board with a basis to conclude whether the Judge engaged in reasoned decision-making; (2) the Judge's failure to discuss his reasoning as to the significance of
Applicant's 1997 probation violation when applying Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5<A HREF="99-0018.a2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> left the Board unable to discern whether the Judge engaged in
reasoned decision-making when deciding this part of the case; and (3) the Judge's brief, cursory discussion in the Conclusions section of the decision below left
the Board unable to discern whether the Judge weighed the record evidence as a whole in a reasonable, common sense manner.  The Board remanded the case to
the Judge with instructions to correct the errors identified by the Board and to weigh a letter authored by a clinician in light of the record evidence as a whole,
including Applicant's probationary status and Applicant's probation violation.</P>

<P>Following the issuance of the Board's Remand Order, Department Counsel on its own initiative submitted a "Brief on Remand" to the Administrative Judge on
December 8, 1999.  In the Brief on Remand, Department Counsel provided arguments highlighting the reasons the Judge should not give the report of
Applicant's clinician much weight in his remand decision.  In response to this submission the Administrative Judge issued a show cause order, also dated
December 8, 1999 in which stated, "Department Counsel must show good cause why I should <STRONG>now</STRONG> (emphasis in original) consider this argument, as the
Government had ample opportunity to posit such an argument when the case was first before me."  Department Counsel responded to the show cause order on
December 15, 1999.  Copies of the Show Cause Order and Department Counsel's response were provided to the Applicant, but no response was ever solicited
from the Applicant.  </P>

<P>The Administrative Judge issued a new decision, dated December 20, 1999 (hereinafter "Remand Decision").  In the Remand Decision the Judge related that he
considered the Government's response to his Show Cause Order and found that it failed to show good cause.  In the Remand Decision, the Administrative Judge
found that: (a) a period of more than two years is a sufficient passage of time to conclude the Applicant's past criminal and sexual behavior is not recent; (b)
there was no evidence of subsequent criminal sexual behavior during the intervening two plus years; (c) there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation; (d)
the two-page report of Applicant's clinician states uncategorically that Applicant has successfully rehabilitated himself and there is absolutely no evidence to the
contrary; (e) notwithstanding the fact that Applicant violated the terms of his original probation and was again placed on probation, based on the totality of the
record evidence and applying the whole person concept, there is unrebutted evidence that Applicant has successfully rehabilitated himself; and (f) Applicant's
inappropriate sexual behavior and related criminal conduct are distant enough in the past as not to be of present security significance.  The Judge made formal
findings for Applicant under Criteria D and J, and concluded it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant.</P>

<P>The case is before the Board on Department Counsel's appeal from the Administrative Judge's Remand Decision.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge abused his discretion by refusing to consider Department Counsel's Brief on Remand.</SPAN>  Department Counsel offers a
number of reasons why the Administrative Judge should have considered their Brief on Remand.  It states that: (a) nothing in the Board's December 6, 1999
decision stated that Department Counsel was prohibited from making arguments on remand and the Board's decision seemed to encourage asserting the
arguments on remand; (b) the arguments provide legitimate reasons why the Judge should have given the clinician's letter less weight; (c) the arguments are
based on existing record evidence and should have surprised neither Judge nor Applicant; and (d) consideration of the arguments would not result in undue
delay of the case.</P>

<P>Absent issues affecting due process rights of the parties, the Board does not act as a general arbiter of the processing of the cases on remand.  There would have
been absolutely no reason for the Board to prohibit either party from submitting arguments to the Judge after the issuance of the Remand Order.  Therefore, the
absence of such a prohibition is of no consequence.  Department Counsel misconstrues the language of the Remand Order by suggesting that it contains an
implied invitation to file a Brief on Remand.  </P>

<P>Department Counsel's second and third arguments are centered around assertions of the substantive merits of the arguments made in the Brief on Remand.  The
issue it brings before the Board now calls into question the Judge's discretion on a purely procedural matter.  The substantive merits of the arguments
Department Counsel wished the Judge to consider are irrelevant to a consideration of whether the Judge abused his discretion on a matter of procedure.</P>

<P>The mere fact that consideration of the arguments would have caused no undue delay in the processing of the case fails to establish that the Judge abused his
discretion.  The Administrative Judge is entitled to consider a number of factors when making a decision about a request such as this one, including the timing
of the request, the nature of the request, and the extent to which the moving party had an earlier opportunity to proffer the arguments.  It appears that the
Administrative Judge had some of these factors in mind when he refused to consider the arguments.  He did not abuse his discretion by doing so.</P>

<P>The Directive is silent on this issue.  Nothing prevents an Administrative Judge from considering a Brief on Remand such as the one proffered by Department
Counsel so long as there is notice to the opposing party and an opportunity to respond.  By the same token, there is no requirement that the Judge consider the
arguments.  Department Counsel has failed to establish that the Judge abused his discretion.  </P>

<P>Some comment about the Judge's use of the show cause order is appropriate since Department Counsel called it into question in its argument.  The
Administrative Judge was not required to use a show cause order to resolve the issue of Department Counsel's Brief on Remand.  However, once the order
issued, the Judge was obligated out of a duty of fairness to the parties to allow comment by the opposing party and to specifically respond to the input provided
by the parties.  However, the Judge's handling of the show cause order, while clearly perfunctory and arguably arbitrary and capricious, does not mean that the
Judge's overall resolution of this issue was an abuse of discretion. </P>

<P>  2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2.</SPAN><A HREF="99-0018.a2.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Department Counsel contends that, given the record
evidence in this case, it was improper for the Judge to apply Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2.  Department Counsel's argument has merit.</P>

<P>The Board has declined to furnish "bright-line" guidance regarding the concept of recency.  The conclusion of the Judge that conduct of security significance
was  not recent must be evaluated through careful consideration of the totality of the specific record at hand.  In this case, the last incident of sexual molestation
took place a little over two years before the close of the record.  That interval of time must be evaluated in light of other significant factors in the case, namely:
(a) the fact that Applicant has been on criminal court-ordered probation for the entire time interval; (b) the fact that Applicant engaged in acts of sexual
molestation repeatedly over a time span of approximately six months; and (c) the fact that Applicant violated his probation by engaging in another act of sexual
molestation after his criminal conviction.  Given the totality of the circumstances, on this record it was not reasonable for the Judge to conclude that the conduct
was not recent.</P>

<P>The second portion of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2 speaks to the lack of evidence of subsequent misconduct of a similar nature.  Department
Counsel's argument on this point hints at an interpretation of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2 that would make its application appropriate only in
instances of isolated conduct.  The Board need not adopt such an interpretation to reach the conclusion that the Administrative Judge's application of the
itigating Condition was inappropriate in this case.  After being placed on criminal probation for certain repeated sexual misconduct, the Applicant
subsequently engaged in exactly the same type misconduct.  Given these facts, the Judge's application of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2 does not
reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.</P>

<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1.</SPAN>  This particular mitigating condition deals with the concept of
recency alone.  The Board's ruling above with regard to the "recency" prong of Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2 applies with equal force to the Judge's
application of this Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition.</P>

<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge erred by applying Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5</SPAN>.  Department Counsel argues that the record evidence does not
support the Judge's conclusion that there is clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Department Counsel's argument here centers around the notion that the
Judge gave too much weight to the clinician's report wherein the clinician concluded that Applicant was completely rehabilitated.  Department Counsel's
specific arguments regarding the Judge's consideration of the report are: (a) the report is not signed by a licensed physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or
board certified psychiatrist; (b) there was no opportunity to cross-examine the author of the report; (c) the author of the report erroneously made statements
about applicant's security clearance eligibility; (d) the report appears to have been prepared in anticipation of litigation; and (e) the report is not binding or
conclusive simply because it is unrebutted.  Department Counsel's contentions have mixed merit.</P>

<P>Department Counsel complains first about the fact that the signatory of the report is not a  licensed physician, licensed clinical psychologist, or board-certified
psychiatrist.  The Board notes that Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5 includes no requirement that the evidence of successful rehabilitation come from
any specific professional source.  While an evaluation of successful rehabilitation may be weighed more heavily or  more lightly depending on the source of that
evaluation, the Board does not accept the notion that the clinician's report is entitled to little or no weight simply because it is not signed by a member of the
professional categories enumerated by Department Counsel.</P>

<P>Department Counsel is in a problematic position regarding its argument that the absence of its ability to cross-examine the author of the report reduces the
amount of weight that may be properly assigned to it.  Notwithstanding the fact that this case was decided on a written record rather than a hearing, Department
Counsel still had an opportunity to object to Applicant's proffer of the clinician's letter.  Having decided not to do so, they have little room on appeal to argue
that the lack of ability to cross-examine should materially affect the weight to be given the document.</P>

<P>The clinician's statements regarding Applicant's security clearance eligibility were not statements made within the clinician's field of expertise and thus were not
proper for the Judge's consideration.  There is nothing in the Judge's decision however to indicate that the clinician's comments along these lines were a factor in
the Judge's ultimate conclusion.  The Board will not presume error below.  Absent an express indication that the Judge was swayed by the clinician's comments
regarding Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance, the Board will not conclude that the Judge gave too much weight to the document on that basis.</P>

<P>Department Counsel correctly points out that the clinician's letter appears to have been prepared in anticipation of litigation.  This would properly lessen the
amount of weight to be ascribed to the document, but this factor alone would not mandate that the Judge assign little or no weight to the document.</P>

<P>Department Counsel asserts that the clinician's report is not binding or conclusive solely because it is unrebutted.  It states that the Judge must consider the
report along with the evidence as a whole.  Department Counsel's contention has merit.</P>

<P>There is record evidence that significantly detracts from the conclusions espoused in the clinician's report.  It was arbitrary and capricious for the Judge to
characterize the report as unrebutted when there is other record evidence, such as the pattern of criminal activity, the violation of probation for the same type of
activity, and the continued probationary status, that call the contents of the report into serious question.  Similarly, given the totality of the countervailing
evidence, it was improper for the Judge to give "much weight" to the clinician's report.  This is especially true considering the Judge's failure to explain how he
evaluated the report in light of Applicant's history, failed probation and continued probationary status.</P>

<P>Regarding the Judge's failure to analyze the clinician's report with specific reference to the fact that Applicant was placed on probation and then violated his
probation, his Remand Decision does not comply with the portion of the Remand Order where the Board directed  that "the Judge should explain how he weighs
the clinician's letter in light of the record evidence as a whole, including Applicant's probationary status and Applicant's probation violation."<A HREF="99-0018.a2.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  It is arbitrary,
capricious and contrary to law for a Judge to fail to comply with the law of the case on remand.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0184 (December 8, 1998) at p. 7.</P>

<P>Viewing the record evidence in its totality, it was error for the Administrative Judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 5, as Applicant has failed
to produce clear evidence of successful rehabilitation.  Department Counsel persuasively argues that evidence of Applicant's placement on supervised probation
and the subsequent violation of that probation undercuts any conclusion that there is such clear evidence.  The record evidence does not support the Judge's
assertion that the clinician's report establishes "Applicant has successfully rehabilitated himself . . . . [and] there is absolutely no evidence to the contrary."</P>

<P>5. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's Remand Decision was arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law</SPAN>.  Department Counsel also argues that the Remand
Decision of the Administrative  Judge is arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law.  This contention is, in large part, a variation of the  arguments it made
regarding the Judge's erroneous application of the various mitigating conditions in the case.  Specifically, Department Counsel argues: (a) Applicant's pattern of
behavior shows that sexual misconduct has become part of his lifestyle; (b) involvement with law enforcement raises doubts about Applicant's judgment; (c) his 
repetitive conduct shows that he will strike again if given the opportunity; (d) he repeated his illegal conduct while on probation; (e) Applicant may have
exhibited some reform, but he has not established long-term successful reform; and (f) the unwillingness of the state court to trust Applicant around minor
females creates doubt about his security suitability.</P>

<P>Department Counsel's first and third arguments overstate the case against Applicant.  Characterizations such as "has become part of his lifestyle" and "he will
strike again if given the opportunity"  connote  a deeply entrenched pattern of behavior that is not established on this record.  However, it should be noted that
proof of such an entrenched pattern is not necessary to raise serious concerns about Applicant's security clearance eligibility.  Regarding Department Counsel's
second argument, involvement with law enforcement obviously raises some doubt as to an Applicant's security eligibility, but this factor alone is rarely
dispositive of a case.  Department Counsel's sixth argument regarding the state court's unwillingness to trust Applicant around minor females is worthy of some
consideration.  Of course, this unwillingness presumably lasts as long as the probation lasts.  To the extent that this argument suggests or implies that the
imposition of conditions of probation upon Applicant should be a <EM>per</EM> <EM>se</EM> bar to the granting of a security clearance, the Board rejects it.   </P>

<P>Department Counsel's fourth and fifth arguments carry greater weight than the others.  As indicated in Section 4 of this decision above, the fact that Applicant
engaged in an act of sexual molestation while on probation significantly undercuts any conclusion that he has been successfully rehabilitated.  The passage of
time since the most recent violation may  well indicate some progress toward reform, but the totality of the record evidence, including the fact that Applicant
has not concluded his probation and then gone successfully beyond it renders premature any conclusion of long-term rehabilitation.</P>

<P>An Administrative Judge's decision can be arbitrary, capricious if: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion. The Judge's Remand Decision in this case is arbitrary and capricious because it: (1) does
not comply with the law of the case as set forth in the Board's Remand Order; (2) offers explanations for the decision that run contrary to the weight of the
record evidence; and (3) does not reflect a common sense decision within the meaning of Section F.3. of the Directive.</P>

<P><CENTER><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></CENTER>
</P>

<P>Department Counsel has met its burden of demonstrating errors that warrant reversal. Pursuant to Item 33.c. of the Directive's Additional Procedural Guidance,
the Board reverses the Administrative Judge's December 20, 1999 Remand Decision.</P>

<P>I concur with the lead opinion's statement of the procedural history and the issues raised on appeal.  I also concur with the lead opinion's discussion and
resolution of the appeal issues concerning: (a) Sexual Behavior Mitigating Condition 2; (b) Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1; and (c) Criminal Conduct
itigating Condition 5.</P>

<P>I agree with the lead opinion's rejection of Department Counsel's argument that the Board's December 6, 1999 Decision and Remand Order contained an
implied suggestion to file a brief on remand.  Department Counsel's attempt to infer subtle messages from the Board by reading between the lines of a Board
decision is misplaced.  However, I disagree with the lead opinion's conclusion that the Administrative Judge did not err by refusing to consider Department
Counsel's brief on remand.  It was not unreasonable for Department Counsel to submit a brief for consideration by the Judge in connection with an evidentiary
issue that was specifically remanded to the Judge.<A HREF="99-0018.a2.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Considering the procedural posture of the case on remand, the Judge's perfunctory and back-handed
reaction to Department Counsel's brief was arbitrary and capricious.</P>

<P>I agree with the lead opinion's conclusion that the Administrative Judge's December 20, 1999 Remand Decision should be reversed.  Given the record evidence
of Applicant's history of sexual misconduct, Applicant had a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant or continue a security clearance for him.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item 15.  The Judge's Remand Decision fails to articulate a
sustainable basis for concluding that Applicant met that heavy burden of persuasion.  Even reading the record evidence in a light most favorable to Applicant,
the evidence of reform and rehabilitation is mixed and not sufficiently strong to satisfy the "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard that must be
applied.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0821 (October 15, 1998) at p. 3 (presence of some evidence of rehabilitation not enough to warrant a favorable security
clearance decision).  Without a sustainable basis for the Judge's favorable conclusions, the negative security implications of Applicant's history of sexual
misconduct mandate an unfavorable security clearance decision.</P>
