<P>Applicant's history of marijuana use has been mitigated by her expressed and demonstrated commitment to a drug free lifestyle.  Clearance is granted. </P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On October 15, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and 
recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on November 5, 2003, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned 
to the undersigned on January 27, 2004.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 4, 2004, scheduling the hearing for March 4, 2004.  At the hearing the 
Government presented two exhibits.  The Applicant presented thirteen exhibits and testified on her own behalf.   The official transcript (Tr.) was received on 
arch 23, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant is 26 years old, single and holds a bachelors degree in Material Science and Engineering and a Masters Degree in Aerospace Engineering.  She is 
employed by a defense contractor as a Power Systems Engineer, and is seeking to retain her security clearance in connection with her employment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  
The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement)</SPAN>.  The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has abused illegal 
substances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant began using marijuana in 1994 at the young age of sixteen.  She used it on an average of three times a year, usually at social events, mainly 
during college, until June 2002.  She has not used it since June 2002, and she has no intention of ever using it in the future.  She has never purchased, sold or 
possessed it beyond her use at a social event when offered to her.  For the last two years, the Applicant has lived with her fianc&eacute; who expresses a strong position 
against the use of any illegal drugs.  They plan to be married in November of this year.  The Applicant no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs.  
(Tr. pp. 33-36).  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant admits to having used marijuana once or twice after becoming employed with a defense contractor.  She attributes this use of marijuana to her 
immaturity at the time.  After filling out the security clearance application in April 2003, she made the commitment never to use any illegal drugs again.  This 
commitment was not difficult for her because marijuana use was never important to her.  (Tr. p. 24).  She fully understands that DoD policy prohibits the use of 
illegal drugs and that it is against the law.  She also understands the significance and responsibilities that come with holding a security clearance.  I conclude she 
has matured and learned from her mistakes.  She plans to get married soon and no longer associates with illegal drugs or anyone who uses them.        </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN>.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Letters of recommendation from the Applicant's department manager and other professional colleagues with whom she has worked indicate that the Applicant 
is extremely responsible, reliable and trustworthy.  She is described as a very focused, intense individual with the highest integrity and morals.  She has always 
accomplished her job commitments in a timely manner and with the highest quality.  She is clearly dedicated to performing her job with the utmost 
professionalism.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibits A, B,  E and L).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's performance evaluation for 2003 exceeds expectations in almost every category.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibit F).  Applicant's performance objectives 
for 2001 and 2002 indicate that her performance consistently met all job requirements and exceeds expectations in multiple areas.  It further states that she is 
"often innovative, plans for and accomplishes worthwhile objectives whether self-initiated or established by others".  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's Exhibits H and I).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Affidavits from the Applicant's fianc&eacute; and her sister indicate that the Applicant has put her infrequent drug use behind her.  She has made it clear to them that 
she never intends to use marijuana in the future, and that she will not ever be put in a situation where marijuana is used in her presence.  (<EM>See</EM> Applicant's 
Exhibit C and D).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into "Disqualifying Factors" and "Mitigating Factors."  The following 
Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>Guideline H (Drug Involvement)</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1. any drug abuse;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">2. illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate a security concern</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  the drug involvement was not recent;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the Administrative Judge should 
consider the following general factors:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  c.  The frequency and recency of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d.  The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e.  The voluntariness of participation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">g.  The motivation for the conduct </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">h. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">i.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, 
posed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is "clearly consistent with the national interest" to grant an Applicant's request for access to 
classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The DoD Directive states, "The adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the 
person is an acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security 
guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination." The Administrative Judge can draw only those 
inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence 
which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, "Any determination under this order . 
. . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned."</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive 
information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates that 
an Applicant for clearance may be involved in drug use that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct 
and the continued holding of a security clearance.  If such a<EM> </EM>case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in 
rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion 
in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has  engaged in illegal drugs use(Guideline H).  This evidence indicates 
poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is 
a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the 
Government's case under Guideline H of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's marijuana use occurred between 1994 and 2002, over an eight year period.  During this period she abused marijuana at most, about three times 
a year.  Although this use was more than experimental, it was fairly infrequent, occurring only at certain social events when offered to her.  Since 2002, she has 
not used any illegal drugs and indicates that she has no intentions of ever using illegal drugs again.  She has matured, and plans to marry a man who does not 
use illegal drugs, nor does he want her to ever use them.  She understands that the use of illegal drugs is prohibited by law and against DoD policies.  She also 
understands that holding a security clearance is incompatible with illegal drug use.  There is no evidence that the Applicant has engaged in illegal drug 
involvement since 2002, a period of almost two years.  Given the fact that the Applicant's drugs use occurred several years ago, there is no indication of recent 
drug use, and there is a credible commitment to remaining in a drug free lifestyle in the future, sufficient rehabilitation and mitigation has been shown.  
itigating conditions 1 and 3 apply.  Accordingly Guideline H is found for the Applicant.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence 
supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Formal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Paragraph 1: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    Subpara.  1.a.: For the Applicant.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
