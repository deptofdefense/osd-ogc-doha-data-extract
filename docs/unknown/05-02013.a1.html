<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On September 28, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested a 
hearing. On April 13, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Barry M. Sax denied Applicant's request for a security clearance. Applicant lodged a timely 
appeal pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In his appeal, Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge did not take into account the receipts that Applicant sent in.  He objects to the Judge's findings 
and conclusions, and he restates portions of his testimony in explanation or mitigation of the allegations against him.  We interpret Applicant's appeal as 
contending that the Administrative Judge's decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  The Administrative Judge found that Applicant had 
numerous debts which he had either not paid off or for which he could not substantiate payment.<A HREF="05-02013.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The Administrative Judge also found that Applicant had 
been arrested for various offenses, including embezzlement, burglary, and grand theft.  Finally, the Administrative Judge found that Applicant had stated on his 
security clearance application that he had registered for the draft, that he had no felony arrests, and that he had never been charged with drug or alcohol 
offenses, which statements were false.  Upon our review of the record evidence we conclude that the Administrative Judge's findings were sustainable.  
Furthermore, we find no basis to disturb his conclusion that "Applicant has not come close to overcoming the evidence supporting the Government's concerns, 
as stated in the SOR."   Thus, the Administrative Judge did not err in denying Applicant a clearance. </SPAN></P>

<P><A NAME="N_1_">1. </A>The Judge held the record open after the hearing for the submission of additional information.  The financial information which Applicant submitted at that 
time does not obligate the Jduge to find that Applicant had resolved his financial difficulties.  Applicant submitted an agreement he entered into with a credit 
counseling company after the hearing, including a payment plan with payments to start almost two months after the hearing.  The other document Applicant 
submitted was a promise by another person to pay one of Applicant's debts in the future.</P>
