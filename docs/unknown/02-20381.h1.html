<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 22 July 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">denial or revocation of 
his clearance because of foreign influence.<A HREF="02-20381.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 8 August 2003 and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 29 July 
2004 and I convened a hearing on 17 December 2004. DOHA received the transcript 27 December 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted that his spouse is a citizen and resident of Taiwan (1.a.), but denied the remaining the allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate that 
admission as a finding of fact. He is a 45-year-old field engineer employed by a defense contractor since August 1987. He seeks to retain the industrial security 
clearance he has held during that employment. He previously had a clearance while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1979 to 1987, reaching the rank of 
Staff Sergeant (paygrade E-6).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a U.S. citizen, born, raised, and educated in the U.S. He was first married from 1983 to May 1995, when his first wife died. He has two sons and a 
step-son from his first marriage.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Beginning in 1992, Applicant--who worked in his employer's foreign military sales (FMS) division--began regular business trips to Taiwan in support of his 
employer's contract with the U.S. Navy to build ships for the Taiwanese navy. He met the woman who would later become his second wife on one of these 
trips. She was from a rural aborigine family in the Taiwanese mountains, orchard farmers by trade. She has an uncle, who Applicant has met a number of 
times,<A HREF="02-20381.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> who was once a county "senator" in Taiwan, but has returned to private life as a Presbyterian minister (1.d.). Although she has resided with Applicant in 
the U.S. for brief periods of time (one of which was on a humanitarian visa in approximately 1997), she is not able to obtain U.S. citizenship or legal permanent 
resident status because of a disqualifying drug conviction in Taiwan when she was 19 years old (approximately 20 years ago).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant married his second wife during one of his business trips to Taiwan in February 1996. His job in FMS later moved him to Taiwan in October 1996, 
where he resided with his wife until late 1998. He then returned to the U.S. because of delays in the ship building contract he was working on. In November 
1998, Applicant and his wife had a son born in Taiwan, who derived U.S. citizenship from his father. The child's dual citizenship status is unclear from the 
record.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's FMS job continued to take him to Taiwan, as well as other foreign countries. In November 2000, Applicant and his wife had a second son born in 
Taiwan, who also derived U.S. citizenship from his father. This child's dual citizenship status is also unclear from the record. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ship building contract returned Applicant to Taiwan in June 2002 and he resided there until May 2004. However, the stress of his FMS travel had taken its 
toll on his marriage, which deteriorated to the point where his wife was spending substantial time with her family in the mountains. When Applicant returned to 
the U.S. in May 2004, they agreed to separate. Their minor children still reside with the wife in Taiwan, but she has indicated that Applicant may have custody. 
He is in the process of retaining a Taiwanese attorney to obtain the divorce and transfer custody of the children.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">During Applicant's periods of residence in Taiwan and his business trips there, his principal point of contact with the Taiwanese government on the ship 
building contract was a Taiwanese naval officer. Although the bulk of the contacts were government-sanctioned, Applicant developed the kind of social 
relationship typical of business relationships: office parties, retirements, etc. Applicant has had no contact with the naval officer since returning to the U.S. in 
ay 2004. Applicant has since moved out of the FMS division because he wanted to decrease his foreign travel to be more available to deal with one of his 
older children, who was experiencing disciplinary problems.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Taiwan is a multiparty democracy, whose authorities generally respect the human rights of its citizens. There is no evidence in the record that the government of 
Taiwan targets U.S. intelligence information. Taiwan is an active collector of industrial information and does engage in industrial espionage. However, there is 
no evidence in the record that it seeks to exert pressure on its citizens to collect information from family members residing in country or abroad.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive, Enclosure 2 lists adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. 
Administrative Judges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and circumstances 
presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or 
absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed 
whenever a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. Considering 
the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B (Foreign Influence).</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an Applicant's security clearance. The 
government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a <EM>prima facie 
</EM>case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government's case. Because no one has a right to a security 
clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government 
has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national 
interests as their own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's suitability 
for access in favor of the government.<A HREF="02-20381.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government established a Guideline B case by demonstrating that Applicant's wife is a citizen and resident of Taiwan and his two minor children are 
residents of Taiwan (1.a., 1.b.).<A HREF="02-20381.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> However, the government failed to establish any fact regarding Applicant's relationship with the Taiwanese naval officer (1.c.) 
or with his wife's uncle, the former county "senator" (1.d), that raises security concerns under foreign influence. All Applicant's contacts with the naval officer 
can be fairly characterized as stemming from his official position as a contractor for the U.S. Navy, and those contacts ceased once the contract was completed. 
Applicant has no relationship with the uncle that could be exploited, particularly where the two cannot even communicate with each other without a translator. I 
conclude 1.c. and 1.d. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns raised by Applicant's wife are mitigated by her status as a rural farmer not employed by the Taiwanese government and not positioned to 
be exploited for information, where there is no evidence that Taiwan engages in collection activities that seek to exploit, coercively or otherwise, Taiwanese 
citizens such as her to obtain information. Any potential vulnerability is further attenuated by the fact that she and Applicant are divorcing.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security concerns raised by Applicant's minor children, although greater than those raised by his wife, are mitigated because there is no evidence that 
Taiwan engages in collection activities that seek to exploit, coercively or otherwise, the minor children of U.S. or Taiwanese citizens.  Under these 
circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely Applicant can be pressured based on his wife and minor children currently living in Taiwan. I resolve Guideline B 
for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
