<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On May 25, 2004, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry</EM>, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review</EM> <EM>Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR).  That SOR detailed why, pursuant to 
Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), it could not make the preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  In response, by letter of June 29, 2004, Applicant admitted to five of the six 
allegations brought under Guideline G and to one of the two allegations brought under Guideline E of the SOR.  He also requested an administrative

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has admitted to five of the six allegations brought under Guideline G and to one of the two allegations brought under Guideline E of the SOR</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">.  After 
a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is a 44-year-old male who has worked for a defense contractor since January 1987 and is currently working as a senior support mechanic.  After high 
school, he entered into the military in 1980 and was honorably discharged in 1984.  Applicant was first married in 1985.  He and his wife had two children, both 
of whom are now teenagers.  Eventually the couple divorced, and Applicant remarried in 2003. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has been a self-described social drinker of alcohol for the past two decades.  His consumption of alcohol was dependent on the weekend's activities.  
On Sunday, October 5, 1997, Applicant consumed several alcoholic beverages at a football game, then consumed several more alcoholic beverages at a birthday 
party prior to returning home around 1:00 a.m.  The next day, on Monday, October 6, 1997, a coworker reported that Applicant smelled of alcohol. Applicant 
was given a breathalyzer test and tested positive for alcohol with a blood alcohol level of .002.  As a result, he was temporarily suspended from his employer's 
Personnel Reliability Program and referred to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).  As part of his sanction, he agreed to submit to at least six random 
breath alcohol tests within the next year</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and to attend alcohol counseling.<A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  The counseling consisted of twice-monthly sessions for six months.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On February 2, 2001, Applicant completed and signed a Security Clearance Application, Standard Form 86 (SF-86).  He answered "no" to question 30, which 
inquired - <EM>Your Use of Alcohol: In the last 7 years has your use of alcoholic beverages (such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or 
counseling (such as alcohol abuse or alcoholism)?  Do not repeat information reported in module 21 on Form SF86 (Your Medical Record)</EM>.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Subsequently, on Saturday, February 22, 2003, Applicant attended a lengthy housewarming party and consumed about a dozen beers before proceeding to a 
local sports bar.  At the bar, he consumed three shots of tequila within an hour and decided to go home.  As he left the lighted parking lot, he realized his 
automobile lights were off and turned them on.  He then made a U-turn to access the interstate.  Having been observed by the police since leaving the bar 
parking lot, he was pulled over and given a field sobriety test around 1:00 a.m.  After showing some signs of impairment during a field sobriety test, and after 
testing positive on a preliminary breath test, he was taken to a substation where a breathalyzer test yielded a .239 blood alcohol level.  Applicant then was 
arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI).<A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Following his release on bond, he informed his employer of the incident.  Management requested that he again consult its EAP; the EAP recommended that he 
seek counseling.  Feeling that it "was the right thing to do for (his) job, security clearance, and Personnel Reliability Program eligibility," he enrolled in alcohol 
counseling at the same center at which he had previously received counseling in 1997.<A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  There, he attended eight sessions with a licensed clinical social worker 
(LCSW) from about March 2003 to July 2003.  At the conclusion of the sessions, the LCSW sent a letter to Applicant's employer in which it was noted that 
Applicant was mentally stable sand aware of the mistakes he had made in the past.  Applicant's employer, however, found this assessment too vague.  Despite 
Applicant's request for a more elucidating assessment from the LCSW, it was only after his employer formally requested a more thorough assessment that the 
LCSW offered to do more.  To that end, the LCSW then administered a test which indicated Applicant was neither alcohol nor drug dependent and sent those 
results to Applicant's employer.  Subsequently, Applicant realized that the EAP had also recommended 12 mandatory sessions for alcohol education along with 
two weekly sessions of mandatory Alcoholic's Anonymous attendance during the treatment period.<A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As of June 2004, Applicant's case was still pending.  Barring this pending charge, Applicant has a clean driving record and his license includes a "safe driver 
endorsement."  At work, he has maintained an excellent safety record and consistently received outstanding performance reviews. With regard to his current 
drinking habits, Applicant, following the 2003 incident, expressed the intent to reduce his alcohol consumption to what he terms a "moderate" level.<A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  He has 
not, however, offered any indication of what he deems to be moderate consumption or what changes he has made in his drinking habits.</SPAN></P>

</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, these adjudicative guidelines are subdivided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or 
revoke one's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to determine one 
could still be eligible for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In application, an Administrative Judge is not strictly bound to the adjudicative guidelines. As guidelines, they are but part of an amalgam of elements for the 
Administrative Judge to consider in assessing an applicant in light of the circumstances giving rise to the SOR, as well as in assessing the applicant as a whole.  
The concept of the "whole person" means that all available, reliable information about the person - whether it is good or bad, present or past - should be 
considered in making a fair, impartial, and meaningful decision as to his or her suitability to hold a security clearance.  To that end, Enclosure 2 also sets forth 
factors to be considered during this part of the adjudicative process, including: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individuals age and maturity at the time 
of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a full and thorough examination, however, the final assessment must comport with the considerable gravity of the final decision.  There is no right to a 
security clearance<A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> and one seeking access to classified information must be prepared to enter into a fiduciary relationship with the United States Government 
that is inherently predicated on trust and confidence.  Therefore, when the facts proven by the Government raise doubts as to an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has the heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy.  As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  
Therefore, any doubts will be resolved in favor of the national security, not the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Finally, it should be noted that Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 
specifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Therefore, nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any 
express or implied determination as to Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG>Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption. </STRONG> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM>The concern</EM>.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, 
failure to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline E - Personal Conduct. </STRONG> <STRONG><EM>The concern</EM>.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="03-18791.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns pertaining to this adjudicative 
guideline, are set forth below.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I find 
the following with regards to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), the Government has established its case.  Applicant admits to the allegations contained in the SOR that he 
was arrested for DUI in 2003, that he tested positive for alcohol on the job and was consequentially both suspended from work and referred for counseling in 
1997, and that he continues to consume alcohol.  Such a history raises a genuine security concern with regard to Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition 
(AC DC) E2.A7.1.2.1 ([<EM>a</EM>]<EM>lcohol related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence....</EM>) and AC DC E2.A7.1.2.2 ([<EM>a</EM>]<EM>lcohol-related 
incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job</EM>).  Further, given the existence of residual 
alcohol in Applicant's system the morning after his 1997 drinking incident, and the blood alcohol level of .239 involved in his 2003 DUI, AC DC E2.A7.1.2.5 
([<EM>h</EM>]<EM>abitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment) </EM>seems equally applicable.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline E (Personal Conduct), the Government has similarly established its case.  Specifically, Applicant's failure to disclose his 1997 
alcohol counseling on his SF-86 application raises a genuine security concern with regard to Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.2 
([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, 
or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities</EM>) and PC DC E2.A5.1.2.4 ([<EM>p</EM>]<EM>ersonal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's 
vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community 
standing or render the person susceptible to blackmail</EM>).<EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With disqualifying conditions thus established, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised.  Although only two incidents in which his 
drinking became a public concern are cited, there is no evidence indicating whether these alcohol-related incidents reveal common weekend consumption or 
isolated bouts of excess.  Therefore, mitigation cannot be found under Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition E2.A7.1.3.1 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he alcohol related incidents 
do not indicate a pattern</EM>).  Additionally, the last incident occurred as recently as 2003, obviating the applicability of AC MC E2.A7.1.3.2 ([<EM>t</EM>]<EM>he problem 
occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem</EM>).  Moreover, because the Applicant's only reference to any change in his alcohol 
consumption since his DUI is a bare, unsubstantiated, 2003 statement that he intended to consume alcohol in moderation in the future, mitigation cannot be 
applied under AC MC E2.A7.1.3.3 ([<EM>p</EM>]<EM>ositive changes in behavior supportive of sobriety</EM>).  Furthermore, although Applicant received counseling following 
these incidents, there is no indication that he received the formal diagnosis and additional support that are required to invoke AC MC E2.A7.1.3.4 ([<EM>f</EM>]<EM>ollowing 
diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence, the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient rehabilitation along with aftercare 
requirements, participates frequently in Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization, has abstained from alcohol for a period of at least 12 months, and 
received a favorable prognosis by a credentialed medical professional or licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program</EM>).  Consequentially, none of the mitigating conditions available under Guideline G apply.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With regard to his personal conduct under Guideline E, and the denial on his 2001 security clearance application that he had received alcohol-related treatment 
or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or alcoholism) in the past 7 years, Applicant fails to address factors that could raise any of the mitigating conditions 
under that Guideline.  Instead, he argues that he has never been treated for alcoholism and that any counseling received was, to his knowledge, not specifically 
for alcohol abuse.  Indeed, he goes further by stating that the majority of all counseling attended did not focus on the use of alcohol.  I find his argument 
unpersuasive.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, Applicant's argument introduces the question of whether the counseling he received in 2003, and which initially was determined to be too vague 
for his managers, was, indeed, alcohol counseling, rather than personal counseling.  The SF-86 at issue, however, was signed in 2001.  Therefore, the real issue 
is whether his use of alcoholic beverages resulted in any alcohol-related treatment or counseling in the 7 years <EM>prior </EM>to that security clearance application.  The 
evidence clearly shows that the 1997 incident did result in alcohol counseling.  Moreover, given that it was made a part of a sanction that included an agreement 
to submit to random blood alcohol tests in the future, and followed his arrival at work smelling of alcohol and possessing a residual blood alcohol level, the 
motivating intent for the counseling seems apparent.  With no additional argument or evidence to the contrary, and in the absence of some indication that any of 
the mitigating conditions found under Guideline E apply, I conclude that Applicant's answer on his SF-86 was false, and that he has failed to mitigate the 
security concerns this untrue answer raises.    </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I have considered both the record evidence and the Applicant using the "whole person" concept.  Applicant is a husband, a father, and a well regarded employee 
who is in his prime and in a responsible, professional position.  After the 1997 incident, he was issued a warning by his superiors as to what  repercussions 
further incidents might raise.  Regardless, in 2003, he chose not only to imbibe beer and tequila to the point that his blood alcohol was nearly three times the 
legal limit, but to drive a motor vehicle on the public roads in an advanced state of intoxication.  This is precisely the type of questionable judgment that lays at 
the core of both Guideline G and Guideline E.  Furthermore, because Applicant has failed to elaborate on any subsequent ameliorative adjustments to his 
alcohol consumption, he has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by these past actions.  Based on the evidence and on Applicant's failure to mitigate 
the security concerns raised by the Government's case, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I find all the allegations against the Applicant and in the Government's favor.</SPAN></P>
