<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On 28 July 2003, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons  (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision<A HREF="02-21013.h2.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>-security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive. Applicant 
answered the SOR in writing on 26 August 2003 and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 30 July 2004. 
On 24 August 2004, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 2 September 2004.</P> 
<P>Before the hearing, over the objection of Applicant's counsel, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR. The notice of the motion to amend 
was served on counsel by mail on 20 February 2004. Applicant's attorney answered on 1 March 2004. The amendment added four additional allegations to the 
SOR. See Conclusions, <EM>infra.</EM></P> 
<P>On 26 October 2004, I issued on opinion in this case. I concluded Applicant had mitigated the allegations of criminal conduct in &para;&para; 1.a, and 1.c-1.f. But I also 
concluded that, as a result of his 1973 convictions for the sale of marijuana and LSD, the Department of Defense was prohibited from granting him a clearance 
absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. I did not recommend waiver. Two days after I issued the opinion, the President signed into law 
amendments to 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Applicant timely appealed. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT">On 9 September 2005, the Appeal Board remanded the case because the record was not sufficient 
to determine whether "Applicant's convictions fall under the amended version of 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986." ISCR Case No. 02-21013 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2005). The 
Board ordered reopening of the record "to allow the parties to present evidence on whether any of Applicant's convictions resulted in him being 'incarcerated as 
a result of that sentence for not less than one year.'" <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT">Pursuant to my order, the parties submitted evidence and briefs on the matter. The Government presented a facsimile from the state historical society of 
Applicant's Division of Corrections record. Applicant did not object, so I admitted the document as Ex. 9. Applicant submitted an affidavit. The Government 
did not object, so I admitted the document as Ex. C.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 53-year-old engineering technician for a defense contractor.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from September 1969 to January 1971, during which time he held a security clearance. During his naval service, he used 
marijuana. About January 1971, Applicant was apprehended by military authorities for selling hashish to another military member and spent between 30 and 40 
days in pretrial confinement. Ex. 8 at 3; Ex. 2 at 1-2. In January 1971, Applicant was discharged before the expiration of his term of service. He received an 
undesirable discharge that was upgraded in 1980 to a general discharge under honorable conditions.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In May 1973, Applicant was charged with selling marijuana and LSD. Applicant pled guilty to selling the marijuana and not guilty to selling the LSD. He was 
convicted of both offenses and given a five-year prison term for each offense, to run concurrently. The order to serve the confinement was stayed and Applicant 
was placed in a work-release program for one year and put on probation for three years. Pursuant to the state probation statute, the judge ordered, as a condition 
on his probation, Applicant to serve the first year in the county jail. Ex. 9. Applicant does not remember whether he served all 365 days or was released early.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1973, while on the work-release program, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery. At a hearing held at the prison, the charge was dismissed 
when the victim failed to show in court. He was terminated from three different jobs while on the work-release program: one for too much unaccountable time; 
another for not being able to perform his duties; and the third for using company property for personal use.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In August 1975, Applicant was charged with violating his probation. As a result, he served 35 days in jail.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 1979, he was arrested for possession of marijuana. Applicant pled not guilty and was acquitted.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was hired by his current employer in August 1983. On 26 August 1983, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in which he 
certified that all entries were "true, complete, and accurate to the best of [his] knowledge and belief," and acknowledged that a "knowing and wilful false 
statement" could be punished as a violation of 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1001. Question 14a asked if he had ever been arrested, charged, cited, or held by Federal, state, or 
local law enforcement regardless of the disposition of the case. Question 14b asked if he had ever been convicted of any offense. Question 14c asked if he had 
ever been detained in or served time in any jail, prison, or institution under the jurisdiction of an city, county, or state. Question 15a asked if Applicant had ever 
used marijuana or hashish, except as prescribed by a licensed physician.  Applicant answered "no" to each question. <EM>Id.</EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Investigative Service agent concerning his failure to note on his SCA his arrests, convictions, and illegal drug use. 
Applicant admitted several arrests. Despite his criminal record and the fact he falsified his SCA concerning that criminal record, Applicant was granted a 
security clearance in 1984. Ex. 7 at 2.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In March 1993, Applicant was arrested for improper behavior and resisting arrest. Applicant was convicted of improper behavior/disorderly person. Tr. 71. The 
court placed him on probation for one year, ordered him to pay a fine of $500 plus court costs, to submit to urine tests, and to attend Narcotics Anonymous.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In October 1997, Applicant was arrested by police and charged with shoplifting. In January 1998, he was acquitted of the charge.<A HREF="02-21013.h2.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance." <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information." <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States 
citizens "whose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength of character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, 
discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom from conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by regulations 
governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information." Exec. Or. 12968, <EM>Access to Classified Information</EM> &sect; 3.1(b) (Aug. 4, 1995). Eligibility for 
a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal or professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may 
disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information. <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 531. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Directive presumes a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an applicant's security suitability. <EM>See </EM>ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); <EM>see </EM>Directive &para; E3.1.15. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was convicted of selling marijuana and LSD in 1973 (&para; 1.a); was arrested for selling illegal drugs in 1971 (&para; 1.c), for 
possession of marijuana</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> in 1979 (&para; 1.d), for improper behavior and resisting arrest in 1993 (&para; 1.e), and for shoplifting in 1997 (&para; 1.f); and is ineligible for a 
security clearance under 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 because he was sentenced to confinement in excess of one year as a result of his 1973 conviction for selling marijuana 
(&para; 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations in &para;&para; 1.d and 1.f, admitted in part the allegations in &para;&para; 1.c and 1.e, and neither admitted or denied the allegation in &para; 
1.b.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A history or pattern of criminal activity creates doubt about an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established the allegations in &para;&para; 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. There are allegations and admissions of criminal conduct involving both minor and 
serious offenses.  DC E2.A10.1.2.1; DC E2.A10.1.2.2. Nevertheless, the criminal activity was not recent-the last offense for which he was convicted occurred 
in 1993. MC E2.A10.1.3.1. And Applicant was acquitted of the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 1.d. and 1.e. Despite Applicant's numerous run-ins with the law, after 
considering all of the evidence, I find for Applicant on all allegations except 1.b.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In 2000, a federal statute was enacted that prohibited the Department of Defense from granting or continuing a security clearance for any applicant who was 
convicted of an offense in a U.S. court and was sentenced to more than one year in jail, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Defense. 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986 (c)(1) 
(2001). As amended in 2004, the prohibition on granting security clearances to applicants who have been convicted in U.S. courts was limited to those who are 
sentenced to more than one year in jail and were "incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than one year." 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986(c)(1) (2004).</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits he was ordered to serve the first year of his probation in a work-release program, and he was locked up in the county jail when he was not at 
work. He asserts it was not imprisonment because, except for the first month, he was not in a cell, wore street clothes and was able to move about the facility, 
and the work-release facility was separate from the county jail. He contends that, as his five-year sentence was never ordered executed, Applicant "was not 
incarcerated as a result of the sentence." Applicant's Brief at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government argues that federal courts have concluded that a sentence to work release is a "sentence of imprisonment." Government's Brief at 2 (citing 
<EM>United States v. Timbrook</EM>, 290 F.3d 957 (7<SUP>th</SUP> Cir. 2002). In <EM>Timbrook</EM>, the sole issue raised was "whether a sentence of work release in a county jail is a 
'sentence of imprisonment'" as the term was used in the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines for sentence enhancement.<A HREF="02-21013.h2.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> In that case, Timbrook had been "sentenced to 
four years of probation, including six months of work release." <EM>Timbrook</EM>, 290 F.3d at 958. Timbrook had been locked up in the county jail when he was not at 
work. <EM>Id.</EM> at 959. The court concluded the sentence to a work-release program as part of probation was a sentence of imprisonment.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although <EM>Timbrook</EM> was not a security clearance case, and involved application of the Sentencing Guidelines rather than 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986, I adopt the reasoning 
of the court. The court order that Applicant serve the first year of his probation in a work-release program was a sentence to incarceration under the terms of 10 
U.S.C. &sect; 986.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admits the court ordered him to serve his first year of probation in the county jail pursuant to that part of the state probation statute authorizing a 
work-release program, but is unsure that he served 365 days or less. The Government has the burden of establishing any contested facts. The government 
established Applicant was sentenced to more than a year in jail, but failed to establish the actual term of his incarceration as being at least one year, as required 
by 10 U.S.C. &sect; 986. Therefore, I must find for Applicant on &para; 1.b.</SPAN></P>
