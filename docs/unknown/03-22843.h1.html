<P>Applicant drove while under the influence of alcohol on at least three occasions and kicked out the window of a police patrol car on another.  He deliberately 
omitted from his security clearance application information concerning his 1997 DUI and 1998 and 2002 liens placed against him for failing to pay his state 
income taxes.  Applicant failed to mitigate alcohol consumption, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 10 June 2004, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons<A HREF="03-22843.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision-security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline J (Criminal 
Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.  Applicant answered the SOR in writing on 10 July 2004 and elected to have a hearing before 
an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on 19 January 2005.  On 9 February 2005, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 18 February 2005.  I 
kept the record open until 24 February 2005 to permit Applicant to get an affidavit from his security officer concerning his Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (QNSP).  In an affidavit (Ex. K), signed on 21 February 2005, Applicant asserted he had been unable to get such an affidavit because the security 
officer has been ordered not to cooperate with him.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Applicant is a 48-year-old composites technician for a defense contractor.  Ex. 1 at 1, 2.  His father is a retired military veteran.  Applicant served from 1975-80 
in the U.S. Air Force.  Tr. 15.  Applicant is over six feet tall and weighed over 200 pounds.  Ex. 1 at 1.</P> 
<P>From approximately 1990 until 2001, Applicant "typically consumed an average of eight or nine beers, three or four times each week."  Ex. 9 at 3.  In 
September 1997, Applicant was involved in a motor vehicle accident.  Applicant was driving erratically, as if he was not in full control of his truck, and struck 
the vehicle in front of him that was making a right turn.  Police gave him a breath test that showed he had blood-alcohol content of .12.  Applicant was 
convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) and sentenced to a fine, 120 days in jail (suspended), and DUI school. Tr. 36; Ex. 7.  </P> 
<P>In August 1998, Applicant drove his vehicle off the road into a ditch.  Fire medics eventually responded and helped Applicant out of his vehicle.  Although 
shaken up, he appeared to be uninjured.  A wrecker was called to extract the vehicle.  A police officer arrived and had Applicant sit in the back of the vehicle 
while he filled out the accident report so Applicant could submit it to his insurance company.  Applicant was cooperative in answering questions.  At 
Applicant's request, the police officer contacted one of Applicant's friends to give him a ride home.  Applicant began to cry and asked if the officer had been in 
the Gulf War.  When the police officer answered "no," Applicant said, "You wouldn't understand.  They treated me like shit in the military." Ex. 6 at 3.  
Applicant's friend arrived, and the police officer got out of his vehicle to tell him he could take Applicant home.  Applicant kicked out a side window in the 
back of the police vehicle, causing damage to the frame.  When the police officer asked why, Applicant said he couldn't breathe and he was being treated like 
he had been treated in the war.  <EM>Id.</EM>  The officer removed Applicant from the vehicle, arrested him, and put him in cuffs and leg irons.  The officer smelled 
alcohol on Applicant's breath, but apparently no sobriety tests were performed.  Charges of malicious mischief were dismissed when Applicant agreed to pay 
for the damages to the vehicle.</P> 
<P>In June 1999, Applicant was arrested for DUI.  He was stopped by police after crossing the fog lines and nearly running off the road. Applicant smelled of 
alcohol and had difficulty exiting the vehicle.  Applicant was unsteady and demonstrated positive cues of impairment.  When the officer checked, he discovered 
Applicant's vehicle registration had expired.  The sticker on the plate had been altered.  Applicant pled guilty to DUI.  Tr. 50-51; Ex. 8.</P> 
<P>In August 2001, Applicant was stopped by police after he swerved his vehicle across several lanes of traffic and straddled the median lane/curb lane divider.  
His BAC was .105 and .092.  He pled guilty to endangering the lives of other due to his intoxication and impaired ability to drive and DUI.  Ex. 4; Ex. 9 at 2.</P> 
<P>On 3 January 2003, Applicant signed his security clearance application (SCA) certifying that his statements therein were "true, correct, and complete" to the 
best of his knowledge and belief.  Question 24 asked if Applicant had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs.  Ex. 1 at 
6.  Applicant answered "yes" and listed his DUI offenses in 1999 and 2001.  Question 26 asked if, in the previous seven years, Applicant had been arrested for, 
charged with, or convicted of any offenses not listed in other modules of the SCA.  Applicant answered "no."  Question 36 asked if, in the previous seven years, 
Applicant had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts.  Applicant answered "no."</P> 
<P>There is insufficient evidence of record to find Applicant had liens placed against him for failing to pay his state income taxes.</P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so."  Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance."  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7.  
It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline G--Alcohol Consumption</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant consumed alcohol to excess from1974 until at least August 2001 (&para; 1.a); pled guilty in September 2002 for an arrest in 
August 2001 for DUI (&para; 1.b); was convicted in June 1999 for a DUI offense (&para; 1.c); was arrested in Sept 1997 and charged with DUI (&para; 1.d).  Applicant 
admitted each allegation, except that found in &para; 1.a.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure 
to control impulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A7.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline G through its evidence and Applicant's admissions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant has had 
alcohol-related incidents away from work-his three DUIs and kicking out the window of a police vehicle.  DC E2.A7.1.2.1.  His admission to consuming six to 
eight beers a night, three of four nights a week, from 1990 through 2001 amounts to habitual and binge<A HREF="03-22843.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> consumption of alcohol.  DC E2.A7.1.2.5.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant claims he quit drinking and has been sober since 28 August 2001.  Tr. 24.  An Applicant may mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns by 
demonstrating the problem occurred a number of years ago and there is no indication of a recent problem (MC E2.A7.1.3.2) or that he has made positive 
changes in behavior supportive of sobriety (MC E2.A7.1.3.3).  As the last incident was over three years ago, I will apply MC E2.A7.1.3.2.  I am not able to 
apply MC E2.A7.1.3.3 because Applicant's testimony was not credible.  He insists he only had two or two and one-half beers before each of his arrests.  Yet he 
is over six feet tall and weighed over 200 pounds.  Two drinks in such a person will not raise a person's blood-alcohol level to .12.  At the hearing, Applicant 
testified he had had six drinks before one of his DUI arrests, but later reverted to his two drink story.  He also claims the police were out to get him, whether it 
was trying to suffocate him in the police vehicle by leaving him in the back of the vehicle without air conditioning or tampering with the Breathalyzer so he 
would appear to be intoxicated.  His testimony does not pass the common sense test.  After observing his demeanor and considering his testimony as a whole, I 
am not convinced he has abstained from alcohol since August 2001.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline J--Criminal Conduct</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the SOR, DOHA alleged Applicant was arrested three times for DUI, as described in &para;&para; 1.b-1.d (&para; 2.a) and was arrested in August 1998 and charged with

reliability, and trustworthiness.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A10.1.1.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman" STYLE="font-size: 11pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established each of the allegations</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.  Applicant drove drunk on three occasions and committed criminal mischievous on another.  Applicant 
committed criminal conduct (DC E2.A10.1.2.1) consisting of, at the very least, multiple lesser offenses (DC E2.A10.1.2.2).  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is a criminal offense to

the United States.  <EM>See Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. at 527.  Applicant deliberately falsified answers in his SCA by deliberately failing to note his September 1997 DUI arrest 
and the liens that had been placed against him in 1998 and 2002 for failing to pay his state income taxes.  Although not charged in the SOR under Guideline J, 
it is evidence of criminal conduct that convinces me Applicant is not entitled to mitigation under MC E2.A10.1.3.1-the criminal behavior was not recent.  I find

conditions apply.  The Government failed to establish liens were placed against Applicant in 1998 and 2002 for unpaid state income taxes.   I find against 
Applicant on &para; 3.a and 3.b, but for him on &para; 3.c.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>
