<P>Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason issued a decision, dated March 31, 1997, in which he
concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security
clearance for Applicant. Applicant appealed. For the reasons set forth below, the Board affirms
the Administrative Judge's decision.</P>

<P>This Board has jurisdiction on appeal under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P>

<P>Applicant's appeal presents the issue of whether the Administrative Judge's adverse security
clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Procedural History</STRONG></P>

<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated August
19, 1996 to Applicant. The SOR was based on Criterion H (Drug Involvement), Criterion E
(Personal Conduct), and Criterion J (Criminal Conduct).</P>

<P>A hearing was held on January 28, 1997. The Administrative Judge later issued a written
decision in which he concluded it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or
continue a security clearance for Applicant. The case is before the Board on Applicant's appeal
from that adverse decision.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Appeal Issue</STRONG></P>

<P>The Administrative Judge made findings about Applicant's history of drug abuse and concluded
Applicant's history of cocaine abuse (1988-November 1995) warranted formal findings against
Applicant under Criterion H.<A HREF="96-0582.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> The Judge also found that Applicant deliberately falsified
information about his drug abuse history on three separate occasions (December 1994, August
1995 and February 1996) and concluded those falsifications warranted formal findings against
Applicant under Criteria E and J. The Judge concluded Applicant's cocaine abuse and deliberate
falsifications were not sufficiently mitigated by the favorable evidence of Applicant's recent
positive changes in his lifestyle to warrant a favorable security clearance decision.</P>

<P>Applicant does not challenge the Administrative Judge's findings about his cocaine abuse history
or his falsifications. However, Applicant states: (a) he "made some bad choices" in the past; (b)
he got help for his drug problem; (c) he has "had a great deal of rehabilitation"; and (d) he poses
no threat to himself, his company, or the government. The Board construes Applicant's
arguments as raising the issue of whether the Judge's adverse security clearance decision is
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P>

<P>Applicant's history of cocaine abuse during the period 1988-November 1995 and his deliberate
falsifications in December 1994, August 1995 and February 1996 provide a rational basis for the
Administrative Judge's negative conclusions about Applicant's security eligibility. A history of
drug abuse can be grounds for denying or revoking a security clearance. <EM>See</EM> Directive,
Adjudicative Guidelines, Drug Involvement. <EM>See also AFGE Local 1533 v. Cheney</EM>, 944 F.2d
503, 506 n.6 (9th Cir. 1991)(discussing several ways that involvement with illegal drugs poses
security risk). Similarly, deliberate falsifications made in connection with a security clearance
application or during a security clearance investigation raise questions about an applicant's
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. <EM>See</EM> Directive, Adjudicative Guidelines, Personal
Conduct. <EM>See also Harrison v. McNamara</EM>, 228 F. Supp. 406, 408 (D. Conn. 1964)(lying on
application for government position requiring a security clearance raises questions as to person's
reliability and justifies dismissal), <EM>aff'd per curiam</EM>, 380 U.S. 261 (1965).</P>

<P>The favorable evidence cited by Applicant on appeal does not demonstrate the Administrative
Judge committed error. The Judge specifically noted the favorable evidence presented by
Applicant and concluded it was insufficient to outweigh the negative implications of Applicant's
history of cocaine abuse and his deliberate falsifications. The Judge's analysis of the favorable
and unfavorable evidence was consistent with the "whole person" concept of the Directive and
the requirement of Section F.3. to evaluate the overall facts and circumstances of an applicant's
case. <EM>See also Carosella v. U.S. Postal Service</EM>, 816 F.2d 638, 643 (Fed. Cir. 1987)(agency has
discretion to balance seriousness of employee's conduct against applicable mitigating factors).
Nothing in Applicant's appeal brief persuades the Board that the Judge acted in an arbitrary or
capricious manner or contrary to law in weighing the favorable and unfavorable evidence in this
case.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></P>

<P>Applicant has failed to meet his burden on appeal of demonstrating error in the proceedings
below. Accordingly, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's March 31, 1997 decision.</P>
