<P>The Applicant has past due indebtedness in excess of $19,000 to eleven different creditors.  His past due indebtedness is a result of a number of factors: 
immaturity, being unprepared for married life, the recent loss of his spouse, and underemployment.  There are two debts, totaling about $260, that he has 
apparently satisfied.  However, he is presently barely surviving on welfare; and as such, the Applicant is unable to address any of his other past due 
indebtedness.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On October 15, 2002, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the 
Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant filed an Answer to the SOR on November 21, 2002.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The case was received by the undersigned on February 26, 2003.  A notice of hearing was issued on March 17, 2003, and the case was heard on April 10, 2003.  
The Government submitted documentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The transcript was 
received on April 24, 2003.  The issue raised here is whether the Applicant's current financial difficulties militate against the granting of a security clearance.  
[The Applicant admits all of the allegations of the SOR.]</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony.  The Applicant is 27 years of age, has two 
years of college, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Guideline F - Financial Considerations</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Prior to the Applicant's marriage in December of 1996, he "had adequate finances" (Transcript (TR) at pag 24 lines 3~5).  He attributes his current past due 
indebtedness to "low income, unwise choices, bad judgement and also a period of immaturity" (TR at page 24 lines 1~3).  The Applicant's current financial 
difficulties were further complicated by the loss of his spouse in August of 2002 (TR at page 25 lines 8~11, at page 42 line 20 to page 43 at line 24, and AppX 
C).</P> 
 
<P>1.a., 1.c.~1.e., and 1.g.~1.m.  The Applicant owes in excess of $19,000 in past due indebtedness to eleven different creditors (TR at page 28 line 16 to page 29 
line 1, at page 31 line 18 to page 32 line 7, at page 32 lines 10~21, at page 33 line 15 to page 34 line 2, at page 34 line 20 to page 36 line 2, at page 38 line 15 to 
page 39 line 19, at page 39 line 25 to page 41 line 1, and Applicant's Exhibit (AppX) E at pages 2, 4~8 and 10~15).  The Applicant has sought consumer credit 
counseling; but as he is currently on welfare, the counseling service is unable to help the Applicant (TR at page 26 line 25 to page 27 line 17, and AppX F).  
The Applicant has no extra income to address his past due indebtedness (<EM>id</EM>).</P> 
 
<P>1.b. and 1.f.  The Applicant has offered credible evidence that he has addressed $260 in past due indebtedness owed to two creditors (TR at page 30 line 9 to 
page 31 line 11, at page 34 lines 9~19, and AppX E at pages 3 and 9).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Mitigation</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Applicant's Site Manager, a retired Navy Captain, thinks highly of the Applicant, and avers, in part, the following:</P> 
 
<P>[The Applicant's] . . . financial situation in 2001 and prior was dreadful, but his family support is strong.  Since his [sworn] statement of July 2001, he has made 
progress rectifying his financial problems and worked through a family tragedy.  I do not think that . . . [the Applicant] poses a security risk to te Defense 
Department (AppX A).</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></CENTER> 
</SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 and Section E2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors and conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern, and which must 
be given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  The conditions</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">should be followed in every case</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">according to the pertinent 
criterion, however, the conditions are neither automatically determinative</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance 
on his own common sense.  Because each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that these 
conditions exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Conditions most pertinent to evaluation of this case are:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Financial Considerations</SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">1.  A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">3.  Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include</SPAN>:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As set forth in the Directive, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all the relevant and 
material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a. Nature, extent, seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding circumstances.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">b. Frequency and recency of the conduct.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">c. Age and maturity of the applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">d. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequence 
involved.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">e. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">f. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The 
Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government must make out a case under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and 
trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified 
information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Then, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past 
adverse conduct is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  The Government must be able to place a high 
degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></SPAN></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Applicant has in excess of $19,000 in past due indebtedness.  Other than paying about $260 towards two his past due debts, the Applicant, due to a lack of 
income, has been unable to do anything else to address his financial responsibilities.  Disqualifying conditions 1 and 3 are thus applicable in this case, as the 
Applicant has a "history of" and an "inability" to satisfy his past due debts.  He is to be commended for his recent attempt to seek consumer counseling, and one 
hopes that one day he will be able to follow through with a repayment plan; but as he is unable to do so at present, his current financial difficulties are clearly of 
present security significance.  Guideline F is therefore found against the Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering all the evidence, the Applicant has not rebutted the Government's case regarding his financial difficulties.  The Applicant has thus not met the 
mitigating conditions of Guideline F, and of Section E2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline F.</SPAN></P>
