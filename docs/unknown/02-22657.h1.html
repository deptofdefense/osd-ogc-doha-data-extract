<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 22 September 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or 
revocation of Applicant's clearance because of financial considerations and personal conduct.<A HREF="02-22657.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> Applicant answered the SOR on 23 October 2003 and 6 January 
2004 and requested a decision without a hearing. He did not respond to the Government's 12 March 2004 File of Relevant Material (FORM). The record closed 
24 April 2004, the day the response was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 12 May 2004 to decide if clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted  the financial allegations of the SOR, except for subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and e. Accordingly, I incorporate these admissions as findings 
of fact. He denied falsifying his clearance application.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He previously had a clearance while on active duty in the 
Army from 1992 to 1998. He </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">has a history of financial irresponsibility.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 1997--about 18 months before his enlistment was to expire--Applicant leased a new sports car for four years.<A HREF="02-22657.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> He made the payments on the lease 
until August 1998 when he got out of the Army and went to school full time. While in school, he had no steady income. He got some veterans' benefits, but 
otherwise paid for college with student loans underwritten by the U.S. Department of Education. Between September 1998 and August 2000, when he 
completed his degree requirements in aerospace engineering,<A HREF="02-22657.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> Applicant received eight loan disbursements totaling nearly $28,000.00. Before obtaining his 
current job, he was unemployed from August 2000 through January 2001, a period which would entitle him to a deferment on repaying the educational loans. 
However, once he became employed full-time in January 2001, he should have begun repayment on his educational loans. He did not. When interviewed by the 
Defense Security Service (DSS) in January 2002, he acknowledged and discussed a number of delinquent accounts. He did not discuss his student loan 
accounts, and his personal financial statement did not show any payments on the educational loans. Applicant's answer claims the accounts have been 
consolidated and he is now in the third month of a 12-month grace payment period. Applicant provides no corroboration of this claim, nor does he indicate 
whether he is now actually paying on the educational loans.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because he had no income while in college, Applicant stopped paying his bills, including his lease payment on the car. He has made no payment on the car 
since at least September 1998. The manufacturer eventually repossessed the car. In June 2000, the manufacturer obtained a judgment against Applicant for 
nearly $10,000.00 (including court costs and attorneys fees) plus 10% interest. The judgment remains unpaid.<A HREF="02-22657.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> With interest, the debt is now nearly 
$14,000.00.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In February 2001, Applicant disclosed the automobile repossession and judgment on his clearance application, but did not disclose three delinquent debts 
totaling about $900.00. He claims this was an oversight on his part and could not have meant to mislead the government because he disclosed the automobile 
issues. Of the four debts Applicant denies, he claims two are paid and two have been uncorroborated by the creditor after he inquired about them. However, he 
provides no documentation of his claimed payments or his contacts with the other creditors. The record contains no evidence of Applicant's character or work 
performance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section 6.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS (GUIDELINE F)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.1. The Concern: An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Unexplained affluence is 
often linked to proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.1. A history of not meeting financial obligations;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.2.3. Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A6.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PERSONAL CONDUCT (GUIDELINE E)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2A5.1.1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">The Concern</SPAN>: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. . . </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2. A5.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.2.2. The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts  from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to an 
applicant to establish security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence of 
disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts 
proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to 
demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 
(1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established its case under Guideline F. The record demonstrates Applicant's substantial indebtedness and his irresponsible handling of his 
financial obligations. Although he knew his enlistment was up in August 1998, Applicant entered into a four-year lease agreement on an expensive sports car. 
He then decided to enter college full time with no other means of support than educational loans and his minimal veteran's benefits. With no income, he simply 
stopped paying his bills. Applicant suggests he had no other choice because he was in school full time, but that argument ignores the voluntary choice he made 
to go to school full time and not undertake even part-time work. More tellingly, even though he became employed full time after receiving his degree in 
December 2000, he apparently took no action to address his educational loans until he received the SOR in September 2003. His other major debt, the lease 
judgment, remains unpaid. He has not corroborated any claimed payments or settlements or attempted contacts with the creditors alleged in the SOR.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial difficulties are both recent and not isolated; indeed they are ongoing. 
They are not due to events beyond his control. While he may no longer be digging himself into a financial hole, he has not substantiated his claims that he has 
pulled himself out of it. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government has established Applicant's omission under Guideline E, but I resolve this issue in Applicant's favor. Whether the omission was deliberate or 
not, the $800.00 omission was de minimis compared to the disclosed $10,000.00 judgment. I conclude Guideline E for Applicant.</SPAN></P>
