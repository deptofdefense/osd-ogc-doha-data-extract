<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Applicant's wife is a citizen of the People's Republic of China (China). Her parents are citizens and residents of China. Applicant traveled to China in 2004 to 
visit his in-laws. He has failed to mitigate the foreign influence concerns that exist. Trustworthiness determination is denied.  </P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 28, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were recommending 
his case be submitted to an Administrative Judge for a determination that he is not eligible to occupy an Information Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III.<A HREF="05-05658.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence) and Guideline E (personal 
conduct).   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted a sworn answer to the SOR that was received by DOHA on December 2, 2005, and requested a decision be issued without a hearing.  
Applicant admitted all SOR allegations.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on December 13, 2005, that was mailed to Applicant on December 28, 2005. Applicant 
acknowledged receipt of the FORM on January 31, 2006. The cover letter accompanying the FORM informed Applicant he had 30 days from receipt of the 
documents to submit his objections or information he wished to be considered. Applicant did not submit any objections or otherwise respond to the FORM 
within the time allotted. The case was assigned to me March 28, 2006. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits<A HREF="05-05658.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>, I make the 
following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 33 years old and has been employed by a government contractor as a software engineer since August 2000. He was born in the People's Republic 
of China (China), immigrated to the United States at an unknown time, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen on July 7, 1996. He attended college in the U.S. 
from September 1998 until December 2003, and was awarded a bachelor of science degree. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's mother is 57 years old, resides in the U.S., is a citizen of China, and obtained permanent resident status in the U.S. in or about 1989. Applicant's 
father is 59 years old, resides in the U.S., and is a U.S. citizen. Applicant married a Chinese citizen in November 2000. His wife obtained permanent resident 
status in the U.S. in or about May 2004. Applicant's mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of China. He traveled to China to visit his 
parents-in-law in February 2004. Applicant does not have contact with anyone in China other than his parents-in-law.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">On April 25, 1999, Applicant was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped by police because the occupants were not wearing seatbelts. The police officer 
asked Applicant to display a driver's license issued by the state in which he was stopped. Because Applicant's driver's license had been issued by another state, 
he informed the officer he did not have the requested license. The officer searched Applicant, discovered the foreign state license, arrested Applicant and 
charged him with Giving False Information to Police. Applicant appeared in court and was fined $20.00.   </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant signed a Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) on January 15, 2004, in which he answered "No" to question 16: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><EM>Your Police Record</EM></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> In the last 
7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s)? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150.)</EM> In the statement he provided to a 
Special Investigator for the Office of Professional Management (OPM) on September 30, 2004, Applicant stated he didn't list the 1999 arrest in the SF 85P 
because he didn't realize the incident was considered criminal.  </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a trustworthiness position. Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline B, 
pertaining to foreign influence, and Guideline E, pertaining to personal conduct, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a trustworthiness determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest for an applicant to be granted eligibility to 
hold a position requiring such trust.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts. The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance 
of evidence, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof. Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but 
less than a preponderance of the evidence. Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance 
decision.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The clearly consistent standard indicates that trustworthiness determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. Any reasonable doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Foreign Influence</SPAN>. A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound 
by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could create the potential for foreign 
influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also 
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Public trust position decisions are not loyalty determinations and should not be construed as such. Instead, the issue is whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant an Applicant eligibility for occupancy of a public trust position in a particular case. No suggestion has been made, and there is no 
reason to doubt, that Applicant is anything but a loyal, honorable, and faithful U.S. citizen. However, the analysis does not stop there.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's wife is a citizen of China and her parents are citizens and residents of China. Applicant visited his parents-in-law in China in February 2004. 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or 
resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their citizenship status, if the potential for 
adverse foreign influence or duress exists</EM> apply based upon Applicant's presumed close ties of affection and obligation with his wife and, at least vicariously 
through her, with his parents-in-laws.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Chinese Communist Party is authoritarian in structure and ideology and it dominates the government of China (GE 7). The government of China has a 
history of human rights abuses in violation of internationally recognized norms (GE 7). The presence of Applicant's parents-in-law in China clearly places them 
in a position where they can be exploited by the Chinese government. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Once the government met its burden in this case by establishing the existence of the above noted potentially disqualifying conditions, the burden shifted to 
Applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. Having that burden, Applicant failed to provide any 
information upon which to base a finding that any foreign influence mitigating condition applies in this case. Specifically, there is no evidence supporting 
application of Mitigating Conditions (MC) 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), 
cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the 
individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States </EM>or MC 3: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Contact and correspondence with foreign citizens are casual and 
infrequent</EM>. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The remaining Guideline B mitigating conditions have no applicability to the facts of this case. Accordingly,</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>Guideline B is decided against 
Applicant.  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM></EM></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information. Applicant wrote "I admit" next to the various paragraphs contained in the sole Guideline E 
allegation. However, the explanation he provided to an OPM investigator on September 30, 2004 for not listing the offense that forms the basis of the Guideline 
E allegation is credible. Reading his statement and SOR response together, and considering the nature and disposition of the offense involved, it is apparent he 
misunderstood the gravamen  (i.e., a deliberate falsification) of the Guideline E allegation. Accordingly, and despite Applicant's apparent admission to the 
allegation, I find he did not deliberately fail to disclose the arrest and conviction in the SF 85P he submitted.    </SPAN></P>
