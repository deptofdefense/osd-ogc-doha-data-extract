<P>Approximately 27 years ago, when the Applicant was a young woman, she was charged with two counts of forgery, a felony.  She pleaded guilty to these two 
felonies and was sentenced to two years in jail, suspended, on each charge, and she was placed on probation.  There is no evidence of any other criminal 
conduct on her part.  Under the provisions of 10 U.S.C. Sec. 986(a) the DoD is prohibited from granting a security clearance to such an offender who is 
presently working as a DoD contractor employee.  Consideration of a waiver is recommended.<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On October 18, 2001, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, stating that DOHA could not 
make the preliminary affirmative finding<A HREF="01-05323.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> 
<P> it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  On 
November 5, 2001, the Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing.</P> 
<P>The Applicant was forwarded a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  on January 28, 2002, and was given the opportunity to file objections 
and submit material in extenuation, mitigation, or refutation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.  The Applicant's response to the FORM was due on March 
23, 2002.  No response has been received.  I was assigned the case on March 27, 2002, on which date the record herein was closed.  The Department Counsel 
presented six (6) exhibits (Items).</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Statement of Reasons (SOR) consisted of allegations predicated on the following sole guideline: paragraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).  The 
undersigned Administrative Judge completely and thoroughly reviewed the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, makes the 
following Findings of Fact:</P> 
<P>The Applicant is a 46-year-old Program Analyst employed by a U.S. Government contractor since April 2000.  The Applicant seeks to obtain a Secret personnel 
security clearance.</P> 
<P>The Applicant, when completing her Standard Form 86, (security clearance application), on November 27, 2000, admitted to having been convicted of the 
crime of forgery.  In her Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admits to the cited violation and on June 13, 1975 she pleaded guilty to two counts of Forgery and 
she received a sentence of two years in jail, suspended, on each charge, to run concurrently, and she was placed on probation for two years.  She successfully 
completed probation without any incident.</P> 
<P>The Applicant in her Answer further denies that the cited incident shows a pattern of criminal activity, as this single criminal offense occurred more than twenty 
five years ago.  At that time, her actions were driven by immaturity, homelessness, and inexperience.  Since then she states that she has been a productive and 
responsive member of the work force and the community.  </P> 
<P>The Applicant has successfully participated in a marriage relationship that has lasted more than twenty seven years; she has provided a stable home 
environment for her family; and she has successfully reared two happy, health, productive children, ages 27 and 26.  One of her children is a current contractor 
with the FBI with a Top Secret clearance working in Virginia.  The other child  is a licensed insurance agent and office manager in Georgia.  The Applicant is 
actively involved as a volunteer with her local volunteer Fire Department, and she was elected recording secretary in 2001.  In addition to her other activities, 
she actively supports, promotes and participates in community events in her neighborhood.  </P> 
<P>The Applicant sets forth her professional accomplishments as follows:</P> 
<P>For more than nine year she has worked as a contractor for the US Department of State.  During this time she has participated in or has been entrusted with 
classified activities and information; She has never been cited for a security violation, nor has she ever been cited for inappropriate activities in connection with 
her position; She is a trusted confidant for senior management and has maintained the highest levels of security and sensitivity for a program that is classified.  
She performs and conducts her duties while protecting classified or sensitive information from inappropriate disclosure at all times.  For more than five years 
she has acted as the unit security officer within her group.  It was her task to oversee all aspects of physical security within her area, and she provided her group 
members with guidance on proper security procedures for protection and storage of classified material.  During this time no security violations or incidents 
occurred. </P>

<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive (32 C.F.R. part 154 appendix H) sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an individual's security 
eligibility.  The guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in determining whether to deny or revoke a clearance (Disqualifying Conditions or DC) 
and those that may be considered in determining whether to grant or continue an individual's access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions or MC).  
In evaluating this case, relevant adjudicative guidelines as set forth below have been carefully considered as the most pertinent to the facts of this particular 
case.</P> 
<P>The guidelines, disqualifying conditions, and mitigating conditions most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this care are:</P>

determination required, the Administrative Judge may draw only those inferences and conclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of

classified information as that term is defined and established under Executive Order 12958, effective on October 14, 1995.</P>

<P>Initially, the Government has the burden of providing controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.  The United States Supreme Court has said:</P> 
<P>"It is difficult to see how the Board would be able to review security-</P> 
<P>clearance determinations under a preponderance of the evidence</P> 
<P>standard without departing from the 'clearly consistent with the </P> 
<P>interest of the national security' test.  The clearly consistent standard </P> 
<P>indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they</P> 
<P>must, on the side of denials.  Placing the burden on the Government</P> 
<P>to support the denial [of a security clearance] by a preponderance of</P> 
<P>the evidence would inevitably shift the emphasis and involve the</P> 
<P>Board in second-guessing the agency's national security determinations."</P> 
<P>See <EM>Dept. Of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  This Administrative Judge understands that Supreme Court guidance in its context to go the 
minimum <STRONG><EM>quantum</EM> </STRONG>of the admissible evidence that must be adduced by the Government in these proceedings to make its case, that is, substantial evidence but 
something less that a preponderance of the evidence-rather than as an indication of the Court's tolerance for error below.<A HREF="01-05323.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>The burden of going forward with the evidence then shifts to the Applicant for the purpose of establishing his or her security eligibility through evidence of 
refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the case or through evidence of an affirmative defenses.  Assuming that the Government's case is not refuted, and 
further assuming it can reasonably be inferred from the facts proven that an Applicant might deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard properly classified 
information, the Applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate he or she is nonetheless eligible to hold a security clearance.<A HREF="01-05323.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors,  the undersigned concludes that the Government established its 
case with regard to Guideline J.</P> 
<P>The Applicant has admitted that she was convicted in the United States of a state crime and sentenced to imprisonment of a term exceeding one year.  
Predicated on that evidence, Title 10 United States Code. Sec. 980 prohibits the grant of a security clearance by the Department of Defense (DOD) to her as an 
employee of a contractor of the Department of Defense.  The statute is applicable even though the offense occurred more than 27 years ago when the Applicant 
was a young woman.  Therefore, SOR Paragraph 1.b., is concluded adversely to the Applicant.</P> 
<P>It is noted that the Deputy Secretary of Defense incorporated his June 7, 2001, implementation of the statute into the existing framework of the Directive and its 
guidelines.  Consequently, Section 6.3 of the Directive is applicable to this case.  That provision of the DoD regulation requires that the decision must be "a fair 
and impartial common sense determination" based on, <EM>inter alia</EM>, the guidelines at enclosure 2 of the Directive and the factors identified on pages 5 and 6 <EM>supra</EM>.</P> 
<P>The evidence reveals that the Applicant committed a serious crime (forgery).  This falls within the scope of DC #b, which is identified on page 5 <EM>supra</EM>.  In 
mitigation, the evidence of record reveals that the criminal behavior was not recent, that it was an isolated incident, and that there is clear evidence of successful 
rehabilitation.  These factors fall withing the scope of MC #a, MC #b, and MC #f, which are also identified on page 5 <EM>supra</EM>.  Furthermore, the SOR presents 
adverse evidence under only a single guideline (Guideline J).  Therefore, the adjudicative guidelines contained in enclosure 2 of the Directive provide in part:</P> 
<P>Although adverse information concerning a single criterion <STRONG>may not</STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG>be sufficient </STRONG>for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be</P> 
<P>disqualified if available information reflects a recent or recurring</P> 
<P>pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally </P> 
<P>unstable behavior.  (Emphasis supplied).</P> 
<P> Clearly there is no available evidence of "recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or emotionally unstable behavior."  Common 
sense dictates that the Applicant has long been rehabilitated, with regard to criminal activity, and that she presents little identifiable <EM>present</EM> security risk.  The 
Secretary of Defense should personally review this case with a view to determining whether to authorize a waiver of the prohibition in subsection (a) of 10 
<SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">U.S.C.</SPAN> Sec. 986.</P> 
<P>Each clearance decision is required to take into consideration pertinent factors set forth in Section 6.3 of the Directive and in the adjudicative process discussion 
at enclosure 2 to the Directive.  These factors are identified on pages 5 and 6 <EM>supra</EM>.  The nature of the crime committed was very serious and weighs against the 
Applicant.  The "frequency and recency" of the criminal conduct and the Applicant's age when she committed it weigh in her favor.  The presence of 
rehabilitation and the probability that the conduct will not recur in the future weigh decisively in her favor.  Therefore, SOR Paragraph 1.a., is concluded 
favorably to the Applicant.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FORMAL FINDINGS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Formal findings as required by Enclosure 1 of the Directive (see paragraph (7) of section 3 of Executive Order 10865, as amended) and the additional 
procedural guidance contained in item </P>

<P>In light of all the circumstance presented by the record in this case, it is the determination of the undersigned that it is not clearly consistent with the national
