<P>  The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On February 16, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of 
reasons advising Applicant of the basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), of Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written record.  On November 25, 2005, 
Administrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and 
E3.1.30.</P> 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge's decision should be overruled because Applicant is now making payments on his debts.   
Applicant's efforts to improve his financial situation since the date of the hearing constitute new evidence, which the Board may not consider.  <EM>See</EM> Directive &para; 
E3.1.29.</P> 
<P>Applicant also repeats statements made in the proceedings below that he is a loyal American and would never compromise American security interests.  The 
Administrative Judge noted those statements in his decision.  Applicant has not documented that the Administrative Judge erred by concluding that under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Applicant's history of delinquent  indebtedness precluded a favorable adjudication.</P>

</P> 
<P>The decision of the Administrative Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.</P>
