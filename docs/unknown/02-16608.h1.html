<P>The security concerns raised by a 37-year-old Lebanon-born naturalized U.S. citizen Applicant (also a citizen of Lebanon) with a Lebanon-born mother and 
three siblings, all of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the U.S., and an aunt and cousins who are citizens and residents of Lebanon, with whom he 
does not maintain close ties of affection or obligation, none of whom are agents of that foreign government or in a position to be exploited by that foreign 
government, have been mitigated by the evidence developed herein.  Clearance is granted.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On July 21, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, <EM>"Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry,</EM> dated February 20,1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>"Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, 
or revoked.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In sworn written statements, dated August 7, 2003, and September 25, 2003, respectively, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and 
elected to have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's written case on October 20, 2003.  
A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> was provided to Applicant, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material 
in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.  He apparently chose not to do so.  The case was assigned to me on January 14, 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has admitted all of the factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence under Guideline B (subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.).  Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance the level of which has not been divulged.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>Applicant was born in 1966 in Lebanon of Lebanese parents.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  During the Lebanese civil war in 1977, his father immigrated to the United States,<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and one 
year later, Applicant (at the age of 12), his mother, two brothers, and one sister, also immigrated to the United States.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  Both his parents and all three siblings, 
as well as Applicant himself, became naturalized U.S. citizens.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  Everyone but the sister were naturalized in the 1980s, and she was naturalized in 1999.  
Applicant was naturalized in 1989.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Applicant's father is deceased.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  His mother and three siblings reside in the United States.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  He also has several aunts 
and cousins who are citizens and residents of Lebanon.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has no retirement rights, benefits, or financial interests in Lebanon.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  He has never served in the Lebanese military and would never bear arms for 
Lebanon.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  Applicant's father served in the Lebanese army and his mother owns property in Lebanon, of an undisclosed value, and now receives a pension 
from the Lebanese Government based on his father's military service.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Since his arrival in the United States Applicant has adopted American culture, been educated in the U.S., started a career, and voted in U.S. elections.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A>  He 
owns property in the U.S.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Although he retains some feelings towards Lebanon, he would be willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>  Applicant has never held a Lebanese 
passport.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>It is not known when he commenced his current position.  The quality of his professional performance has not been characterized.</P> 
 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Disqualifying Conditions) and those that may be considered in deciding whether to grant an 
individual's eligibility for access to classified information (Mitigating Conditions).</P> 
 
<P>An Administrative Judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human 
behavior, these guidelines, when applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision set forth in Section E.2.2., Enclosure 2, 
of the Directive, are intended to assist the Administrative Judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions.</P> 
 
<P>Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision.  The Adjudicative Process factors which an 
Administrative Judge should consider are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include 
knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>GUIDELINE B - FOREIGN INFLUENCE:  A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other 
persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence, or obligation are: (1) not citizens of the United States or (2) may be subject to duress.  
These situations could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  Contacts with citizens of 
other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable 
to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in 
the Conclusions section below.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount determinant, the final decision in each case must be arrived at by applying the standard that the 
issuance of the clearance is "clearly consistent with the interests of national security,"<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> or "clearly consistent with the national interest."  For the purposes 
herein, despite the different language in each, I have concluded both standards are one and the same.  In reaching this Decision, I have drawn only those 
conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture.</P> 
 
<P>In the decision-making process, the burden of producing evidence initially falls on the Government to establish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with 
the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information.  If the Government meets 
its burden, the heavy burden of persuasion then falls upon the applicant to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to 
overcome the doubts raised by the Government's case, and to ultimately demonstrate it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the 
applicant's clearance.</P> 
 
<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a 
relationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship that the Government 
must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this 
Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN>One additional comment is worthy of note.  Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  
Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied decision as to Applicant's 
allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.</P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, an assessment of credibility, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, 
including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">With respect to Guideline B, the Government has established its case.  Applicant has been portrayed as a person who is a potential security risk because 
members of his immediate family or persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence, or obligation--in this instance, his mother, two brothers, and a sister 
are dual citizens of Lebanon and the United States (and residents of the United States), and his aunt and cousins are citizens and residents of Lebanon--are 
either not citizens or residents of the United States or may be subject to duress.  These situations raise the potential for vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or 
pressure, and the exercise of foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.  However, the mere possession of family ties with a 
person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The language of [Guideline] B (Foreign Influence) in the Adjudicative Guidelines makes clear that the possession of such family ties <EM>may</EM> pose a security risk.  
Whether an applicant's family ties in a foreign country pose a security risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of 
those family ties.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 98-0419 (April 30, 1999) at p. 5.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The citizenship status of Applicant's immediate and extended family, when considered in light of the nature of the government in the Lebanese Republic--a 
constitutional republic which, to my understanding, has been wracked by civil war from 1975 until 1991, and which is still partially occupied by Syrian military 
forces and several terrorist organizations--makes an analysis involving the adjudicative guidelines and the various applicable conditions set forth therein, a bit 
more difficult.  Applicant's mother, two brothers, and his sister, as well as himself, are already naturalized U.S. citizens, and only the continuing dual Lebanese 
citizenship of their birth, gives cause for concern.  The Lebanese citizenship and residency of his aunt and cousins, raises the issue of potential foreign influence 
as well.  In this regard, see Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (DC) E2.A2.1.2.1. (<EM>an immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has 
close ties of affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident or present in, a foreign country</EM>).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It is with some interest that I note that the Department Counsel has made no distinction between Applicant's immediate family--all of whom are dual citizens 
and residents of the United States--and the members of his extended family--all of whom are citizens and residents of Lebanon.  Furthermore, no evidence has 
been offered by the Government indicating any sinister Lebanese intentions or activities, such as industrial espionage or active collection of foreign economic 
information, directed towards the United States.  Likewise, I have seen no indication in <EM>Annual Reports to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and 
Industrial Espionage </EM>prepared by the National Counterintelligence Center, or in the <EM>Intelligence Threat Handbook </EM>published by The Interagency OPSEC 
Support Staff, commenting on any such activities or threats posed by Lebanon.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also applicable, in this instance, is Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (MC) E2.A2.1.3.1. (<EM>a determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, 
father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers, sisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a 
foreign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States</EM>), and MC E2.A2.1.3.5. (<EM>foreign 
financial interests are minimal and not sufficient to affect the individual's security responsibilities</EM>).  After an examination of the evidence, I determine that 
Applicant's mother and siblings, as well as himself, considering their citizenship and residency status, notwithstanding the property she owns in Lebanon or 
pension she receives from Lebanon because of his late father's prior military service, do not constitute an unacceptable security risk.  His entire immediate 
family is comprised of long-standing residents of the United States who have chosen to make their life here with their allegiance to the country of their acquired 
citizenship, rather than the country of their birth.  Their continuing personal relationships with each other have no security significance.  Moreover, none of the 
members of his immediate family are agents of Lebanon or in a position to be exploited by Lebanon. Considering the absence of any scintilla of evidence that 
they are targets of any intelligence gathering efforts, their citizenship and residency status does not establish any doubts regarding possible duress.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Also, the citizenship and residency of Applicant's aunt and cousins, are of insubstantial concern because there is no evidence that they are persons with whom 
Applicant has close ties or affection or obligation.  Applicant and his family departed Lebanon in 1977-78, Applicant has never held a Lebanese passport,<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> and 
in the past seven years he has not traveled outside of the United States.<A HREF="02-16608.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A>  There is no evidence to indicate the aunt and cousins residing in Lebanon have what 
could be construed as close ties of affection or obligation.  Thus, I conclude Applicant has, through evidence of extenuation and explanation, successfully 
mitigated and overcome the Government's case with respect to Guideline B.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.e. of the SOR are concluded in favor of 
Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access to classified information.</SPAN></P>
