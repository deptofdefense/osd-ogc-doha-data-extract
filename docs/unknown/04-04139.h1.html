<P>Applicant's consumption of alcohol led to his arrest for minor in possession of alcohol in 1995, disorderly conduct in 1998, public drinking in 1999, and 
driving under the influence in 2002. Over the three years since the DUI, he has demonstrated maturity in fulfilling his obligations as an employee for a defense 
contractor and as a provider for his fiancee and their two-year-old daughter. While he continues to drink beer on occasion, he does so responsibly and exhibits 
no signs of an alcohol problem. Alcohol consumption concerns are mitigated. Applicant's failure to comply with his legal obligation to register for the Selective 
Service was unintentional. Clearance is granted.</P> 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>On March 30, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons 
under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline E, personal conduct, why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.<A HREF="04-04139.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>On April 20, 2005, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. On September 7, 2005, I issued a notice 
scheduling the hearing for September 29, 2005. At the hearing, eight government exhibits were admitted and testimony was taken from Applicant and four 
other witnesses on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript received on October 19, 2005. At the government's request, administrative notice was also taken of the 
ilitary Selective Service Act, consequences of failing to register, and potential remedial actions. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>DOHA alleged under Guideline G that Applicant consumed alcohol at times to intoxication from about 1994 to at least February 3, 2004, was arrested and fined 
in 1994 or 1995 for minor in possession of alcohol, was arrested in August 1999 for public drinking, and was arrested and sentenced for an October 2002 DUI. 
Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have failed to register with the Selective Service System. Applicant admitted the conduct, which he attributed to 
youth and irresponsibility, but submitted he had since settled down and matured. Applicant's admissions are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After 
a complete review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings:</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 29-year-old machinist who has been employed by a defense contractor since February or March 2003. He seeks a secret-level security clearance 
for his duties, which include some of the more difficult jobs in his department. Applicant is considered "one of the bright lights" by his second-level supervisor 
because of his excellent work ethic.</P> 
<P>Applicant started drinking beer in high school with friends on the weekends. He dropped out of high school in the 11<SUP>th</SUP> grade before his 18<SUP>th</SUP> birthday and two 
weeks later went to work for a plastics factory. He continued to socialize with the same friends, and drank six to ten beers on Friday and Saturday nights.</P> 
<P>On one occasion in about 1995 when Applicant was out with a friend "cruising around," this friend was pulled over for speeding. Applicant, who had a bottle of 
vodka between his feet, was charged with minor in possession of alcohol. He was fined $100.</P> 
<P>In February 1996, he began working as a machinist. He refrained from drinking to intoxication during the work week, but went to work on occasion with a 
hangover from drinking on the weekend, although he still got the job done. In mid-May 1998, Applicant went out drinking with a couple of friends. Police 
observed one of Applicant's companions drinking in the street, confiscated the beer, and arrested Applicant's friend for public drinking. Applicant became 
verbally irate with the police and was arrested for disorderly conduct. He had consumed alcohol before his arrest.</P> 
<P>Since he reached legal drinking age before most of his friends and did not want to drink in a bar by himself, Applicant's drinking habits did not change on 
reaching 21. In mid-August 1999, Applicant was observed drinking beer in the parking lot of a local fair ground and he was arrested for public drinking. In 
possession of a case of beer, he paid only minor court costs.</P> 
<P>In early 2002, Applicant met his fiancee at a local bar where she worked as a bartender. Applicant regularly came into the bar on Sunday afternoons to watch 
sporting events with his friends and generally consumed a few beers. They began dating, and Applicant began to have tardiness problems at work due in part to 
going out with his fiancee, but also to a lack of interest in a job that he perceived had no future and little monetary reward. He had not received a raise in three 
years. In September 2002, he was fired from his job as a mechanic for tardiness.</P> 
<P>Applicant was caught for driving at an extremely high rate of speed in early September 2002. Since the police smelled alcohol on him, Applicant was 
administered field sobriety tests, which Applicant passed. He pleaded nolo contendere to reckless driving and was ordered to perform 40 hours of community 
service.</P> 
<P>In mid-October 2002, Applicant went to the bar where his fiancee worked to pick up the keys to her residence. Since he had a job interview that next morning, 
he did not plan to make it a late night. After drinking between four and six beers at the bar, he was stopped for weaving. Applicant failed field sobriety tests and 
was arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) and refusal to submit to a chemical test. He pleaded nolo contendere and was sentenced to a $694 fine and 
court costs, 10 hours community service, three months loss of license, and a driver retraining school, where the consequences of drunk driving were brought 
home to him by victims' family members. No other alcohol counseling was recommended. On completion of the driver retraining sessions, his driver's license 
was reinstated in May 2003.</P> 
<P>With the assistance of his future mother-in-law's boyfriend, Applicant was hired on as a machinist by his present employer. Needing a secret clearance for his 
duties, Applicant executed a security clearance application on January 30, 2003. He disclosed his firing from his previous job for tardiness, and his DUI and his 
reckless driving offenses. Applicant responded "No" to inquiry into whether he had registered with the Selective Service System. The SF 86 submitted to the 
government includes the following remark, "SUBJECT STATES HE DOESN'T RECALL BEING ASKED TO REGISTER." After this requirement to register 
was brought to his attention, Applicant contacted the Selective Service as he was not certain whether he had complied. He was informed he had not filed and 
could no longer do so since he was over age 26.</P> 
<P>In early 2003, Applicant learned that his fiancee was expecting their daughter, who was born in August 2003. The DUI and fatherhood helped him realize that 
he had to "grow up." He reduced his drinking to two or three beers weekly. He consumed alcohol to intoxication on his birthday in September 2003 and once in 
January 2004, but did not drive a vehicle on either occasion.</P> 
<P> On February 3, 2004, Applicant was interviewed by a Defense Security Service (DSS) special agent about his alcohol consumption and related offenses, his 
failure to register for the Selective Service, and some minor indebtedness. Applicant admitted drinking in the past on weekends to intoxication and/or hangover 
with negative legal consequences, but explained that he had slowed his consumption to two or three beers weekly after the DUI with the exception of the two 
occasions (birthday and three weeks before his interview). He expressed his intent to continue drinking minimally. Concerning his failure to register with the 
Selective Service, Applicant indicated,</P> 
<P>"When I completed my security clearence [sic] application I did not recall regerstering [sic] with Selective Service at the age of 19. I thought maybe that I did 
this and just forgot about it. I researched this and learned that I had not done this in the past. The Selective Service is sending me a form to complete." (Ex. 2)</P> 
<P>In late January 2005, Applicant's half-brother died unexpectedly of hypothermia when he was out drinking with friends for his 21<SUP>st</SUP> birthday. During the first 
couple of weeks after his brother's funeral, Applicant drank more than usual, up to ten beers per occasion. He did not drive a vehicle after drinking in that 
quantity. Following this initial mourning period, Applicant went back to drinking a couple of beers occasionally while watching sporting events. Approximately 
once monthly, he and his girlfriend go out and he consumes about six beers, enough for "a slight buzz." They get a designated driver. As of his hearing in late 
September 2005, he had last consumed six beers in mid-August, when he and his fiancee went to a party hosted by her family. Applicant and his fiancee stayed 
at the host's residence that day and did not drive home. Applicant does not drink wine or hard liquor.</P> 
<P>Applicant has been a good provider for his fiancee, a devoted father to his daughter, and a dedicated worker for his employer. Applicant spends his weekends 
and nights primarily caring for their daughter since his fiancee works as a bartender. He spends time with his parents on weekends,  taking his daughter on 
camping trips with them. Before Applicant and his fiancee moved to their present apartment, they lived with her mother to save some money. Applicant was 
trusted to stay with his fiancee's 14-year-old sister, who is disabled and fed by a G-tube. Applicant cared for her responsibly. He has not exhibited signs of 
excessive drinking at home or at work.</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>"[N]o one has a 'right' to a security clearance."  <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has "the 
authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position 
. . . that will give that person access to such information."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information "only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so." Exec. Or. 10865, 
<EM>Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry</EM> &sect; 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
security guidelines contained in the Directive. An applicant "has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant or continue his security clearance." ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.</P> 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each 
guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in &para; 6.3 of the 
Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant. <EM>See</EM> Exec. Or. 10865 &sect; 7. It 
is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.</P> 
<P>Concerning the evidence as a whole, the following adjudicative guidelines are most pertinent to this case:</P> 
<P><STRONG>Alcohol Consumption</STRONG>. Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and 
increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. (&para; E2.A7.1.1.)</P> 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct.</STRONG> Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information. (&para; E2.A10.1.1.)</P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I 
conclude the following with respect to Guidelines G (alcohol consumption) and E (personal conduct):</P> 
<P>Excessive alcohol consumption is of concern because it often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and 
increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due to carelessness. Applicant consumed alcohol irresponsibly and frequently to 
intoxication from his late teens (circa 1994) to October 2002. In addition to the 1995 minor in possession of alcohol, 1999 public drinking, and October 2002 
DUI offenses that were alleged by the government, Applicant had been drinking before his arrest in May 1998 for disorderly conduct.  Guideline G 
disqualifying conditions E2.A7.1.2.1. <EM>Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, or 
other criminal incidents related to alcohol use</EM>, and E2.A7.1.2.5. <EM>Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment</EM>, apply.</P> 
<P>In mitigation, Applicant has made positive changes in his behavior supportive of sobriety (<EM>see</EM> MC E2.A7.1.3.3.) since late 2002. The DUI program left an 
impression, particularly the accounts of those victimized by drunk drivers. His fiancee's pregnancy cemented the realization that he had to change his drinking 
behavior. Applicant reduced his consumption of alcohol to two or three beers weekly, with rare episodes of intoxication. As the primary caregiver for his 
daughter during the evenings and on weekends, Applicant has neither the desire nor the opportunity to resume the irresponsible lifestyle of his youth. While he 
drank excessively (up to ten beers at a sitting) over a couple of weeks in February 2005, it was due to grief over the unexpected death of his brother and he has 
since resumed moderate consumption. Those who know Applicant best, his fiancee and family at home and his second level supervisor at work, testified 
credibly they have seen no evidence of a drinking problem. Although he still drinks up to six beers on occasion when he goes out with his fiancee, Applicant 
has shown good judgment in not driving home. Applicant's maturation in age and his responsibilities militate against recurrence of any alcohol-related criminal 
incidents. Favorable findings are returned as to SOR &para;&para; 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d.</P> 
<P>Applicant's noncompliance with the Military Selective Service Act is potentially security disqualifying under Guideline E.<A HREF="04-04139.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Failure to register between the ages 
of 18 and 26 is punishable as a crime,<A HREF="04-04139.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and makes one ineligible for some Federal student loan and grant programs (50 App. U.S.C. &sect; 462(f)), Federal job 
training, and employment in the Executive Branch of the Federal government and U.S. Postal Service (<EM>see</EM> 5 U.S.C. &sect; 3328). However, the statutory 
disqualifications do not apply, and a person may not be denied a right, privilege, or benefit under Federal law by reason of failure to present himself for and 
subject to registration if:</P> 
<P>(1) the requirement for the person to so register has terminated or become inapplicable to the person; and</P> 
<P>(2) the person shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the failure of the person to register was not a knowing and willful failure to register. (50 App. 
U.S.C. &sect; 462 (g)).</P> 
<P>There is nothing in the Directive that specifically bars the grant of a security clearance to males born after December 31, 1959, who fail to register for the 
Selective Service. Yet, given the government must be able to impose an even higher degree of trust in those with classified access than in Federal or Postal 
Service employees in non-sensitive positions, grant of a clearance to Applicant would not be warranted in the event of a knowing and willful noncompliance.</P> 
<P>When he completed his SF 86 in January 2003, Applicant indicated he did not recall being asked to register with the Selective Service. On direct examination, 
he testified that when the requirement to register was brought to his attention, he went down to the post office, obtained registration information, and contacted 
the Selective Service "to double check to make sure that [he] hadn't registered." (Tr. 72) Had Applicant intentionally failed to register, it is unlikely he would 
have checked with the Selective Service. Applicant, who dropped out of school before he turned 18, testified credibly he did not recall receiving any notice to 
register in the mail, and it was not a topic of discussion amongst his friends. Nor had it occurred to him that he might be drafted ("I had always heard the story 
I'll-we'll never have drafts again and this and that. And it never occurred to me that I-I had never registered, no." Tr. 99). SOR &para; 2.a. is also found in his favor 
as his failure to register with the Selective Service was not knowing and willful.</P>
