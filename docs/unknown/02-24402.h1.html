<P>	Applicant, a Turkish born, United States citizen, used a Turkish identification card with his
United States passport, when entering and leaving Turkey, to avoid paying a visa fee. When he
became aware that the card identified him as a Turkish citizen, rather than just Turkish born, which
is what he initially believed, he returned the card to the Turkish embassy.  None of Applicant's

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P>	The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865
(as amended by Executive Orders 10909, 11328 and 12829) and Department of Defense Directive
5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992 (as amended by Change 4), issued a Statement of Reasons
(SOR), dated August 28, 2003, to the Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make
the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to
an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted,
or denied. The SOR was based on foreign preference (guideline C) related to his exercise of dual
citizenship with the United States and Turkey and foreign influence (guideline B) concerns because
of the foreign residency and/or citizenship of close family members.</P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant<EM></EM> filed a notarized response dated September 29, 2003, to the allegations set forth
in the SOR, and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On February 2, 2004,
the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing, and pursuant to formal notice dated February 18,
2004, a hearing was held on March 18, 2004. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Government Exhibits
1 - 5) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered fifteen documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - O)
and offered his own testimony. The transcript (TR) was received on April 1, 2004.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	In the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative
Guideline C (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Preference</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) and Guideline B (</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Foreign Influence</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">) of the Directive. The SOR
contains  two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b., under Guideline C and eight allegations, 2.a. through 2.h.,
under Guideline B. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with the exception of 1.a..  Those
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's
Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> testimony of Applicant, and upon due
consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant is 54 years old and is employed as a Senior Software Engineer by a United States
defense contractor that wants him to have a security clearance. Applicant was born in Turkey. While
he was living in Turkey, he was required to serve in the Turkish military, which he did officially
from July 1975 through October 1975. Applicant came to the United States in 1978 with a student
visa. He became a United States citizen in 1991. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant  received a Ph. D. degree in Computer Science  from a United States university
in 1983. He is divorced, and he has one 11 year old son, who was born in the United States and is
a United States citizen.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">		</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Paragraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference). The Government alleges in this paragraph
that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to indicate a
preference for another country over the United States.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	From 1996 through 2003, on 6 separate occasions, he used a Turkish identification card with
his United States passport, when entering and leaving Turkey, to avoid the necessity of paying a visa
fee for him and his son. He testified that he was unaware that the card identified him as a Turkish
citizen; rather he believed that it simply identified him as Turkish born. In 2004, when he became
aware of the fact that the card actually identified him as a Turkish citizen, he returned the card to the
Turkish embassy. At that time, he also renounced his Turkish citizenship and returned his expired
Turkish passport, which he never used after he became a United States citizen in 1991(Exhibits B
and C).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	 Applicant testified that it was his belief that when he became a United States citizen in 1991,
he renounced his Turkish citizenship (Tr at 27).</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Paragraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that
Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has immediate family members or people to whom
he may be bound by affection or obligation who are not citizens of the United States, or may be
subject to duress. </SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's mother, two brothers, one sister-in-law, and a nephew and niece reside in and
are citizens of Turkey. None of these family members belong to, participate in, or are active with any
government agency of Turkey (Tr at 28, 33-36). </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's mother, who is 74 years of age, has always been a homemaker. He communicates
with her by telephone approximately once a week. She has come to visit him here in the United
States on several occasions (Tr at 41-43).  </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Applicant's two brothers are both physicians.  He rarely telephones his older brother, and he
speaks to his younger brother approximately every other week (Tr at 25, 26). In the past, he emailed
his nephew and niece fairly regularly, but now that they are older teens, he rarely initiates contact
with them (Tr at 32-36).   </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	He doses not anticipate receiving any inheritance or other financial interest in Turkey.  He
has estimated his financial holdings in this country to be worth in excess of one million dollars (Tr
at 27, 35, 36).						</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, is to be taken into account
in reaching a decision as to whether a person is an acceptable security risk. Enclosure 2 to the
Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be carefully considered according to the
pertinent criterion in making the overall common sense determination required. Each adjudicative
decision must also include an assessment of the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and
surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual's age and
maturity at the time of the conduct; the motivation of the individual applicant and extent to which
the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences
involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the
potential for coercion, exploitation and duress; and the probability that the circumstances or conduct
will continue or recur in the future. <EM>See</EM> Directive 5220.6, Section 6.3 and Enclosure 2, Section E2.2. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Because each security case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be
assumed that the factors exhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in
every case. Moreover, although adverse information concerning a single criterion may not be
sufficient for an unfavorable determination, the individual may be disqualified if available
information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or
emotionally unstable behavior. See Directive 5220.6, Enclosure 2, Section E2.2.4. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	The following guidelines and concerns are relevant to this case:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline B Foreign Preference</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	E2.A3.1.1. The Concern: When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference
for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or
make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">						</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">					<STRONG>Guideline B Foreign Influence</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	E2.A2.1.1. The Concern: A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,
including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be bound by affection, influence,
or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could
create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified
information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also
relevant to security determinations if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion,
exploitation or pressure.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under the provisions of Executive Order 10865 as amended and the Directive, a decision to
grant or continue an applicant's clearance may be made only upon an affirmative finding that to do
so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall common
sense determination required, the Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences and
conclusions which have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. In addition, as the
trier of fact, the Administrative Judge must make critical judgments as to the credibility of witnesses.
Decisions under the Directive include consideration of the potential as well as the actual risk that an
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Burden of Proof</STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Initially, the Government has the burden of proving any controverted fact(s) alleged in the
Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets its burden and establishes conduct cognizable as a
security concern under the Directive, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to present
evidence in refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the existence
of criterion conduct, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security
clearance.			</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with
the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Where the facts proven by the Government
raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy
burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the United
States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials." Any doubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with
national security will be resolved in favor of the national security. <EM>See</EM> Enclosure 2 to the Directive,
Section E2.2.2.</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Having considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and
factors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with
respect to guidelines C and B:</SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Guideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign
country over the United States. Applicant's use of a Turkish identification raises some foreign
preference (guideline C) concerns. Disqualifying condition (DC) E2.A3.1.2.1., the exercise of dual
citizenship could be argued to apply. However, I conclude that Applicant never was aware that the
Turkish identification card identified him as a Turkish citizen. I find his testimony credible that he
believed the card only showed him to be Turkish born, and that he would not have used it had he
been aware of its full implication. It is also significant that while using this card he always only used
his United States passport. I therefore rule that DC E2.A3.1.2.1 does not apply. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	While Applicant always believed that when he became a United States citizen he renounced
his Turkish citizenship, since there was some question, he officially renounced his Turkish
citizenship in 2004.  Mitigating Condition ( MC) E2.A3.1.3.4, an expressed  willingness to renounce
dual citizenship, applies. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	Under Guideline B, a security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family,
including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he is bound by affection, influence or obligation,
are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. The evidence of</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant's
immediate family members</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">, who are citizens of and reside in Turkey comes within DC E2.A2.1.2.1.
Based on the nature of the overall record and the totality of the evidence, including the lack of
government involvement of Applicant's family members and Applicant's extremely strong
attachment to his son in the United States, and his substantial financial interests here,  I have
determined that his family members in Turkey do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, and
MC E2.A2.1.3.1. is applicable. This states that a determination that the immediate family member(s)
in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in
a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the
United States. </SPAN></P>

<BR WP="BR1"><BR WP="BR2">
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">	After considering all of the evidence of record on this issue, I conclude that the mitigating
evidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR and even in the unlikely event
pressure was exerted upon Applicant to compromise classified information, he would reject it, and
would  report the incident to the proper authorities. </SPAN></P>
