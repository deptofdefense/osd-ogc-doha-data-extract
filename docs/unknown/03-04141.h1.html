<P>Applicant deliberately omitted relevant information about his arrest record and mental health counseling from his April 2002 security clearance application (SF 
86). He also has a mental condition that could impair his judgment. While his alcohol consumption (Guideline G) is not a security concern, Applicant has failed 
to mitigate the impact of his criminal conduct (Guideline J),  mental health issues (Guideline I), or deliberate falsification of security clearance questionnaires 
(Guideline E). Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>On November 13, 2003, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns about his personal conduct, alcohol consumption, mental health, and 
criminal conduct. The SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DOHA adjudicators could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant's security clearance.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> </P> 
 
<P>On January 17, 2004, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) and admitted to the allegations in SOR subparagraphs 1.b, 2.b, and 3.a. He also requested a 
determination without a hearing. On March 30, 2004, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials with 10 exhibits (Items 1 - 10) attached 
(FORM) in support of the government's preliminary decision, a copy of which was sent to Applicant on April 1, 2004. Applicant received the FORM on April 
8, 2004, and had until May 9, 2004 to submit additional information in response to the government's case. However, Applicant did not submit anything further 
in his own behalf and the case was assigned to me on May 19, 2004.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant's aforementioned admissions are incorporated herein as facts. A<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">fter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following additional 
findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 44-year-old supply technician employed by a defense contractor since June 2001. He also served in the U.S. Air Force between 1977 and 1984, 
holding a Top Secret clearance during that time. In July 1996, he married for the third time. Two previous marriages ended in divorce in 1983 and 1988.</P> 
 
<P>In 1983 or 1984, Applicant was assigned to an overseas Air Force facility. He had just learned his first wife had decided to re-marry, thus relieving Applicant of 
his support obligations. He proceeded to celebrate his new-found largesse by drinking 13 tequila sunrise cocktails at the NCO club, causing him to pass out 
across the street. He was roused by the base police and taken to jail. At an Article 15 hearing, he was reduced in grade to Airman 1<SUP>st</SUP> Class (E-4), jailed for 30 
days, issued a letter of reprimand, and ordered to undergo alcohol awareness counseling for 90 days.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>On January 9, 1998, Applicant and his current wife got into an argument over money matters (he was unemployed due to a back injury at the time) and her 
displeasure over his weekend drinking (he had not had anything to drink that day). As the argument escalated, Applicant's step-daughter intervened and 
Applicant twice threw her to the floor, injuring her wrist. The step-daughter left the house and called police. Applicant admitted what had happened, was 
charged with Assault (Domestic Violence) and released on his own recognizance. At trial in February 1998, he was placed on 12 months probation and ordered 
to attend six months of weekly anger management sessions for men. He successfully completed the program and all other terms of his probation. In February 
1999, the judgment of conviction was discharged  and set aside.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant received mental health counseling in 1998 and 1999.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> The police report of his 1998 arrest indicates he was taking medication for anger management, 
but had not taken it that day.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> According to the Authorization for Release of Medical Information Applicant signed on October 8, 2002, his treating physician 
feels Applicant has a condition that could impair his judgment or reliability within the context of safeguarding classified information.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant has submitted two security clearance applications (SF 86) - one on August 21, 2003 and an electronic version on April 23, 2002. In neither form did 
he disclose his 1983/1984 Article 15 charge and sentence as required by question 24; nor did he disclose his 1998 arrest as required by question 26.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> Applicant 
claims he had forgotten about his Article 15 charge as it was 20 years old. As for his 1998 arrest, Applicant asked a court clerk where his trial had taken place 
whether he had to disclose the arrest. He was advised that, because the domestic violence charge was discharged and set aside, he did not have to list it.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> 
Further, Applicant answered "yes" to question 19 regarding any past mental health counseling. He also answered "yes" to the second part of that question, thus 
specifying his counseling was not related to any violence on his part.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant consumes six 16-ounce beers each weekend. He does not feel he has an alcohol problem, has not been diagnosed as alcoholic or an alcohol abuser, 
and becomes intoxicated once or twice annually.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> to be considered in evaluating an Applicant's suitability for access to classified information. The 
Administrative Judge must take into account both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue applicable to the facts and 
circumstances of each case. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. 
The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. Having considered the SOR allegations and having reviewed the record evidence as a whole, I conclude the relevant adjudicative 
guidelines to be applied here are those conditions listed under Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline G (alcohol consumption), Guideline I (mental health),  
and Guideline J (criminal conduct).<STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>A security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> for an Applicant to either receive or continue to 
have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of proving, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted 
facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it establishes a <EM>prima facie </EM>case that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest for the 
Applicant to have access to classified information. The burden then shifts to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government's case. Because no 
one has a "right" to a security clearance, the Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. The Government, 
therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the 
national interests as his or her own. The "clearly consistent with the national interest" standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant's 
suitability for access in favor of the Government.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><STRONG></STRONG>Under Guideline E (personal conduct), <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness 
to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A></SPAN> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Department Counsel has presented 
sufficient evidence in the FORM to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline and I conclude that Guideline E disqualifying condition 
(DC) 2<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies here.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant claims he forgot about his Article 15 conviction in the early 1980s; however, I find it hard to believe anyone would forget 
being in military corrective custody for a month or going through 90 days of alcohol awareness training. Further, rather than simply list his 1998 arrest, 
Applicant sought a way of not listing it and relied to his detriment on advice from a court clerk. Absent any information to show the clerk was experienced in 
matters of personnel security investigations, I decline to apply Guideline E mitigating condition (MC) 4.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A></SPAN> </P> 
 
<P>I am also persuaded of Applicant's intent to mislead the government by his answer to the second part of SF 86 question 19. By answering "yes" he avers that 
any counseling he has received in the last seven years did not involve violence on his part, despite the fact he was on medication to control his anger and he 
completed six months of male-oriented anger management counseling after his 1998 arrest. Applicant has failed to produce any information to mitigate, 
extenuate or refute the government's information about his personal conduct. I conclude Guideline E against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline G (alcohol consumption), a security concern arises where it is shown a person abuses or is addicted to alcohol, is involved in alcohol-related 
incidents such as domestic violence, driving while intoxicated or other alcohol-related criminal acts, reporting to work under the influence or with a hangover, 
or drinking on the job. Such conduct indicates poor judgment or reliability and may lead to the unauthorized disclosure of classified information.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A></SPAN> While 
Applicant has one alcohol-related incident in his background (SOR 2.b), the information presented in the FORM falls short of establishing a <EM>prima facie </EM>case 
for disqualification. One such incident two decades ago does not equate to an alcohol problem. Applicant continues to drink, but there is no available 
information about any subsequent alcohol-related incidents. Further, Department Counsel's assertion that Applicant is being treated for substance abuse is 
based on the inclusion of the words "substance abuse" in a barely-legible exhibit.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A> There is, likewise, no detail about a diagnosis or some other professional 
finding that Applicant has a problem with alcohol. I conclude Guideline G for the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline I (mental health), the concern is that emotional, mental, and personality disorders can cause a significant deficit in an individuals 
psychological, social and occupational functioning.  These disorders are of security concern because they may indicate a defect in judgment, reliability or 
stability.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The government has established a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline. A credentialed medical professional has indicated 
Applicant has a disorder that could impair his judgment or reliability, especially within the context of safeguarding classified information.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A> However, there is 
no detail available regarding his treatment other than an indication by his wife in 1998 that he is taking medication for anger control. It also appears that his 
failure to take that medication led to his 1998 arrest for domestic violence. Guideline I DC 1<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A></SPAN> and DC 2<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply.</P> 
 
<P>There is nothing in the record to support application of any Guideline I mitigating conditions. Applicant has not provided information to suggest that his 
problem is no longer present, or that it was a temporary condition. Nor is there any finding by a licensed physician or other professional in the mental health 
field suggestive of a favorable prognosis or that Applicant is not likely to suffer a defect in judgment in the future. Further, his attempt to conceal the fact he has 
received counseling or treatment related to the violent aspect of his mental state only compounds the government's concerns in this area. I conclude Guideline I 
against the Applicant.</P> 
 
<P>Under Guideline J (criminal conduct), a security concern exists where it is shown an Applicant is willing to disregard the law. Such conduct indicates an 
inability or unwillingness to abide by rules and procedures established to protect classified information.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A></SPAN> Department Counsel has presented sufficient 
evidence in the FORM to establish a <EM>prima facie </EM>case for disqualification under this guideline and I conclude that Guideline J DC 2<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A></SPAN> applies here.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Applicant 
was charged and convicted of domestic assault because he pushed his step-daughter to the ground and injured her. He had failed to take his medication that day 
and, based on available information, still requires treatment for his anger management. His criminal conduct may be considered isolated as it was 20 years 
removed from his earlier military offense, and it may not be considered a recent occurrence as it happened over five years ago. Guideline J MC 1<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A></SPAN> and MC 
2<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A></SPAN> apply. However, the record suggests that the conditions leading to both instances of criminal conduct still exist; Applicant still drinks and he still has an 
anger management problem. On balance, I conclude Guideline J against the Applicant.<A HREF="03-04141.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>I have carefully weighed all of the evidence, and I have applied the disqualifying and mitigating conditions as listed under each applicable adjudicative 
guideline. I have also considered the whole person concept as contemplated by the Directive in Section 6.3, and as called for by a fair and commonsense 
assessment of the record before me as required by Directive Section E2.2.3. These facts raise reasonable doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified 
information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests. Absent substantial 
information to resolve those doubts, which Applicant failed to provide, I cannot conclude it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant's 
request for a security clearance.</P>
