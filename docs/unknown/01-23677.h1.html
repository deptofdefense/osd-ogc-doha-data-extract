<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">SYNOPSIS</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Applicant used marijuana on a number of occasions between approximately 1998 and 2001.  He was arrested in a bedroom he had been sleeping in when police 
executed a search warrant on January 25, 2002.  The police found a large quantity of cocaine, other controlled substances, drug paraphernalia, and drug-packaging material in the bedroom.  While the charges were eventually dismissed against Applicant because of his cooperation with prosecuting officials and 
his brother accepting responsibility for the drug possession, the evidence establishes Applicant was aware the drugs were being stored in the room he was using 
as a bedroom and that his brother was dealing drugs from that room.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On April 3, 2003, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating they were unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  The SOR, which is in essence the administrative 
complaint, alleges security concerns under Guideline E for personal conduct and Guideline H for drug involvement.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant submitted an answer to the SOR on April 24, 2003, and requested a hearing.  Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR, except for the 
allegations that he was arrested for possession of a firearm.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The case was assigned to an administrative judge on May 8, 2003, reassigned to a different administrative judge on July 2, 2003, and then reassigned to me on 
July 18, 2003 when it was learned that Applicant was temporarily located in a different geographical region than his normal home.  A notice of hearing was 
issued on July 24, 2003, scheduling the hearing for August 6, 2003.  The hearing was conducted as scheduled.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The government submitted five documentary exhibits at the hearing that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5 and admitted into the record without an 
objection.  Applicant testified at the hearing and did not submit any exhibits.  The record was held open for three weeks, without an objection from the 
government, to give Applicant the opportunity to submit documentation in support of his case if he chose to do so.  No documents were received.  The 
transcript was received on August 13, 2003. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant's partial admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein.  In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, and 
consideration of the testimony presented, I make the following findings of fact:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant is 22-years-old, single, a college student, and employed as a student research associate/engineer by a defense contractor.  He attends a university 
located in the same city where his parents and siblings reside.  In January 2003, he was using a small outbuilding, located  a few feet to the rear of his parents' 
house, as a bedroom.  He had been using that outbuilding as his bedroom for somewhere between three weeks and a month as of January 25, 2002.   He was the 
sole occupant of that room, and was alone and asleep therein, when police executed a search warrant looking for controlled substances at approximately 6:29 
a.m. on January 25, 2002. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">During the course of executing the search warrant, the police found the following items in the room where Applicant had been sleeping:   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-2 baggies containing cocaine; one containing approximately 4.5 ounces and a second  containing approximately 0.7 ounces (located in the second drawer down 
from the top of the dresser);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-0.8 grams methylenedioxy methamphetamine [ecstasy] (located in the third drawer down form the top of the dresser);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-a baggy containing 0.8 grams marijuana (located in a refrigerator);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-0.2 ounces of cocaine (located in the fourth drawer down from the top of the dresser);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-2 pounds, 8.1 ounces of cocaine compressed into a brick shape, wrapped in plastic wrap and placed inside a shoe box (located in the closet); </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-4.8 ounces of marijuana in a tan shopping bag (located in the closet);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-2.8 ounces of cocaine inside a red and white plastic shopping bag (located in the closet);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-0.1 ounces of marijuana (located under the bathroom sink);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-3.6 ounces of marijuana, loose and in baggies, in a green duffle bag (located in the closet);</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-0.05 ounces of marijuana on a tray under a chest of drawers;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-a small scale, cut [a substance used to reduce the concentration of a controlled substance], and a hammer with a white residue on the head (located in the 
bottom drawer of the night stand); and</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">-2 large trash bags containing wrappers used for packaging kilogram quantities of cocaine (located in the closet).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant admitted to the police that he knew there was cocaine located in the closet of the room in which he was arrested, but claimed it belonged to his 
brother.  He also provided the police the address where his brother lived and informed them that his brother kept the money from his drug dealing at that 
address.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant was charged with Possession of a Controlled Substance/narcotic, Possession of Marijuana, and Possession of a Firearm as a result of the evidence 
gathered by the police during the execution of the search warrant on January 25, 2002.  The firearm he was charged with possessing had actually been located 
during the search of the main house.  Applicant was never observed to be in possession of the weapon or in the premises where the weapon was located.  All 
charges that had been filed against Applicant were dismissed on or about October 2, 2002, in light of the unspecified cooperation he provided in the case, and 
because of his brother's acceptance of responsibility for the cocaine that was seized.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used marijuana on at least several occasions in his senior year of high school from 1998-1999.  He also used marijuana on at least 2-3 occasions 
during his first semester of college in the fall of 1999.  He again used marijuana on at least two occasions between January 2000 and August 2001.  Applicant 
intentionally provided a false answer in the security clearance application (SF 86) he submitted on June 22, 2001 when he answered "Yes" to question 27: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Since 
the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana . . . </EM>but then claimed to have 
only used marijuana on five occasions and all uses having occurred between February 1, 1999 and March 1, 1999.  He provided the false information because 
he was concerned that answering truthfully would reflect poorly on his judgment.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Having given full consideration to Applicant's appearance and demeanor while testifying, the answers he provided during cross-examination, the false 
information he provided in the SF 86, and the multiple locations and types of drugs and drug paraphernalia found, I find Applicant testified falsely at the 
hearing when he: denied knowing that his brother was dealing drugs from the room in which he was arrested; denied knowing there was cocaine, other illegal 
drugs, or drug packaging materials in the closet; denied he had ever entered the closet; and denied he made a statement to police that he knew there were drugs 
in the closet.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's eligibility to hold a security clearance.  Chief among them are the 
Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline.  Additionally, each clearance decision must be a fair and 
impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 
through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive.  Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the 
adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.  Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline E, 
pertaining to personal conduct, and H, pertaining to drug involvement, with their respective DC and MC, are most relevant in this case.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">BURDEN OF PROOF</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A>  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is something less than a 
preponderance of evidence<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>, although the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  "Substantial evidence is more 
than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence."<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present evidence 
of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him.<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A>  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">No one has a right to a security clearance<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
national security.<A HREF="01-23677.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>     </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the central question if a person's past conduct justifies confidence the person 
can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, 
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant has used a controlled substance, marijuana, on a number of occasions, the last known time occurring two months after he submitted a SF 86 seeking a 
security clearance in June 2001.  He was also found in sole control of a small outbuilding that contained a large amount and  variety of controlled substances 
and drug paraphernalia.  His denials of knowledge of the existence of the controlled substances and actual knowledge that his brother was using the building for 
narcotics dealings are not credible.  The evidence does not support a finding that Applicant was in possession of the firearm that was found in the main house 
during the course of the search despite his having been charged with that offense.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">  Disqualifying Condition (DC) 4: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Personal conduct or concealment of information that increases an individual's vulnerability to coercion, exploitation or 
duress, such as engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing or render the person susceptible 
to blackmail</EM>; and DC 5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations</EM>  apply in this case.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">I have considered all Mitigating Conditions (MC) and conclude none apply.  Having found that Applicant was not credible in the testimony he provided 
concerning his brother's criminal activities and the controlled substances that were found in the room in which he was alone and asleep, I cannot find that MC 
5: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>The individual has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress </EM>despite the dismissal of the 
charges that was at least in part in return for cooperation which Applicant denies he provided, other than going to his own attorney's office when requested.  
C 7: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Association with persons involved in criminal activity </EM>also does not apply, because, although he apparently does not have any contact at present with his 
brother who is serving a 10-year prison sentence, he does still have contact with his brother-in-law, who was also convicted of offenses arising from the 
execution of the search warrant.   </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Under Guideline H illegal drug involvement raises questions about an individual's willingness or ability to protect classified information.  Involvement with or 
use of an illegal drug indicates unwillingness or inability to abide by the law.  Cleared employees must respect regulations whether they agree with them or not.  
If they do not respect the rules on illegal substances, they may not respect the rules designed to protect classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">Applicant used marijuana on a number of occasions between approximately the fall of 1998 and August 2001.  He also was arrested alone in a room containing 
large and varied quantities of controlled substances, packaging material, and other drug paraphernalia on January 25, 2002.  His denials of knowledge of the 
presence of the controlled substances that were found during the execution of the search warrant are not credible.    </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">DC 1: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Any drug abuse</EM>; and DC 2: </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM>Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution </EM>apply in this case.  In 
consideration of all of the evidence, and most specifically the lack of credibility exhibited by Applicant in preparing the SF 86 he submitted in June 2001, his 
use of a controlled substance after submission of the SF 86, his arrest following submission of the SF 86, and the testimony he provided at the hearing that I 
have found to not be credible, I do not find any Mitigating Condition apply as to Applicant's drug involvement. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt">After considering the evidence of record in this case, and weighing the disqualifying conditions against the mitigating conditions, I find that Applicant has 
failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his personal conduct and drug involvement.  He has failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his 
ultimate burden of persuasion.  Guideline E and Guideline H are decided against Applicant.   </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><EM> </EM>      </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 10pt"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></SPAN></P>
