<P>Forty-four-year-old Applicant had one alleged delinquent debt listed on his statement of reasons (SOR).  The debt was satisfied through foreclosure and repossession of Applicant's residence in 
2001 because no supplemental proceeding establishing the amount of the debt was filed within six months of delivery of the sheriff's deed as required under Pennsylvania law.  He falsely answered 
two questions on his security clearance application concerning the repossession and civil court action involving his residence because he was embarrassed about his financial difficulties.  He 
mitigated security concerns about financial considerations, but not about personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">PROCEDURAL RULING</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>On or about August 10, 2006, Department Counsel made a motion to amend the Statement of Reasons (SOR), adding two falsification allegations concerning Questions 35 and 40 of Applicant's 
Security Clearance Application, Standard Form (SF) 86.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A>  Applicant made a timely objection to the amendment, asserting that the government was aware of these allegations at the time the original 
statement of reasons (SOR) was prepared on August 10, 2004.  Moreover, the change to the SOR at this late date was unduly prejudicial, and violated Constitutional principles of due process.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>  
Applicant conceded that lack of notice did not cause any prejudice, or change the evidence that would be presented.  However, Applicant's memory about why he answered Questions 35 and 40 on 
his 2004 SF 86 would be more clear in 2005 when he responded to the SOR than it is now (R. 10).  On November 13, 2006, Department Counsel filed an answer to Applicant's reply. <EM> See</EM> Exhibit 
10.  </P> 
 
<P>The government was aware that Applicant answered, "No" in response to Questions 35 and 40 of his SF 86 when the SOR was signed on October 20, 2005.  Applicant subsequently provided 
additional information about the judgment that raised doubt about whether Applicant correctly answered Question 37 of his SF 86, which was an alleged falsification in SOR &para; 2.a.  The government 
recognized that other financial questions on his SF 86 were related and amended the SOR to allege Applicant falsified Questions 35 and 40 of his SF 86.  These amendments were made to provide 
notice, and to take into account potential financial issues and exigencies of proof.  Applicant received notice on August 10, 2006, which provided an adequate opportunity to prepare to address 
security concerns pertaining to Questions 35 and 40 at his hearing on November 15, 2006.  These amendments are not unfairly prejudicial.  </P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A SOR may be amended "so as to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted or for other good cause."  Directive &para; E3.1.17.  The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 99-0447 at 4 (App. Bd. 
July 25, 2000) (citations omitted) emphasized that a SOR is liberally construed, and liberally amended, stating: </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The purpose of an SOR is to give an applicant adequate notice of the allegations against him or her so that the applicant has a reasonable opportunity to respond to them. In assessing the sufficiency 
of an SOR, it is necessary to balance the need for fair notice to an applicant against the need to avoid transforming SOR pleadings into a game of wits in which a minor or technical misstep is 
decisive. As long as there is fair notice to the affected party and the affected party has a reasonable opportunity to respond, a case should be adjudicated on the merits of relevant issues and not 
concerned <A NAME="7996-11"></SPAN></A><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">with pleading niceties. <A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A></SPAN></P>

and  Constitutional due process was not violated. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Accordingly, I granted Department Counsel's motion to amend the SOR (R. 10).</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG> </P> 
 
<P>On August 10, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a SF 86.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A>  On October 20, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a SOR to him, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, <EM>Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry,</EM> dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, <EM>Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program</EM> (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct).  I granted the defense motion to amend the SOR as stated above.  The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.</P> 
 
<P>In an answer, notarized on November 25, 2005, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A>  On October 4, 2006, the case was assigned to me.  
The hearing was held on November 15, 2006.  DOHA received the hearing record (R.) on November 29, 2006, and I received it on December 4, 2006.    <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P>As to the factual allegations under Guidelines F and E, Applicant admitted that a foreclosure judgment was entered on July 19, 1999, in the amount of $120,448.60 on his residence.  The judgment 
was <EM>in rem</EM>,<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A></SPAN> and the debt resulting from the difference between the property's sale price and the foreclosure sale priced was not legally perfected.  As such any resulting debt is not legally 
enforceable.  He denied falsification of Question 37 of his SF 86 without elaboration.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A>  His admissions concerning the debt and foreclosure are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact:</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is 44 years old (R. 58).<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  From 1996 to March 2003, he has worked as an electronic technician.  Since March 2003, he has either been self-employed as a consultant or employed as test 
technician for a defense contractor.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A>  His supervisor at the defense contractor provided a letter indicating he has known Applicant since 1994.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>  He has also worked with Applicant since 2001.  
He believes Applicant is reliable and trustworthy.  He describes Applicant as a valuable asset to his company.</P> 
 
<P>He served in the Pennsylvania National Guard from 1980 to 1998, reaching the grade of E-6.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A>  He received awards for being the best overall noncommissioned officer (NCO) at annual training 
and the best NCO in the battalion in 1995 (R. 78, 80).  He attended school for 12 years and received a GED (R. 52).  In 1996, he received a diploma from a vocational, technical or trade school<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> </SPAN> 
He was married in 1980 to his current spouse.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A>  His two children were born in 1981 and 1984.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A>    <SUP></SUP></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>Financial Considerations</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>SOR &para; 1.a alleges Applicant is financially overextended because he has a judgment in the amount of $120,448.60 that is an unpaid debt.  Applicant's evidence established that the judgment was <EM>in 
rem</EM>, and had not been perfected against Applicant.  When the creditor took possession of the property, and failed to perfect the debt within six months, it was satisfied.  Accordingly, there is no 
valid, unpaid debt based on this judgment.  Nevertheless, the factual history of this foreclosure, and the delinquent debt preceding the foreclosure are relevant to the allegations of falsification of 
Applicant's 2004 SF 86. </P> 
 
<P>In 1988, Applicant purchased a house in Pennsylvania for $45,000, of which $36,000 was financed.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A>  A year or so later, he borrowed $11,000 on his equity.  In 1996, he decided to refinance with 
CF because he needed the funds for windows, and to repair problems with his home's septic system.  The mortgage with CF was an adjustable rate mortgage, and the payments were increasing  (R. 
29). His employer moved to a different state (R. 30), and his ability to repay CF was compromised when he lost his job.  He was briefly underemployed and decided to attend school to improve his 
technical skills.  By July 1999, Applicant was about three months behind on his mortgage payments to CF, which payments were about $1,225 per month (R. 39-40).   </P> 
 
<P>On July 14, 1999, Applicant made an agreement with a corporation (HR) whereby he sold<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_17_"><SUP> (17)</SUP></A> or deeded his home to HR.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_18_"><SUP> (18)</SUP></A>  Applicant promised to pay HR an initial payment of $1,600, and then 
$800 per month for rent.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_19_"><SUP> (19)</SUP></A>  HR was supposed to retain Applicant's rent payments.  No mortgage payments were to be made to CF.  HR was supposed to negotiate refinancing or debt reduction with 
CF, and if that was unsuccessful the house would go into foreclosure.  HR would attend the foreclosure sale and bid up to 85% of the fair market value of the residence, which was substantially less 
than the mortgage amount.  Applicant also expected to continue to occupy the residence, and planned ultimately to purchase his residence from HR (R. 55).  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant ceased making mortgage payments to CF in July 1999,<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_20_"><SUP> (20)</SUP></A> and CF filed the foreclosure on July 20, 1999.  <EM>Id</EM>.  Judgment for $120,449.60 was entered on that same day.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_21_"><SUP> (21)</SUP></A>  By August 31, 
2000, Applicant had paid HR $11,000.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_22_"><SUP> (22)</SUP></A>  Applicant received notice of the Sheriff's Sale (R. 41) and contacted HR.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_23_"><SUP> (23)</SUP></A>  Instead of attending the Sheriff's Sale,<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_24_"><SUP> (24)</SUP></A> and bidding for the residence as 
agreed, HR told Applicant to file for bankruptcy to stop the sale.  Applicant declined to file for bankruptcy.  Applicant stopped making payments to HR because HR did not bid at the Sheriff's Sale 
(R. 35),  which was on October 26, 2000.  CF received title to the property on November 29, 2000.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_25_"><SUP> (25)</SUP></A>  On March 1, 2001, Applicant received a ten-day notice of intention to enter default 
judgment.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_26_"><SUP> (26)</SUP></A>  On April 1, 2001, Applicant and his family moved out at the request of CF.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_27_"><SUP> (27)</SUP></A>  </P> 
 
<P>At his security interview in 2005, Applicant said he thought he owed CF about $30,000, and planned to file for bankruptcy to eliminate this debt.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_28_"><SUP> (28)</SUP></A>  HR kept Applicant's $11,000, and filed for 
bankruptcy.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_29_"><SUP> (29)</SUP></A>  Applicant has been unable to recover the money paid to HR despite writing letters and seeking assistance from his attorney (<EM>Id.</EM>; R. 35-37).  Applicant never received notice of the 
execution of any <EM>in personam </EM>judgment based on the foreclosure (R. 37-38).</P> 
 
<P> Under Pennsylvania law, CF was required to file a deficiency judgment within six months after recovery of the title to the property, if CF determined anything in excess of recovery of the 
mortgaged property was owed.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_30_"><SUP> (30)</SUP></A>  By May 29, 2001, Applicant had not heard from CF or received</P> 
 
<P> a notice involving the deficiency judgment or any supplementary proceeding establishing the amount of the debt.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_31_"><SUP> (31)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS), dated April 19, 2005, to a security investigator.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_32_"><SUP> (32)</SUP></A>  His PFS indicates his and his wife's combined net salary is $3,700 per month, and their 
expenses totaled $2,150 per month.  He listed monthly household expenses as follows: mortgage of $99,000 ($630), groceries ($500), clothing ($20), utilities ($300), car expenses ($300), life and 
other insurance ($200), and miscellaneous ($200).  His total monthly debt payment was $761, which included a car loan of $14,000 (monthly payment of $461), and taxes of $2,900 (monthly 
payment of $300), but excluded his mortgage.  The PFS lists the following assets: real estate of $170,000, savings of $4,000; stocks and bonds of $4,000, cars or boats with a value of $20,000; and 
miscellaneous with a value of  $10,000.  After deducting all expenses and his debt payments, he had a positive cash flow of $789 per month.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"> <STRONG>Personal Conduct</STRONG></P> 
 
<P>Question 37 asks, "<STRONG>Your Financial Record - Unpaid Judgements  </STRONG>In the last 7 years, have you had any judgements against you that have not been paid?"  Applicant answered, "No."  SOR &para; 2.a 
alleges that this answer is false.  As indicated previously, the judgment was <EM>in rem</EM>, rather than<EM> in personam</EM>.  Moreover there was no supplementary proceeding setting the amount of the debt.  
Accordingly, Applicant could accurately provide a negative answer to this question, and SOR &para; 2.a is not substantiated. </P> 
 
<P>Question 35 asks, "<STRONG>Your Financial Record - Repossessions  </STRONG>In the last 7 years, have you had any property repossessed for any reason?"  Applicant answered, "No." SOR &para; 2.b alleges that this 
answer is false.  Question 40 asks, "<STRONG>Public Record Civil Court Actions  </STRONG>In the last 7 years, have you been a party to any public record civil court actions not listed elsewhere on this form?"  
Applicant answered, "No."  SOR &para; 2.c alleges that this answer is false.  As discussed, the answers to Questions 35 and 40 should have been, "Yes" because his residence was repossessed four years 
earlier, and the repossession resulted from a civil court action.  </P> 
 
<P>Applicant's explanation for why he answered, "No," to Questions 35 and 40 was inconsistent.  Moreover, he had ample opportunity to consider whether to submit an SF 86 which omitted 
information about his problems with his mortgage on his foreclosed home.  </P> 
 
<P>He had his SF 86 for about a month (R. 62).  He brought his SF 86 home and asked his wife some questions as he filled it out, but he did not show it to her or ask her to review it (R. 45, 51).  It was 
returned to Applicant several times to get additional information from him concerning addresses of relatives (R. 68).  He completed it in a somewhat hurried fashion (R. 37).  In his April 19, 2005, 
statement to a security investigator he said, "As far as not reporting it<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A> on the Security Questionnaire 'I must have overlooked it!!'" </P> 
 
<P>He did not owe money from the judgment because it was paid when the creditor received possession (R. 54).  His house was not repossessed because he voluntarily gave it back (R. 55).  He signed 
it over to HR with the intent to buying it back from HR (R. 55, 77).  The failure to list the civil court action was through his "own stupidity and laziness" (R. 55, 63, 76, 81).  He figured if they 
found out about it, his SF 86 would be returned to him and he could make a correction to the form (R. 55-56; 63, 81).  He also said he did not understand Question 40 stating, "I didn't understand 
the question.  I just blew thr[ough] it in a hurry to get it done." (R. 63, 76).  He did not consult with anyone about answering the financial questions of his SF 86 (R. 56).  </P> 
 
<P>He explained that he went too fast through his SF 86 and thought if there was an error it would be returned to him for correction (R. 67).  He was aware that he was named as a defendant in a civil 
court case (R. 70).  He considered the issue of the foreclosure to be a private matter (R. 70).  The problems with HR were very stressful and embarrassing (R. 75, 82). He described it as "one of the 
hardest things I'll ever go through, very embarrassing."  <EM>Id</EM>.</P> 
 
<P>In sum, I find that the reason that he did not answer, "Yes" on Questions 35 and 40 was because he did not want to disclose embarrassing financial information.  His various statements about being 
hurried, overlooking it, believing he voluntarily gave up possession, stupidity and/or laziness are not credible.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In an evaluation of an applicant's security suitability, an administrative judge must consider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an applicant's eligibility 
for access to classified information.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">These adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines in conjunction 
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process provision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive.  An administrative judge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common 
sense decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the "whole person concept," an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Specifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive &para; E2.2.1: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness 
of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG>Since the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is "clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security." In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record. 
Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In the decision-making process, facts must be established by "substantial evidence.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A>  The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,  in 
accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">Once the government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E3.1.15 provides, "The applicant is responsible 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of 
persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition  never shifts to the government.  <EM>See</EM> ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22,

<P>A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal duty 
hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to 
whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect 
or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.</P> 
 
<P> </P> 
 
<P>The scope of an administrative judge's decision is limited. Applicant's allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically 
provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned."  Security clearance 
decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism.  Nothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole

<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG>        </CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following with 
respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG>Guideline F (Financial Considerations)</STRONG></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The government has met its initial burden under Guideline F. </SPAN> Applicant's initial failure to pay his debt to CF is of concern, especially in light of his desire to have access to the nation's secrets.  
Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), "[a]n individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.1.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person 
who fails or refuses to pay long-standing debts or is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible or careless in his or her duty to protect classified information.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  FC DC 1 applies where an applicant has a history of not 
meeting his or her financial obligations.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.1.  FC DC 3 applies where an applicant has exhibited inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.2.3. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's 
actions in initially failing to satisfy an outstanding financial obligation gives rise to FC DC 1 and 3.  Applicant admitted he was responsible for the debt listed in the SOR.  His mortgage  became 
delinquent because he had insufficient income to make his mortgage payments. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times"> The government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to 
Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.<SUP><A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SUP></SUP><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on financial problems can be mitigated by substantial evidence under FC MCs 1 or 2 that "the behavior was not recent" or "it was an isolated incident."  Directive &para;&para; 
E2.A6.1.3.1 and E2.A6.1.3.2.  </SPAN>The Directive does not define "recent," and there is no "bright-line" definition of what constitutes "recent" conduct.  Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as 
a whole,<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A> I conclude FC MCs 1 and 2 do apply because Applicant had one delinquent SOR debt which was satisfied in 2001, more than five years before his hearing.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant disclosed sufficient information to support consideration of FC MC 3, "the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a 
business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)."  Directive &para; E2.A6.1.3.3.  He indicated he was underemployed after his employer moved to a different state.  
Underemployment caused his financial problems, and he has provided enough information about changes in his financial situation, with linkage to the generation of his delinquent debt to warrant 
full application of FC MC 3.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">FC MCs 4 and 6 can mitigate a security concern arising from financial problems when</SPAN>, "the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control," <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">or "the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts." Directive &para;&para; E2.A6.1.3.4 and E2.A6.1.3.6. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">    </SPAN>There was no testimony about financial counseling.  He does not receive credit under FC MC 4 because there is no evidence that he has or will begin to receive financial counseling.  There are 
however, indicia of improved financial self-discipline, and I have confidence that he is on the right track now, and will not have future financial problems.  Clearly, the financial problem was 
resolved in 2001 and no delinquent debts have been generated in five years.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> </SPAN> </P> 
 
<P><CENTER></CENTER> 
</P> 
 
<P>FC MC 6 does not apply because there is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of his debts.  <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Appeal Board has defined the concept of good 
faith, as requiring "</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation."  ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 
2004). </SPAN> Applicant's process of using HR to resolve his mortgage problem with CF does not meet the Appeal Board's stringent definition of good faith.  Nevertheless, based on application of FC 
Cs 1, 2, and 3 and satisfaction of the delinquent debt in 2001, I conclude that security concerns pertaining to financial considerations are mitigated.   </P>

<P>Under Guideline E, "conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations could indicate that 
[applicant] may not properly safeguard classified information."  Directive &para; E2.A5.l.l. <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Three personal conduct disqualifying conditions (PC DC) could potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case.  PC DC 2 applies where there has been </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"deliberate 
omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities."  </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.2. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> A security concern 
may result under PC DC 3 when an applicant deliberately provides "false or misleading information concerning relevant and material matters to an investigator, security official, competent medical 
authority, or other official representative in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination." </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.3.  PC DC 5 applies when an applicant has "a pattern of 
dishonesty or rule violations."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.2.5.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For PC DCs 2 and 3, Applicant deliberately gave a false answer to Questions 35 and 40 of his 2004 SF 86, in an attempt to conceal his financial problems.  The evidence of record establishes SOR 
&para;&para; 2.b and 2.c by substantial evidence because he admitted preparing his security questionnaire, he understood the questions, and he deliberately provided answers that omitted material,<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> 
derogatory information. PC DC 5 does not apply to SOR &para;&para; 2.b and 2.c because the falsification occurred on the same 2004 SF 86.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A security concern based on Guideline E may be mitigated by substantial evidence of personal conduct mitigating conditions (PC MC). </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under PC MC 1, security concerns may be mitigated when 
the derogatory "information was unsubstantiated or not pertinent to a determination of judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.1. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.b and 2.c are 
established by substantial evidence, and constitute deliberate falsifications.  As such the allegations in SOR &para;&para; 2.b and 2.c are substantiated and relevant to making a security determination about his 
judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC MC 2 applies when the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"falsification was an isolated <A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> incident, was not recent,<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> and the individual has subsequently provided correct information voluntarily</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">."  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.2.  PC 
C 3<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_43_"><SUP> (43)</SUP></A> applies when the </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification before being confronted with the facts."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; E2.A5.1.3.3.  Applicant receives some credit 
under PC MC 2 and under the "whole person" analysis because only one false SF 86 was submitted to the government on August 10, 2004, approximately 30 months ago.<A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_44_"><SUP> (44)</SUP></A></SPAN>  Additionally, he 
receives some credit under PC MC 3 because he made a belated, good-faith effort to correct the record when he admitted his SF 86 contained incorrect information in his statement to an investigator 
on April 15, 2005 (albeit after being confronted by the facts), in his response to the SOR on November 25, 2005, and at his hearing.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_45_"><SUP> (45)</SUP></A></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Although his eventual admission that the clearance entries 
were false was not "prompt," he deserves some credit under the "whole person" concept for providing accurate information in 2005 and 2006. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">PC MC 4 applies  when "[</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">o]mission of material facts was caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel, and the previously omitted information 
was promptly and fully provided."</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  Directive &para; </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.4.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> There is no evidence that anyone gave Applicant improper or inadequate advice or suggested that he omit information from his SF 86. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> 
Security concerns can be mitigated under PC MC 5 when an applicant "has taken positive steps to significantly reduce or eliminate vulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or duress."<EM>  </EM></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Directive &para; 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A5.1.3.5.&nbsp;</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> Under PC MC 5, Applicant receives some credit for eventually disclosing his financial problems.

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN>In addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed above, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Directive 
</SPAN>provision E2.2.1. As noted above, Applicant's false statement on his 2004 SF 86 is a very significant security concern because it is an indication he may not safeguard classified information.  
E2.2.1.1.<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">  His actions were knowledgeable and voluntary.  E2.2.1.2 and E2.2.1.5.<SUP></SUP>  His falsification occurred relatively recently, and his initial statement to the security investigator included an 
inconsistent statement that he "must have overlooked it."  E2.2.1.3.  He is 44 years old, sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct.  E2.2.1.4.<SUP></SUP> The motivation for the falsification was 
to conceal information about his financial problems.  E2.2.1.7. There is little or no potential for pressure and/or exploitation.  E2.A6.1.1 and E2.2.1.7.  The likelihood of recurrence is low.  I am 
confident that Applicant realizes the importance of being accurate and truthful, especially when involved with security matters. However, corroborating evidence of change is sparse.  E2.2.1.6 </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">and 
</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times">E2.2.1.9. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> The absence of evidence of any prior security violation, his forthright and candid statement at the end of his hearing, his evident sincerity about ensuring his SF 86 is accurate, and his 
remorse about his SF 86 all weigh in his favor.  However, there is a paucity of supporting evidence establishing his rehabilitation.  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the 
facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">mitigated the security concerns pertaining to personal conditions, but as indicated previously security concerns 
pertaining to financial considerations are mitigated.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The evidence leaves me with grave questions and doubts as to Applicant's security eligibility and suitability. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in <EM>Department of Navy v. Egan,</EM> 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), my "careful consideration of the whole person factors"<SUP><A HREF="05-08505.h1.html#N_46_"><SUP> (46)</SUP></A></SUP></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of 
my  responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government's case. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to

<P></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">If a court's jurisdiction is based on its authority over the defendant's person, the action and judgment are denominated "<EM>in personam</EM>" and can impose a personal obligation on the defendant in favor 
of the plaintiff.  If jurisdiction is based on the court's power over property within its territory, the action is called "<EM>in rem</EM>" or "<EM>quasi in rem</EM>." The effect of a judgment in such a case is limited to the 
property that supports jurisdiction and does not impose a personal liability on the property owner, since he is not before the court. "A judgment <EM>in rem </EM>affects the interests of all persons in 
designated property. A judgment <EM>quasi in rem </EM>affects the interests of particular persons in designated property. The latter is of two types. In one the plaintiff is seeking to secure a pre-existing claim 
in the subject property and to extinguish or establish the nonexistence of similar interests of particular persons. In the other the plaintiff seeks to apply what he concedes to be the property of the 
defendant to the satisfaction of a claim against him. Restatement, Judgments, 5-9."  <EM>Hanson v. Denckla</EM>, 357 U.S. 235, 246 n. 12 (1958).
