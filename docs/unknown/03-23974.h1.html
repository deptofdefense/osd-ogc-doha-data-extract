<P>Applicant was fired in March 2002 when his defense contractor employer concluded he had committed a security violation. The security concerns raised by the 
security violation and his termination are mitigated. The totality of facts and circumstances establish that the security violation was an inadvertent, isolated 
incident. Clearance is granted. <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P>This case rose when the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On June 29, 2004, 
DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> The SOR, which is in essence the administrative complaint, alleged security 
concerns under Guideline K for security violations and Guideline E for personal conduct (termination of employment due to a security violation). Applicant 
replied to the SOR on July 28, 2004, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me August 18, 2005. With the agreement of counsel, a notice of hearing 
was issued scheduling the hearing for November 16, 2005. </P> 
<P>Applicant appeared with counsel and the hearing took place as scheduled. During the hearing, Government Exhibits 1 - 8 were admitted into evidence, while 
Exhibit 9<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> was excluded from evidence. Applicant's Exhibits A1 - A20 and A22 were admitted into evidence, while Exhibit A21<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> was excluded from evidence. 
DOHA received the 288-page transcript on December 1, 2005. </P> 
<P>The record was left open until March 17, 2006, for Applicant to pursue obtaining information about his case under the FOIA. The details of keeping the record 
were set forth in a memorandum order (Appellate Exhibit I). Subsequently, at Applicant's request and without objections by Department Counsel, the March 
17<SUP>th</SUP> deadline was extended to May 1<SUP>st</SUP>. Applicant timely submitted his post-hearing submissions, which are marked as Applicant's Exhibits B1 - B8. Also, 
Applicant's counsel submitted a memorandum explaining the relevance and significance of the exhibits (Appellate Exhibit II). In turn, on May 4, 2006, 
Department Counsel submitted a memorandum objecting to the exhibits on relevance grounds (Appellate Exhibit III). I reviewed the exhibits and the arguments 
of counsel. Department Counsel's objections are sustained; Exhibits B1 - B8 are excluded from the record evidence. Accordingly, the record of this case closed 
on or about May 4, 2006. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in subparagraphs 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are incorporated herein by reference. In 
addition, I make the following findings of fact.</P> 
<P>Applicant is a 35-year-old married man who is seeking to retain a security clearance for his employment with a company engaged in defense contracting. He is a 
senior systems administrator for the company's high performance computing center. His wife is a stay-at-home mother with a four-year-old and a one-year-old. 
Also, Applicant's wife works part-time for a defense contractor with whom she has worked for about ten years.  </P> 
<P>Applicant graduated from one of service academies in May 1993. Thereafter, he served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy until May 1998. He served 
onboard two ships where he gained extensive experience with classified information. Applicant received highly favorable performance evaluations as reflected 
in Applicant's Exhibits A5 - A8, which are incorporated herein as findings of fact by reference. </P> 
<P>In May 2000, Applicant accepted a position with a major consulting firm engaged in defense contracting. He worked with this firm as a computer consultant 
until he was fired in March 2002. When he accepted this employment, the secret-level security clearance that he previously held as a military officer was 
reinstated. Applicant's work required him to work in a classified computer lab or space where he was responsible for developing and conducting tests to 
evaluate service-level agreements between the prime contractor and the government. In other words, Applicant was essentially auditing the work of another 
defense contractor and reporting the results to the government. </P> 
<P>On or about March 29, 2002, Applicant was fired due to unprofessional conduct based on his failure to properly safeguard classified information on or about 
arch 18<SUP>th</SUP> (Exhibit 5). In short, Applicant e-mailed a classified document to another employee over the company's unclassified local area network (LAN). He 
admitted doing so in his Answer to the SOR, in his sworn statement taken during a background investigation (Exhibit 2), in his letter of rebuttal to company's 
termination letter (Exhibit 6), and in his hearing testimony. </P> 
<P>Based on the incident, the company's security officials conducted an inquiry. The company's findings and conclusions are set forth in the preliminary 
administrative inquiry (Exhibit 4) and the completed administrative inquiry (Exhibit 3). </P> 
<P>In its summary of events, the preliminary inquiry concluded that Applicant "inadvertently" e-mailed a classified document to a company employee over the 
company's LAN. The inquiry included a memorandum for the record written by Applicant. In it, he expressed "great remorse and frustration" about the incident 
and took full responsibility for his actions. </P> 
<P>The completed administrative inquiry concluded that the possibility of the compromise of classified information could not be precluded, although the computers 
and the network were successfully sanitized. It also determined that Applicant committed a "major violation" and was "clearly culpable." The inquiry credited 
Applicant for being forthcoming with information and for not trying to engage in a cover-up, but it faulted him not admitting any wrongdoing and trying to 
place the blame on others.  </P> 
<P>During the hearing, Applicant explained that was not his intent to shift the blame (Transcript at 183). Instead, he was interested in finding out what took place. 
He had worked with unclassified information for many months, he was shocked that there was a classified document contained in the archive of documents that 
he sent to the manager, and he did not understand how it happened. Applicant thought the document was unclassified, as was the usual case. The document was 
provided by a government employee who did not indicate otherwise. Applicant did not knowingly copy and e-mail the classified information over the 
unclassified LAN, as he explained in his sworn statement (Exhibit 2):</P> 
<P>I was not aware that the document in question was classified. If I would have known that the information was classified I would not have taken the information 
out of the lab. This was a serious mistake that I made. I have not had any other incidents of security violations. </P> 
<P>Since his termination in March 2002, Applicant has worked for three other companies engaged in defense contracting (including his current employer). His 
work performance has remained high, meeting or exceeding expectations (<EM>E.g., </EM>Exhibit A11).  </P> 
<P>Applicant has held a security clearance for many years as both a military officer and a defense contractor. During these many years, except for the March 2002 
incident, Applicant has not been accused of or cited for a security violation.</P> 
<P> </P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person's security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) 
and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the 
relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in &para; 6.3.1 through &para; 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence 
or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a 
case can be measured against this policy guidance. </P> 
<P>A person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree of 
trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security </P> 
<P>clearance is not a determination of an applicant's loyalty.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has 
established for granting a clearance. </P> 
<P><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>BURDEN OF PROOF</CENTER> 
</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an 
applicant.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of presenting witnesses 
and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> An applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to 
refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a 
favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A></SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">As noted by the Supreme Court in </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><EM>Department of Navy v. Egan</EM>, </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">"it should be obvious that no one has a 'right' to a security clearance," and "the clearly 
consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A> Under <EM>Egan, </EM>Executive Order 10865, and 
the Directive, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"><CENTER>CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The security violations concern under Guideline K<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A> and the personal conduct concern under  under Guideline E<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_12_"><SUP> (12)</SUP></A> will be discussed together as the matters are 
interrelated. Under Guideline K, noncompliance with security regulations raises doubt about an individual's trustworthiness, willingness, and ability to 
safeguard classified information. Personal conduct under Guideline E is always a security concern because it asks the<STRONG> </STRONG>central question if a person's past conduct 
justifies confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.</SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Here, based on the record evidence as a whole, the government established its case under both guidelines. Due to his negligence or carelessness in not making 
certain that the document in question was unclassified, Applicant committed a security violation by copying classified information onto a disk, which he took 
home without a courier brief. He then e-mailed it to a manager over his employer's unclassified LAN. As a result, Applicant was fired. Given these facts and 
circumstances, security concerns are raised under DC 2<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_13_"><SUP> (13)</SUP></A> for Guideline K and DC 1<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_14_"><SUP> (14)</SUP></A> for Guideline E. By any measure, the security violation and the resulting 
employment termination are matters that raise concerns about Applicant's suitability to hold a security clearance. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">I reviewed the mitigating conditions under both guidelines and conclude that the security concerns raised by the security violation and his termination are 
mitigated. The totality of facts and circumstances establish that the security violation was an inadvertent,<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_15_"><SUP> (15)</SUP></A> isolated incident.<A HREF="03-23974.h1.html#N_16_"><SUP> (16)</SUP></A> Indeed, Applicant has not 
engaged in a long-term pattern of negligence or questionable judgment concerning his handling and safeguarding of classified information, as the record 
evidence shows just the opposite (for example, his assigned duties in the Navy involving classified information). Concerning the incident, Applicant thought he 
was dealing with unclassified information, as was his routine at the lab. Although his employer considered the incident a major violation, the record evidence 
shows (1) it was a one-time incident that took place due to a mistake; (2) it did not take place due to a deliberate plan or design; and (3) it did not take place due 
to gross or criminal negligence. </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">In reaching this decision, I also considered the whole-person concept. Applicant has worked in positions of responsibility since completing the arduous 
requirements of graduating from one of this country's service academies. He appears to have a stable lifestyle, as evidenced by his employment history and his 
responsibilities as a husband and father. Other than the incident under review, Applicant has performed his military and employment duties in a satisfactory or 
exemplary manner. Given his experience and training in handling and safeguarding classified information, coupled with the negative consequences from this 
incident, it is unlikely that Applicant will allow such an incident to occur again. At bottom, Applicant is a mature individual with a history of service to this 
country, both as a military officer and as a defense contractor. Based on the record evidence as a whole, he can be trusted to properly handle and safeguard 
classified information.  </SPAN></P> 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">To conclude, Applicant has met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Accordingly, both Guidelines K and E are decided 
for Applicant. In reaching my decision, I have considered the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate factors and guidelines 
in the Directive.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  </SPAN></P>
