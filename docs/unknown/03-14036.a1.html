  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Administrative Judge acted in good faith when issuing his decision.  Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence.  Given the record evidence, the Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline B are not  arbitrary or capricious.  It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Judge to conclude Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns raised by his ties to  immediate family members in the People's Republic of China.  Decisions by Hearing Office Judges are not legally binding precedents that must be followed in  other cases.  Adverse decision affirmed.</P>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-size: 11pt">William F. Savarino, Esq.</SPAN></P> 
<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 29, 2004, which stated the reasons why 
DOHA proposed to deny or revoke access to classified information for Applicant.  The SOR was based on Guideline B (Foreign Influence).  Administrative 
Judge Philip S. Howe  issued an unfavorable security clearance decision, dated December 13, 2004.</P> 
<P>Applicant appealed the Administrative Judge's unfavorable decision.  The Board has jurisdiction under Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended.</P> 
<P>The following issues have been raised on appeal: (1) whether the Administrative Judge rushed the decision in this case and overlooked important considerations 
and mitigating facts; (2) whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that the presence of Applicant's parents and in-laws in the PRC raised unmitigated 
security concerns under Guideline B is supported by the record evidence; (3) whether the Administrative Judge failed to articulate a sustainable basis for his 
formal finding against Applicant because of his wife's PRC citizenship; and  (4) whether the Administrative Judge failed to utilize the whole person concept in 
reaching his decision.  For the reasons that follow, the Board affirms the Administrative Judge's decision.</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Scope of Review</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>On appeal, the Board does not review a case <EM>de novo</EM>.  Rather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether there is factual 
or legal error.  There is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party must raise claims of error with specificity and identify how the Administrative 
Judge committed factual or legal error.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.  <EM>See also</EM> ISCR Case No. 00-0050 (July 23, 2001) at pp. 2-3 
(discussing reasons why party must raise claims of error with specificity).</P> 
<P>When the rulings or conclusions of an Administrative Judge are challenged, the Board must consider whether they are: (1) arbitrary or capricious; or (2) 
contrary to law.  Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Item E3.1.32.3.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, 
the Board will review the Judge's decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a satisfactory explanation for its 
conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of 
judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so 
implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere difference of opinion.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 97-0435 (July 14, 1998) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court 
decision).  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law, the Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of 
Executive Order 10865, the Directive, or other applicable federal law.  Compliance with state or local law is not required because security clearance 
adjudications are conducted by the Department of Defense pursuant to federal law.  <EM>See</EM> U.S. Constitution, Article VI, clause 2 (Supremacy Clause).  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, 
ISCR Case No. 00-0423 (June 8, 2001) at p. 3 (citing Supreme Court decisions).</P> 
<P>When an Administrative Judge's factual findings are challenged, the Board must determine whether "[t]he Administrative Judge's findings of fact are supported 
by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.  In 
making this review, the Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge."  Directive, Additional Procedural 
Guidance, Item E3.1.32.1.  The Board must consider not only whether there is record evidence supporting a Judge's findings, but also whether there is evidence 
that fairly detracts from the weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge's findings reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record 
evidence as a whole.  Although a Judge's credibility determination is not immune from review, the party challenging a Judge's credibility determination has a 
heavy burden on appeal.</P> 
<P>When an appeal issue raises a question of law, the Board's scope of review is plenary.  <EM>See</EM> DISCR Case No. 87-2107 (September 29, 1992) at pp. 4-5 (citing 
federal cases). </P> 
<P>If an appealing party demonstrates factual or legal error, then the Board must consider the following questions:</P> 
<P>Is the error harmful or harmless?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 00-0250 (July 11, 2001) at p. 6 (discussing harmless error doctrine);</P> 
<P>Has the nonappealing party made a persuasive argument for how the Administrative Judge's decision can be affirmed on alternate grounds?  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR 
Case No. 99-0454 (October 17, 2000) at p. 6 (citing federal cases); and</P> 
<P>If the Administrative Judge's decision cannot be affirmed, should the case be reversed or remanded?  (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, Items 
E3.1.33.2 and E3.1.33.3).</P> 
<P><CENTER><STRONG>Appeal Issues</STRONG></CENTER> 
</P> 
<P>1. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge rushed the decision in this case and overlooked important considerations and mitigating facts</SPAN>.  Applicant states that five 
months after the hearing the Administrative Judge had not issued a decision in his case.  Applicant further represents that after his lawyer contacted the DOHA 
Hearing Office to inquire about the status of the decision, the Judge then issued the decision in less than two weeks.  Applicant now complains on appeal that 
the Judge rushed his decision in response to the inquiry and the result was a decision that overlooked important aspects of the case and overlooked compelling 
mitigating evidence.</P> 
<P>Applicant's claims lack merit.  There is a rebuttable presumption that government officials carry out their duties in good faith, and a party seeking to rebut or 
overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of presenting clear evidence to the contrary.  <EM>See, e.g., National Archives and Records Administration v. Favish</EM>, 
541 U.S. 157, 174 (2004).  Moreover, there is a rebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge 
specifically states otherwise.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 99-9020 (June 4, 2001) at p. 2.  Applicant's strong disagreement with the Judge's findings and 
conclusions do not demonstrate the Judge made his findings of fact or reached his conclusions in a hasty or careless manner or rebut the presumption that the 
Judge carried out his duties in good faith.  Applicant fails to identify anything specific in the Judge's decision or in the record below that indicates or suggests a 
basis for a reasonable person to question the good faith of the Judge in this case.<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>2. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge's conclusion that the presence of Applicant's parents and in-laws in the PRC raised unmitigated security concerns under 
Guideline B is supported by the record evidence</SPAN>.  The Administrative Judge concluded that Department Counsel established by substantial evidence that 
Applicant's parents and his wife's parents are citizens of the People's Republic of China (PRC).  He then concluded that Guideline B Disqualifying Condition 
1<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> applied because these people are his immediate family members and they are in a foreign country.  The Judge went on to conclude that Guideline B 
itigating Condition 1<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> was not applicable because of the potential for exploitation of his parents and parents-in-law by the PRC government.  The Judge cited 
the fact that Applicant's parents were the victims of PRC policies during the Cultural Revolution as a basis for his conclusion.  The Judge also concluded that 
Applicant's contacts with his PRC relatives were not casual and were frequent enough to make Guideline B Mitigating Condition 3<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> inapplicable to the case.  
On appeal, Applicant asserts: (a) there is no basis in the record for the Judge to conclude that Applicant's relatives in the PRC are actually in a position to be 
exploited in a way that could force him to choose between loyalty to them and the United States; and (b) Applicant's contacts with his PRC relatives are casual 
and infrequent.  Applicant's arguments fail to establish error on the part of the Administrative Judge.</P> 
<P>The Administrative Judge concluded that the government had established a prima facie case  under Guideline B, Disqualifying Condition 1, and that conclusion 
is not challenged by Applicant on appeal.  Once facts raising security concerns under Guideline B were admitted by Applicant or proven by Department 
Counsel, the burden shifted to Applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances sufficient to warrant a favorable 
security clearance decision.<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A>  There is no right to a security clearance,<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> there is no presumption in favor of granting a security clearance,<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> a security clearance 
should not be granted unless there is an affirmative determination that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for a particular applicant,<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> and doubts must be resolved in favor of the national security.<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_9_"><SUP> (9)</SUP></A>  The Judge's conclusion that Applicant's PRC relatives were in a 
position to be exploited, thus precluding application of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1, is sustainable based on the record evidence.  Moreover, it was 
Applicant's burden to demonstrate that his relatives were not in a position to force him to choose between his loyalties to them and the United States.<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_10_"><SUP> (10)</SUP></A></P> 
<P>Concerning Guideline B Mitigating Condition 3, the Judge's conclusion that the record evidence precluded its application is sustainable.  The record evidence 
cited by Applicant did not compel the Administrative Judge, as a matter of law or logic, to conclude Applicant's contacts warranted application of Guideline B 
itigating Condition 3.</P> 
<P>3. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to articulate a sustainable basis for his formal finding against Applicant because of his wife's PRC citizenship</SPAN>.  
Subparagraph 1.a of the SOR alleged under Guideline B that Applicant's wife was a citizen of the PRC and currently resided with Applicant in his home.  The 
Administrative Judge made found that Applicant's wife was a citizen of the PRC who had applied for U.S. citizenship and expected to be granted such 
citizenship sometime in 2004.  He then made a formal finding under subparagraph 1.a of the SOR without any mention or discussion in the "Conclusions" 
section of his decision about Applicant's wife's PRC citizenship or the status of her pending application for U.S. citizenship.  On appeal, Applicant argues  that 
it is difficult to assess the impact, if any, that the nationality of the applicant's wife had on the Judge's decision, and the fact that Applicant's wife was close to 
receiving her citizenship at the time of the hearing and, in fact, has now been granted her U.S. citizenship are mitigating factors that were overlooked by the 
Judge.  Applicant asserts that these factors should be considered by the Board in determining whether the Judge's decision was arbitrary or capricious.<A HREF="03-14036.a1.html#N_11_"><SUP> (11)</SUP></A>    </P> 
<P>Applicant's argument that his wife's pending U.S. citizenship constituted a matter in mitigation is not persuasive.  There is nothing in the record evidence that 
required, as a matter of law, a conclusion that Applicant's wife's citizenship status was mitigating.  The security concerns raised by the presence of Applicant's 
wife's parents in the PRC are not extenuated or mitigated by her citizenship status.  Furthermore, the citizenship status of Applicant's wife does not extenuate 
or mitigate the security concerns raised by the presence of Applicant's parents in the PRC.</P> 
<P>4. <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Whether the Administrative Judge failed to utilize the whole person concept in reaching his decision</SPAN>.  Applicant makes various arguments in support of his 
general proposition that the Administrative Judge did not properly consider the whole person concept in reaching his decision.  These arguments are: (a) the 
Judge erroneously applied a per se "bright-line" test which resulted in the automatic determination  of Applicant because he has relatives in the PRC; and (b) 
the Judge's decision is inconsistent with the decisions of other DOHA Hearing Office Administrative Judges in similar cases and is inconsistent with his own 
prior decision in a case that is factually analogous to the instant case.</P> 
<P>Applicant's argument that the Administrative Judge's adverse decision is based solely on the fact that Applicant's relatives are PRC citizens is not persuasive.  
The Judge's adverse conclusions under Guideline B were not based merely upon the fact that Applicant's parents and in-laws are citizens of the PRC.  Rather, 
they were based on the record evidence that Applicant's ties with his foreign family members pose a security risk under the particular facts of this case.  The 
Board notes that this program has adjudicated Guideline B (Foreign Influence) cases involving applicants with ties to a wide variety of countries, not just the 
PRC.  Furthermore, whether an applicant with family ties to citizens of the PRC can mitigate the security concerns raised by such ties depends on the particular 
facts and circumstances of each applicant's case.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-09907 (March 17, 2004) at p. 10 n.9 (result of applicant's case does not decide, 
favorably or unfavorably, the outcome of all security clearance adjudications involving applicants with ties to family members in the PRC).  Furthermore, a 
review of the Judge's decision reveals that he considered evidence both favorable and unfavorable to Applicant.  Applicant's strong disagreement on appeal 
with the manner in which the Judge weighed the evidence does not demonstrate that the Judge employed a <EM>per se</EM>, "bright-line" test that ignored important 
aspects of the case, failed to employ the whole person concept, or that his decision was otherwise arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.</P> 
<P>Applicant cites to other decisions of DOHA Hearing Office Judges involving applicants with relatives in the PRC, including a case previously decided by the 
Judge in the instant case, for the proposition that the Judge did not employ the whole person concept in this case and that the case was wrongly decided.  
Decisions of individual Hearing Office Judges are not binding on other Hearing Office Judges, nor are they binding on the Appeal Board.  A party citing such a 
decision has the burden of demonstrating that the cited decision addressed similar or identical issues and facts, articulated a rational basis for its conclusions, 
relied on reasoning or analysis that can be applied to the facts and conclusions of the current case, relied on reasoning or analysis that is consistent with 
governing legal authorities, or that there are sound reasons the Board should follow the reasoning of the cited case.  <EM>See</EM>, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-22606 (June 
30, 2003) at pp. 3-5.  Accordingly, even if the Board were to conclude that the Judge's decision in this case was not consistent with the decisions by his 
colleagues in other DOHA cases that are cited by Applicant, such a conclusion would not require the Board to hold that the Judge's decision in this case was 
arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law or that the Judge failed to properly utilize the whole person concept.  Because the decisions of Hearing Office Judges are 
not legally binding precedent in other cases, neither a Hearing Office Judge nor the Board is required to distinguish them or justify why they are not persuasive 
authority.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 02-30941 (April 19, 2004) at p. 3.</P> 
<P>Applicant also cites an earlier case decided by the Administrative Judge in this case where the Judge reached the opposite conclusion regarding an applicant's 
security clearance eligibility based on a record that Applicant argues is closely analogous to the record in this case.  As a practical matter, the Board cannot 
review the record evidence in the other case and decide whether the Judge's decision in that case was supported by the record evidence as a whole or not, or is 
distinguishable from this case in some important aspect.  Moreover, the Judge's decision in the other case uses language that suggests the Judge engaged in an 
analysis that the Board has found to be arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law in other Guideline B cases.  If the Board were forced to decide how to reconcile 
the Judge's decision in the other case with the Judge's decision in this case, it would be more likely to conclude the decision in the other case was wrongly 
decided than to conclude the decision in this case was erroneous.</P>
