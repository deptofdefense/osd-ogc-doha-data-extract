<P>Applicant's possession, renewal, and use of a foreign passport after becoming a U.S. citizen demonstrated a foreign preference and was not mitigated where 
Applicant had neither surrendered the passport nor obtained formal approval for its use. Applicant was potentially subject to foreign influence where his parents 
and siblings are citizens and residents of Iran. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant appeals the 9 October 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) preliminarily denying his security 
clearance.<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> He answered the SOR on 13 November 2003 and requested an administrative decision on the record. He did not respond to the File of Relevant 
aterial, issued 13 February 2003. The record closed on 24 March 2004, the date the response was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 27 April 
2004. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant--a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor--seeks access to classified information. He has not previously held a clearance, but requires one to 
work on a future, otherwise undesignated, classified project.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in Iran--governed then by the Shah of Iran<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A>-- in 1956. He lived in Iran and was educated in Iran from 1956 to June 1975, completing 
industrial high school. He was drafted into the military and served as a cook in the Iranian Army from February 1976 to February 1978.  </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant came to the U.S. on a student visa in August 1978. He decided to stay in the U.S. and became a legal permanent resident (LPR) in 1986. However, he 
initially did not apply for U.S. citizenship when he first became eligible because he erroneously believed that he could not travel to Iran if he became a U.S. 
citizen. When he learned that he could to travel to Iran as a dual citizen, he became a U.S. citizen in March 1995, and obtained his U.S. passport in April 1995. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's central motivation was to ensure his ability to travel back to Iran. While stating that he considers himself only a U.S. citizen, he understands that 
Iran considers him only a citizen of Iran and that he can only enter Iran on an Iranian passport. Since coming to the U.S. in 1978, he has apparently traveled 
back to Iran on a regular basis, as he is close to his family.<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> He came to the U.S. in 1978 on an Iranian passport valid for 10 years. He renewed that passport in 
1988 for another 10 years. His Iranian passport had expired in 1998 when he had to return to Iran because of his father's illness. He renewed his Iranian 
passport in June 1998 when he had to travel to Iran to deal with his  father's illness. He traveled to Iran on his Iranian passport in July-August 1998, but also  
used it to travel to Iran in August 1999, December 2000, and December 2001. He intended to travel to Iran in December 2002.<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_4_"><SUP> (4)</SUP></A> In June 2002, he intended to 
retain his Iranian passport for at least another five years to ensure his ability to sell two properties in Iran and allow two of his sisters to immigrate to the U.S. 
He sponsored his two sisters for LPR status, but because they are in a different immigration category than his parents, they are not eligible to immigrate to the 
U.S. until 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">When Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he sponsored his parents for LPR status. His parents first came to the U.S. in November or December 1997, obtained 
their resident alien cards in January 1998 (to expire in January 2008), and returned to Iran in May 1998. They came back to the U.S. in November 2000 and 
stayed until June or July 2001. There is no evidence that they have been back to the U.S. since.<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_5_"><SUP> (5)</SUP></A> Applicant had been sending his parents $500.00 to 1,000.00 
per year financial support, but now asserts that he no longer does that. He was in the process of buying two properties in Iran in his father's name, expecting to 
get title in his name when the properties were paid for. He also expects to inherit from his father's estate.<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_6_"><SUP> (6)</SUP></A> Applicant now asserts that he is selling the two 
properties, but has provided no documentary evidence supporting that claim.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant has not surrendered his Iranian passport. Although he has stated a willingness to do so, he has not taken any steps to comply with the provisions of 
the Money Memo regarding foreign passports. He has not obtained U.S. Government approval for continued possession and/or use. Similarly, he has indicated 
a conditional willingness to renounce his Iranian  citizenship, but has taken no steps to renounce his citizenship. Iran is a fundamentalist Islamic republic with a 
poor human rights record and confrontational relations with the U.S.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A3.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P>

bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">On 16 August 2000, the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence (ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I) issued a memorandum<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_7_"><SUP> (7)</SUP></A> to clarify 
the application of Guideline C., Foreign Preference, to cases involving possession and/or use of a foreign passport. In pertinent part, the ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I memorandum 
</SPAN><STRONG>"requires that any clearance be denied or revoked unless the applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains official approval for its use from the 
appropriate agency of the United States Government." </STRONG>(Emphasis added).<SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P> <SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Although Applicant has been a dual citizen of Iran and the United States since his naturalization as a U.S. citizen  in 1995, his foreign citizenship possesses 
little security significance if based solely on his birth in a foreign country. For Applicant's conduct to fall within the security concerns of Guideline C, Foreign 
Preference, he must have acted in a way to indicate a preference for a foreign nation over the United States. However, inimical intent or detrimental impact on 
the interests of the United States is not required before the Government can seek to deny access under Guideline C. The Government has a compelling interest 
in ensuring those entrusted with this Nation's secrets will make decisions free of concerns for the foreign country of which they may also be a citizen. Under 
this assessment, I conclude the Government has established its case under Guideline C and Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant claims to prefer his U.S. citizenship, his conduct suggests otherwise. He spent the first twenty-two years of his life in Iran. When he came to 
the U.S. in 1978 to attend college, he cannot be said to have come with a clear intent to reside here permanently. Indeed, although he became an LPR in 1986, 
he refrained from becoming a U.S. citizen to ensure his ability to return to Iran, which he did frequently. Once he became a U.S. citizen, he maintained and used 
his Iranian citizenship (and his Iranian passport) to continue his travel to Iran.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The ASD, C<SUP>3</SUP>I Memorandum effectively resolves this case. The Memorandum states that Applicant's possession and use of his foreign passport can be 
mitigated only if Applicant surrenders the foreign passport or obtains U.S. Government approval for its use. Applicant has undertaken neither action. While the 
most recent passport known to the U.S. Government has expired, Applicant's earlier statements of intent to maintain and use his Iranian passport are more 
credible than his statements of intent to surrender the passport and renounce his Iranian citizenship.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">While Applicant has a legal right to maintain his dual citizenship with its attendant benefits and responsibilities, he has not demonstrated that he can be counted 
on to always act in preference to the United States. As a practical matter, he continues to owe allegiance to Iran where he has family ties. This presents an 
unacceptable risk that his future decisions will be influenced by concerns for Iran. I resolve Guideline C against Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">For similar reasons, Applicant appears to be vulnerable to foreign influence as alleged in the SOR. His father, mother, and siblings are citizens of Iran, and live 
in Iran. Applicant is close to his family as evidenced by his own statements and his travel back to Iran to visit them.<A HREF="02-32015.h1.html#N_8_"><SUP> (8)</SUP></A> He has sent financial support to his 
parents, purchased two properties in Iran through his father, and stands to inherit from his father's estate. Although, his parents are both LPRs of the U.S., they 
continue to reside in Iran, except for the statutory periods required by that status. Notwithstanding Applicant's representations that none of his family are agents 
of a foreign government, the record contains insufficient information about his family members to conclude that they do not constitute an unacceptable security 
risk as required by MC 1, particularly where I have concluded that Applicant has a preference for Iran in the first place. I resolve Guideline B against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
