<P>Applicant is potentially subject to foreign influence where her parents and brother are citizens and residents of the People's Republic of China (PRC), and 
where her husband is a citizen of the PRC who uses his PRC passport to travel to the PRC on business. Clearance denied.</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</SPAN></STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant challenges the 27 October 2003 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Statement of Reasons (SOR) </SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">recommending denial or revocation 
of her clearance.</SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><A HREF="02-29619.h1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A> She answered the SOR on 7 November 2003 and requested a decision without hearing. She did not respond to the File of Relevant Material, 
issued 11 March 2004. The record closed on 17 April 2004, the date the response was due at DOHA. The case was assigned to me on 28 April 2004.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"> </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">  <STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FINDINGS OF FACT</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant admitted the allegations of the SOR; accordingly I incorporate those admissions as findings of fact. A 40-year-old programmer/analyst for a defense 
contractor, seeks permanent access to classified information. She has held an interim clearance for three years.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant was born in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1963. She grew up in China, was educated there, and married there. Her son was born in the 
Netherlands in 1990 with derivative PRC citizenship. The son--a minor--became a legal permanent resident (LPR) of the U.S. in 2000 and will be eligible to 
become a U.S. citizen in 2005.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">It appears that Applicant and husband first came to the U.S. in approximately January 1993, when Applicant came to a major U.S. university to pursue her 
master's degree in engineering.<A HREF="02-29619.h1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> Beyond that, the circumstances of her immigration to the U.S. do not appear in the record. Applicant became a naturalized 
U.S. citizen in June 1999; she obtained her U.S. passport the following month.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's husband is a citizen of the PRC and a LPR of the U.S. Although he intends to reside permanently in the U.S., there is no evidence that he intends to 
become a U.S. citizen. He has had a PRC passport since 1985. He uses this passport to travel to the PRC for his employment, which requires him to meet with 
PRC governmental officials.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's parents and brother are citizens and residents of the PRC. She has regular contact with them and provides approximately $800.00 per year financial 
support to her parents. She traveled to the PRC in August 1999 to visit her family. It is not clear from the record what passport she used to travel to the PRC in 
1999 as she had both a valid U.S. and PRC passport at that time.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The PRC is a repressive, totalitarian government with foreign policy goals antithetical to the U.S. It has an active, effective intelligence service that targets U.S. 
intelligence and economic information, and operates against its citizens in the U.S. The PRC does not recognize dual citizenship of its citizens who become 
naturalized U.S. citizens.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant's supervisor reported that she is an excellent employee and that she has complied with both the letter and spirit of U.S. Government and company 
security policies during the three years she has had an interim clearance.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">POLICIES</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must 
take into account the conditions raising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.  Each adjudicative 
decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in Enclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for 
or against clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, 
as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, <EM>etc</EM>. </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Considering the evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors are most pertinent to this case:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><CENTER><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">FOREIGN INFLUENCE (CRITERION B)</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN> </CENTER> 
</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.1. The Concern:<EM> </EM>A security risk may exist when an individual's immediate family, including cohabitants, and other persons to whom he or she may be 
bound by affection, influence, or obligation are not citizens of the United States or may be subject to duress. These situations could result in the compromise of 
classified information. Contacts with citizens of other countries or financial interests in other countries are also relevant to security determinations if they make 
an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.2.1. An immediate family member, or a person to whom the individual has close ties of  affection or obligation, is a citizen of, or resident in, a foreign 
country;</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">E2.A2.1.3. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">None.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">Burden of Proof</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons. If the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion 
then shifts to the applicant to establish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to demonstrate that, despite the 
existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an 
applicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of 
the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with </SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">the U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the Government raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, 
reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant has a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted by the 
United States Supreme Court in <EM>Department of the Navy v. Egan</EM>, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials."</SPAN></P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><STRONG><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline">CONCLUSIONS</SPAN></STRONG></SPAN><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman"><SPAN STYLE="text-decoration: underline"></SPAN></SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">The Government established its case under Guideline B and the Applicant failed to mitigate the case against her, except regarding the citizenship of her son. He 
is an LPR of the U.S. and resides with Applicant in the U.S. As a minor, he could not become an LPR until age ten, which is when he became an LPR in 2000. 
He is eligible to become a U.S. citizen in 2005. He is clearly not an agent of the PRC and his residence in the U.S. makes it unlikely the PRC could use him to 
pressure Applicant. I resolve subparagraph 1.e. for Applicant.</SPAN></P> 
 
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-family: Times New Roman">Applicant lived a substantial portion of her adult life in the PRC. Her ties of obligation and affection to relatives in the PRC are clear. She maintains regular 
contact with her family and provides financial support to her parents. Her husband--a PRC citizen--travels to the PRC on a PRC passport to conduct his 
business with PRC governmental officials. The PRC is hostile to U.S. interests and conducts active intelligence operations against the U.S. The PRC is known 
to target its citizens residing abroad--regardless of their claimed citizenship--for purposes of obtaining sensitive information. Given the regularity of her 
contacts with family in the PRC and her husband's business travel there, Applicant has a heavy burden to establish that her family members or her husband's 
contacts are not agents of a foreign government or otherwise not in a position to be exploited, or in the case of her husband's contacts, in a position to exploit 
him or Applicant. Her evidence fails to overcome the Government's security concerns. I conclude Guideline B against Applicant.</SPAN></P>
