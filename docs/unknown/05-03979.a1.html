<P>The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On October 20, 2005, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the 
basis for that decision--security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On May 24, 2006, after the hearing, Administrative Judge James A. Young denied Applicant's request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely 
appealed pursuant to the Directive &para;&para; E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge erred by  concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline B had not been mitigated.<A HREF="05-03979.a1.html#N_1_"><SUP> (1)</SUP></A></P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the evidence he provided in the proceeding below was sufficient to require the Administrative Judge to conclude, as a matter of law, that he had rebutted, mitigated or 
extenuated the security concerns raised by the Guideline B (Foreign Influence) allegations.  Applicant is essentially contending that the Judge's adverse decision should be reversed because the 
Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1<A HREF="05-03979.a1.html#N_2_"><SUP> (2)</SUP></A> and 3,<A HREF="05-03979.a1.html#N_3_"><SUP> (3)</SUP></A> and made an unfavorable decision that is unsupported by the record as a whole.</P> 
 
<P>In this case, the Administrative Judge made sustainable findings that: (1) Applicant's parents, parents-in-law, and brother are citizens and residents of the People's Republic of Chine (PRC), (2) 
Applicant provides financial support of about $1,000 to $2,000 a year to his parents and speaks with them by telephone approximately once a month, (3) Applicant traveled to the PRC to visit his 
family and his wife's family in 1994, 2001, and 2004, and (4) the PRC is an authoritarian state, has a poor human rights record, is among the most active collectors of intelligence from U.S. sources, 
and is known to attempt to exploit U.S. citizens through their relatives in the PRC.  Given those findings, the Administrative Judge concluded that Applicant's ties with his family members in the 
PRC raised security concerns under Guideline B and that Disqualifying Condition 1 applied.  That conclusion shifted the burden of persuasion to Applicant.  If there are admitted or proven facts and 
circumstances that raise security concerns, "[t]he applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision." Directive &para; E3.1.15.</P> 
 
<P>Applicant argues that the Administrative Judge erred in not applying Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3, in that the Judge gave insufficient weight to evidence that Applicant has lived in the 
United States for many years, has extensive ties to this country, and does not have strong ties to his relatives in the PRC.  Applicant's arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge erred.</P> 
 
<P>The application of Adjudicative Guidelines disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them applies to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, the 
application of a disqualifying or mitigating condition requires the exercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.  <EM>See, e.g.</EM>, ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 
2003).  As the trier of fact, the Administrative Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or <EM>vice versa</EM>.  Applicant's 
disagreement with the Judge's weighing of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.</P> 
 
<P>Given the record in this case, it was not arbitrary and capricious for the Administrative Judge to conclude that Applicant had not met his burden of demonstrating that his contacts with his family 
members in the PRC were casual and infrequent, and that his family members were not in a position to be exploited by a foreign power in a way that could force the Applicant to choose between 
loyalty to them and the U.S.  A review of the Judge's decision indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying 
circumstances, and considered the possible application of relevant mitigating conditions and factors.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for not favorably applying any mitigating conditions or 
factors and reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government's security concerns.  The Judge was not required, 
as a matter of law, to favorably apply Guideline B Mitigating Conditions 1 and 3, and the Judge's overall adverse security clearance decision is sustainable.</P>
