<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Applicant is a 34-year-old consultant with a defense contractor. For more than 15 years, he routinely stole small items or small amounts of money from family, 
friends and employers. He has made monetary restitution on one occasion and returned stolen items twice. He has retained most of the money stolen and the 
benefit of the goods taken by him. Since he has not demonstrated that he is rehabilitated, he has not overcome the government's concerns about his personal 
conduct. Clearance is denied.<BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>STATEMENT OF THE CASE</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>On November 3, 2005, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within 
Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), of the Directive. DOHA 
recommended the case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. On November 
28, 2005, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant with a complete copy on February 10, 2006. Applicant had 30 days 
from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response or additional evidence. 
This case was assigned to me on April 7, 2006.<BR>

<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FINDINGS OF FACT</STRONG></P>

<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>POLICIES</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in the evaluation of security suitability. An administrative judge need 
not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines, when 
applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the adjudicative process provision in Paragraph E2.2., Enclosure 2 of the Directive, are intended to assist the 
administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. <BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Included in the guidelines are disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions applicable to each specific guideline. Although the presence or absence of a 
particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be 
measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security clearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the 
whole-person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of 
participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_33_"><SUP> (33)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for an applicant.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_34_"><SUP> (34)</SUP></A> The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_35_"><SUP> (35)</SUP></A> The burden of proof is something less than a preponderance of the 
evidence.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_36_"><SUP> (36)</SUP></A>Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome 
the case against him.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_37_"><SUP> (37)</SUP></A> Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_38_"><SUP> (38)</SUP></A><BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>No one has a right to a security clearance,<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_39_"><SUP> (39)</SUP></A> and "the clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials."<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_40_"><SUP> (40)</SUP></A> Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting 
such sensitive information.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_41_"><SUP> (41)</SUP></A> Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be "in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned." The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not 
necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and patriotism of an applicant.<A HREF="05-05023.h1.html#N_42_"><SUP> (42)</SUP></A> It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Based upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative guideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P><STRONG>Personal Conduct - Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulation could indicate that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.</STRONG><BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>CONCLUSIONS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate adjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the 
allegations set forth in the SOR:<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>The government has established its case under Guideline E. From 1987 through 2004 Applicant stole money or goods belonging to others for his own use. He 
took items belonging to family, friends and employers, and exploited those fiduciary relationships. Applicant has shown a pattern of rule violations under 
Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) E2.A5.1.2.5. (A pattern of dishonesty or rule violations).<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P>Although the police detained him for questioning on two occasions, he was never criminally charged for any of his conduct. He has made restitution in one 
incident only after being confronted by the police. He also returned two pieces of property, but has not returned any of the other property or stolen money, 
which is valued between $4300.00 and $5700.00. His repeated incidents of petty theft indicate a pattern of dishonest conduct over a long period of time. He 
knew stealing was wrong, but consciously chose to take money or goods belonging to others. Although the value of the property taken and the amount of money 
stolen at any one time is small, the accumulated value is a significant. His conduct raises questions about his honesty and trustworthiness. He has not presented 
convincing evidence that he is rehabilitated or would not steal again. Thus, he has not mitigated the government's concerns about his security worthiness. 
Accordingly, for the reasons stated, I find that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance to Applicant.<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
</P> 
 
<P STYLE="text-align: CENTER"><STRONG>FORMAL FINDINGS</STRONG></P> 
<BR> 
<BR> 
 
<P>Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:<BR>
