Duffy, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on April 7, 2010. On April 22, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) implemented on September 1, 2006.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue Applicant’s security clearance. On May 20, 2011, Applicant answered the 
SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 9, 2011. DOHA 
issued the Notice of Hearing on August 24, 2011. The hearing was held as scheduled 
on September 13, 2011. Department Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 that 
were admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel’s list of exhibits was 
marked as hearing exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A through 
O that were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was left open until 
October 3, 2011, for the Applicant to submit additional matters. Applicant submitted AE 
P through AB that were admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel’s 
email indicating he had no objection to Applicant’s post-hearing submission was marked 
as HE 2. The transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on September 19, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for 
that contractor since March 2010. She was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 1999. She 
is married and has two children, ages six and nine. This is the first time that she is 
seeking to obtain a security clearance.1 
 
The SOR listed eight delinquent debts totaling $40,523. In her Answer to the 
SOR, Applicant admitted each of the delinquent debts with comments. Her admissions 
are incorporated as findings as fact.2 
 
From October 2000 to June 2006, Applicant worked at an assisted living home. 
She left that job to raise her two children who were then six months and four years old. 
At that time, her husband, who was a realtor, became the sole source of income for the 
family. Her husband was a partner with another individual in a real estate business. In 
about 2005, his annual income was approximately $108,000, and he had 10 to 12 real 
estate closings a month. In 2006, they had no financial problems and purchased a 
larger home. Based on growth projections for the local economy arising from the Base 
Realignment Commission’s recommendations, they thought his business would 
continue to prosper. The local real estate market, however, fell into a slump starting in 
2006, and his real estate closings fell eventually to about one or two a month. This 
economic downturn had a significant impact on their income. Applicant estimated that 
her husband’s income decreased by 60 to 70 percent. During this economic downturn, 
she and her husband cut back on their expenses and she began working part-time as a 
bartender. She also worked part-time at another job in November 2009 and started her 
fulltime job with her current employer in March 2010. Her husband began working a 
second job in the spring of 2011. After 2006, Applicant and her family experienced

some medical problems, and they did not have medical insurance to cover the 
expenses. In her Answer to the SOR, she indicated she and her husband had been 
living outside of their means. At the hearing, she also stated that one reason for her 
delinquent debts was her lack of organization and follow-though.3 
 
Each of the delinquent debts in addressed separately below. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax lien for $34,494. Applicant’s tax 
deficiency arose from her husband’s business. This deficiency is for tax periods 2005 
through 2008. The tax lien was filed in August 2009. In March 2011, Applicant and her 
husband entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in which they agreed to 
make monthly payments of $850 starting on May 6, 2011, and continuing on the 6th of 
each month thereafter. The agreement indicated that the amount owed was $42,849. At 
the hearing, she provided documentation showing she made a payment of $850 on 
September 9, 2011. She indicated that she was unable to make earlier payments 
because she was making payments on other debts. In her post-hearing submission, she 
provided proof of another $850 payment made on September 26, 2011. She indicated 
that she would continue making payments monthly thereafter.4 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – medical debt for $1,010. This debt was listed for collection in May 
2010. In her Answer, Applicant indicated that she entered into a settlement arrangement 
to pay $350 in June 2010 and thereafter pay $100 per month for the next seven months. 
Her bank records reveal that she paid the creditor $353 on June13, 2011; $110 on July 
11, 2011; $100 on August 22, 2011; and $100 on September 12, 2011. This debt is 
being resolved.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – medical debt for $98. Applicant indicated that the amount of this 
debt was $198. It was incurred in October 2009. It was paid off in March 2011. This debt 
is resolved.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – medical debt for $1,487. The collection agency that handled the 
debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is also handling this debt, which was listed for collection in 
September 2009. In her Answer, Applicant indicated that she is currently paying $50 per 
month on this debt. She stated that she has maintained close contact with the collection 
agency and has a good relationship with it. The collection agency’s records reflect that 
she made a payment of $100 on August 20, 2010, and $50 payments on February 21, 
2011; March 18, 2011; April 18, 2011; April 30, 2011; May 31, 2011; June 30, 2011; 
July 29, 2011; August 31, 2011; and October 1, 2011. As of September 12, 2011, she

owes $1,235 on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d and $300 on another medical debt. The 
collection agency has indicated that these accounts are in good standing. This debt is 
being resolved.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – collection account for $1,249. This collection account was opened in 
May 2010. In February 2011, Applicant entered into a settlement agreement with the 
collection agency. According to that agreement, she is required to pay a total of $883 to 
settle this debt. She was obligated to pay $50 in February 2011 and $104 monthly 
thereafter until the debt was paid. Her bank records reveal that she made payments to 
this creditor of $50 on February 28, 2011, and of $104 on March 21, 2011; April 18, 
2011; July 25, 2011; August 22, 2011; and September 19, 2011. She testified that the 
remaining balance would be paid in October 2011. This debt is being resolved.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account for $1,879. This account was charged-off by the 
original creditor in August 2009. In her Answer, Applicant stated that she has been 
making payments of $100 to the collection agency for the last three months (March – 
May 2011). Her bank records reveal that she made payments of $105 to this creditor on 
March 21, 2011; April 19, 2011; May 19, 2011; June 21, 2011; July 19, 2011; and 
August 19, 2011. She also made payments of $234 on August 31, 2011 and September 
19, 2011. In her post-hearing submission, she provided documentation showing the 
creditor considered this debt paid as of September 24, 2011. This debt is resolved.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g – charged-off account for $83. The date of first delinquency/date of 
last activity on this account was October 2005. In her Answer, Applicant admitted this 
debt, but stated it was an annual fee that was applied to her account after she 
voluntarily closed it. She stated that she felt this was an unfair charge. She testified that 
she called the creditor recently and was informed they could not find any information 
about this debt. In her post-hearing submission, she provided documentation showing 
that she paid this debt on October 3, 2011. This debt is resolved.10 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h – medical account for $205. This collection account was opened in 
August 2008. In her Answer, Applicant admitted that she owes this debt, but indicated 
that she could not find the creditor. She stated that she would take care of this debt as 
soon as she locates the creditor. At the hearing, she indicated she thought this debt was 
to a local hospital. When asked if she contacted the hospital, she stated that she had 
                                                          
7 Tr.35-36; Applicant’s Answer to the SOR; GE 2-5; AE W, AB. On March 18, 2011, Applicant

and remaining $48 went towards the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d.

AE AB, she failed to note that she made a payment of $104 on this debt on August 22, 2011. See AE O.

not contacted it. In her post-hearing submission, she indicated that she has made an 
arrangement to pay this debt on October 31, 2011. This debt is not resolved.11 
 
In the summer of 2009, Applicant received financial counseling from an 
accountant who provided her information on budgeting and suggested she go back to 
work. At the time of the hearing, her net monthly income was about $2,600. She 
testified that her and her husband’s combined net monthly income was about $6,000, 
but she indicated their monthly income varies. She provided a monthly household 
budget that reported their expenses and debt payments were approximately $4,265. 
Those monthly expenses and debt payments did not include the $850 monthly payment 
to the IRS. Her and her husband’s cars have been paid off. She has a student loan that 
will come out of forbearance in October 2011. She intends to make monthly payments 
of $120 on the student loan, but indicated the required minimum payment was $75.12 
 
Applicant is meeting her current monthly financial obligations. Recently, she 
made significant strides in resolving debts that were not alleged in the SOR. She and 
her husband paid off his vehicle loan in August 2011. Their monthly payments on that 
vehicle were about $300. In August 2011, they also made a final payment of $2,000 on 
a credit card debt for which they were making monthly payments of $300. In September 
2011, they paid off a state tax deficiency of $2,397. In September 2011, they also paid 
off the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f for which they were making monthly payments of $105. The 
resolution of these debts will free up money for her to make the IRS payments. She has 
indicated that she is committed to getting her finances under control and has every 
intention of paying off her debts. At the hearing, she was open and honest about her 
financial situation. I found her testimony was candid and forthright.13 
 
Nine coworkers, including supervisors, have written letters of reference on 
Applicant’s behalf. They described her as honest, hard-working, and trustworthy.14 As 
an example of their statements, one coworker stated, 
 
[Applicant] is an individual of unquestioned loyalty and impeccable 
integrity. She is diligent, conscientious, and adept at her duties. 
Additionally, I found that [Applicant] is a woman of high moral character 
who will always choose the hard right over the easy wrong. Patriotic, 
reliable, and displaying an unmatched initiative, [Applicant] is one of the 
most hard working and productive employees in the office. In short,

[Applicant] is the kind of individual who embraces responsibility and

Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
                                                          
15 AE N.

Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated delinquent debts totaling over $40,000 that she has been 
unable or unwilling to satisfy for a number of years. This evidence is sufficient to raise 
the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
8 
 
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a 
procedure designed to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.16 
An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he or she has resolved 
every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the 
financial problems and take sufficient action to implement the plan. There is no 
requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor 
is there a requirement that the debt alleged in the SOR be paid first.17 
 
In 2006, Applicant and her husband were financially stable. He was earning over 
$100,000 per year. At that time, she left her job to raise their children. Soon thereafter, 
the housing market collapsed. AG ¶ 20(b) applies in part because this economic 
downturn was a condition beyond their control that resulted in a 60 to 70 percent 
decrease in his income as a realtor. She does not receive full credit under AG ¶ 20(b) 
because she admitted that she was living outside of her means and indicated that her 
lack of organization and follow-though was one of the reasons for her delinquent debts. 
Nevertheless, Applicant and her husband have turned the corner on their financial 
problems. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are applicable. In 2009, they received financial 
counseling. She returned to work in November 2009. Her husband obtained a second job 
in the spring of 2011. They cut back on their expenses. In the past year, they have been 
working hard at paying their delinquent debts. She has resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 
1.f, and 1.g. There are clear indications that the debts in SOR 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e will be 
                                                          
16 See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). 
17 See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).

resolved soon. Although Applicant and her husband entered into a settlement agreement 
with the IRS for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a in March 2011, they have only made two of the five 
payments that were due before the hearing under that plan. She indicated that she was 
unable to make those missed payments because she was making payments on other 
delinquent debts. Bank records support her claim. With the recent resolution of a number 
of her debts, she will have money available to make the IRS payments. I found credible 
and convincing her statement that she is committed to resolving each of these debts. 
Most significantly, she has established a plan for resolving her debts and has taken 
sufficient action to implement that plan. In short, I find that AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) apply 
and that AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) partially apply. 
 
Applicant did not dispute any of the delinquent debts. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant’s service to her employer has been exceptional. Nine of her coworkers, 
including supervisors, had expressed great trust and confidence in her. She has 
encountered financial difficulties, but she has taken meaningful steps in addressing 
those problems. She is committed to resolving her financial problems and is on the right 
track to do so. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts 
about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.h:  For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance 
for Applicant. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
