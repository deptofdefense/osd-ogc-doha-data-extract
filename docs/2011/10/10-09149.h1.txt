GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 6, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on an unspecified date, and the parties agreed to adopt the date as July 
13, 2011 - the date of the hearing.2
                                                          
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated May 6, 2010. 
 On March 25, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified

Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on March 31, 2011. In a sworn statement, dated 
April 12, 2011, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel indicated the Government was 
prepared to proceed on May 11, 2011, and the case was assigned to me on May 25, 
2011. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 24, 2011, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on July 13, 2011. 
 
 During the hearing, three Government exhibits (GE 1-3) and one Applicant 
exhibit (AE A) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The 
hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on July 25, 2011. The record was kept open until 
July 29, 2011, to enable Applicant to supplement it, and he submitted 13 additional 
exhibits which were admitted as Applicant exhibits (AE B-N), without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a majority of the factual allegations 
(¶¶ 1.b. through 1.l.) of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegation (¶ 1.a.) of the SOR. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:3
 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a senior project engineer and quality manager - assembly processor.4 He is seeking to 
obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been revealed. He previously 
held a security clearance in 1979 for a period of one or two years.5
                                                          
3 I have read all of the documents generated by Applicant, including his SF 86, Personal Subject Interview, 
his Answer to the SOR, his Answers to the Interrogatories, and various letters from him, and I have listened to his 
testimony. Unfortunately, pertaining to various dates and events, Applicant’s evidence is very inconsistent. Specific 
dates and events that he periodically refers to in one source differ from dates and events appearing in other sources. 
He has acknowledged misstatements regarding dates and events. See Applicant Exhibit L (E-mail from Applicant, 
dated July 29, 2011). Accordingly, I have concluded that except where a date or event is confirmed by a source 
document generated by third parties, the dates and events furnished by Applicant are nothing but unreliable 
guesstimates. 
  Applicant attended

a college preparatory school for several years, but did not graduate.6 After attending a 
vocational school, with some evening college courses, he received a degree in aviation 
maintenance technology and a power plant air frame license in 1978.7 Attending night 
school from about 1980, Applicant eventually obtained a B.A. degree in business 
administration in 1994.8 He has held several different positions with various employers. 
He was with one company for 13 years in an unspecified capacity, commencing in 
1979.9 In addition, Applicant was an engineer from January 2001 until he was laid off in 
about January 2003; a senior engineer from January 2003 until January 2006; a project 
engineer from January 2006 until January 2007; and a senior design engineer from 
January 2007 until he was again laid off in about December 2008.10 He joined his 
current employer in May 2009.11 Applicant has never served with the U.S. military.12 He 
was married in July 1981 and divorced in April 1996.13 That marriage produced two 
children: a daughter born in 1984, and a son born in 1992.14 He has cohabited with his 
girlfriend since December 2009.15
 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In June 2010, Applicant contended his personal financial issues commenced in 
early January 2009 when he was laid off and he had insufficient funds in his savings to 
pay his bills.16 Although he received an unspecified monthly unemployment 
compensation payment, that sum was insufficient to cover all of his personal “basic 
necessities.”17 During the hearing, Applicant conceded his financial problems started 
earlier than previously stated. He acknowledged that before he was laid off, his credit 
cards were getting close to being “maxed out.”18
                                                          
 
 He added: “I was irresponsible with my

spending.”19 He spent his money on household goods and family-related, as well as 
girlfriend-related expenses. His girlfriend had a very minimal job, and her eldest, newly 
divorced daughter and two grandchildren moved in with Applicant and his girlfriend.20 
Applicant claimed he “needed new air conditioning for the home, needed new 
appliances, (and) many upgrades.”21
 
 Although he lived off his credit cards, a small IRA 
account, and his unemployment stipend for about six months before obtaining his 
current employment, his accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or 
charged off. His child support payments fell into arrearage, and his residence went into 
a foreclosure status. 
In June 2010, Applicant informed an investigator with the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM) that he was “currently” working on bringing his accounts 
to current status, and intended to resolve all of his delinquent accounts no later than 
September 30, 2010.22
 
 He failed to meet his goal. 
The SOR identified 12 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by a 
credit report from 2010.23
 
 Included in the SOR are a home mortgage in the amount of 
$250,578, of which $15,388 is past due; and various credit cards, charge accounts, 
medical accounts, and a cell phone account, totaling approximately $56,950. Some 
accounts reflected in the credit report have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to 
other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly, in many 
instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or 
under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by complete account 
numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some instances 
eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. The information 
reflected in the credit report is not necessarily accurate or up to date.  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): Unable to handle his monthly mortgage payment without his salary, 
Applicant applied for a mortgage loan modification.24 The events as described by 
Applicant are confusing and at odds with the available documentary evidence. 
According to Applicant, in September 2009, he was accepted into the trial period and 
made monthly payments of $1,300 for three months.25 However, a trial plan agreement 
was presented to Applicant in October 2010, and it called for three payments of 
$1,240.22, commencing in November 2010 and ending in January 2011.26

Nevertheless, according to Applicant, in April 2010, the bank purportedly informed him 
that the loan modification had been denied.27 It is unclear if Applicant continued to make 
any further monthly mortgage payments since he made the last payment under the trial 
period. In May 2011, the bank granted Applicant the loan modification.28 Under the 
modification, the new principal balance became $135,275.26, and a new monthly 
mortgage payment, commencing June 1, 2011, became $1,053.60.29 As of the closing 
of the record, Applicant offered no documentation to support any monthly mortgage 
payments made since the loan modification went into effect.30
 
  
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.f., 1.h., and 1.j. through 1.l.): As noted above, during his 
period of unemployment and before, Applicant increased the balances on various credit 
cards, charge accounts, medical accounts, and a cell phone account. The unpaid 
balances on those accounts run from as little as $165 to as high as $21,611. He has 
made no effort to make any payments on any of delinquent accounts,31 claiming that his 
sole concentration has been on regaining his residence.32 He also acknowledged that it 
would not have created a hardship on him to have paid the smaller account balances.33 
He does, however, now contend that, with the exception of the cell phone company, he 
contacted the various creditors or collection agents, and they are supposedly willing to 
reduce the outstanding balances by 50 percent.34 He has offered no documentary 
evidence to support his contentions, and has made no discernible efforts to enter into 
repayment arrangements with those creditors. Interestingly, Applicant’s earlier 
contention was that the mortgage lender had agreed to pay off his delinquent 
homeowners association (HOA) fees, but since it failed to do so, that money, when 
received, will be used to pay all of these delinquent accounts.35
 
 There is no evidence to 
support Applicant’s contention. 
The account with the cell phone company (SOR ¶ 1.j.) is slightly different. 
Applicant purchased the cell phone and plan for his girlfriend’s 26-year-old son as a 
Christmas gift. When the first bill was received the following January, the balance was

supposedly $2,000.36 Applicant was less than pleased, and when he sought relief from 
the cell phone company, and no satisfactory agreement could be reached, Applicant 
cancelled the plan.37 Doing so added cancellation fees to the outstanding balance.38 
Applicant claims promises were made by the company, but not kept, so he informally 
disputed the amount and disavowed responsibility for it. He has submitted no evidence 
of a formal dispute, has made no effort to contact the creditor since his earlier 
discussions, and has made no effort to make any payments.39
 
 
 (SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.i): Unlike Applicant’s actions pertaining to his other credit 
cards and charge accounts, Applicant contends he did make two payments of $100 on 
one account and an unspecified number of $57.50 payments on the other account.40 
However, it appears that Applicant made his last payment of $175 on one account in 
November 2009, and his last payment of $54 on the other account in December 2010.41
 
 
He has offered no documentary evidence to support his contentions regarding more 
recent contacts with the creditors or payments purportedly made, and has made no 
discernible efforts to enter into continuing repayment arrangements with those creditors.  
 In July 13, 2011, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
monthly net income of approximately $4,238, including a $300 pension42 which is 
anticipated to commence in August 2011, and monthly expenses of approximately 
$840, not including any mortgage payments.43 He referred to unspecified unsecured 
credit debt and delinquent medical bills, along with an estimated monthly mortgage 
payment projected to be $1,000, but failed to estimate a monthly remainder, if any, 
available for discretionary spending.44 At that time, he reflected $1,000 in savings and a 
$20,000 share in a boat.45 During the hearing, he stated his annual salary was 
$72,000,46
                                                          
 
 and acknowledged he had not made any payments on more than $3,000 in 
36 Tr. at 52. The actual past-due balance was $1,854. See Government Exhibit 2 (Equifax Credit Report,

non-SOR medical bills.47 By selling a one-half interest in his boat for $20,000, Applicant 
was able to pay off the HOA arrearage of approximately $17,000 by December 31, 
2010.48 He also satisfied his child support arrearage. Effective August 5, 2011, 
Applicant received a $4,200 annual increase.49
 
  
Applicant realizes a monthly remainder of approximately $2,000 available for 
discretionary use such as paying bills or saving.50 When asked how long it is 
appropriate to simply say, “I’m going to take care of it (paying delinquent accounts), but 
not taking care of it?” Applicant replied “I think I’ve been very irresponsible. . . .”51
 
 
Applicant stated that when his financial issues started, he called a debt counselor 
who wanted a payment up-front, so no agreement was ever established.52 He did 
receive some guidance from another source with respect to the loan modification 
program.53
 
 There is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling on 
money management, debt management, debt consolidation, or repayment plans. 
Work Performance and Character Reference 
 
Applicant’s supervisor has known Applicant for close to 30 years and over that 
period they have worked together at three companies. It is his opinion that Applicant 
would never allow his personal situation to compromise his job or allow it to be used 
against him.54
 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”55

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”56
 
   
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”57 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.58
 
  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”59

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”60
 
 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until 2008 when his income proved to be insufficient to handle his monthly 
expenses. He acknowledged that before he was laid off in January 2009, his credit 
cards were getting close to being “maxed out.” He was irresponsible with his spending. 
For about six months before obtaining his current employment, Applicant’s accounts 
became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. His child support 
payments fell into arrearage, and his residence went into a foreclosure status. AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of

employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”61
 
  
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 2008. Applicant 
attributed his financial problems to one main cause: his nearly six-month period of 
unemployment commencing with his lay-off in January 2009. However, while that event 
was a contributor to his financial problems, there were, in fact, additional substantial 
causes: 1) he was irresponsible with his spending, even before the lay-off, claiming he 
needed new air conditioning for the home, needed new appliances, and many 
upgrades; 2) his decision to concentrate solely on saving his residence, to the exclusion 
of any of his other accounts; and 3) he undertook financial responsibility for his 
girlfriend’s eldest, newly divorced daughter and two grandchildren. Applicant’s financial 
resources proved to be insufficient to handle his monthly expenses. While the lay-off 
and unemployment were unexpected and beyond Applicant’s control, the degree to 
which those factors had an impact on Applicant’s ability to overcome them has not been 
adequately explained. Applicant had unemployment compensation, a small IRA, and a 
boat while he was unemployed. Even after he was once again among the employed, 
making an annual salary of $72,000, he resolved only one SOR account (the residence 
foreclosure that was accepted into the loan modification program) and two non-SOR 
accounts (the child support arrearage and the HOA arrearage), but he has effectively 
ignored all of the other accounts.  
 
The SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts, but there were actually others that 
were not alleged. Applicant’s response to most of the accounts was to ignore them, 
explaining that he was concentrating on saving his residence. But concentrating on a 
mortgage loan modification does not excuse ignoring most other debts. While he was 
unhappy over the cell phone account, the account was his responsibility. Other than the 
three accounts that were resolved, Applicant has only made promises of his intention to 
address the remaining accounts. First there was the promise to the OPM investigator to 
resolve his accounts by September 30, 2010. That was followed by other promises to 
                                                          
61 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

resolve them. The most recent explanation was that there were offers from each of the 
SOR creditors to accept 50 percent on the accounts. In reality, the promises were 
meaningless and there has been little good-faith efforts made by Applicant to address 
the remaining 11 SOR accounts.  
 
Applicant has continued to accrue salary from his employer, and, effective 
August 1, 2011, a small pension from an earlier employer. His monthly income is 
seemingly capable of meeting most of his financial obligations. He simply decided not to 
pay his creditors. He has an estimated $2,000 per month available for discretionary use, 
which could be used to resolve his other delinquent accounts, Applicant has, instead, 
chosen to put it away, rather than use it.  
 
Some of what occurred was beyond Applicant’s control and took place under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Other than some generic guidance 
pertaining to mortgage loan modification, there is no evidence of financial counseling, 
debt management, or debt repayment. There is little indication that the problems 
associated with his delinquent accounts are now being resolved. By failing to make 
more than minimal good-faith efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts since 2008, 
Applicant acted irresponsibly under the circumstances, and his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment, are in question. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not 
apply. AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the various aspects of 
this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a 
piecemeal analysis.62

Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He 
experienced financial problems because his income diminished with his lay-off and 
nearly six-month period of unemployment. He successfully obtained a mortgage loan 
modification from his mortgage lender and paid off two non-SOR accounts.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:63
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
 
There are substantially more questionable actions by Applicant in handling his 
delinquent accounts. For whatever reason, Applicant made a decision to stop paying his 
monthly accounts and chose, instead, to concentrate on saving his residence. While his 
intentions and efforts are understandable, his failure to address his other accounts is 
not. His contention was that the mortgage lender had agreed to pay off his delinquent 
HOA fees, but since it failed to do so, that money, when received, will be used to pay all 
of his other delinquent accounts. There is no evidence to support Applicant’s contention. 
Now, he claims his creditors are willing to accept 50 percent of the delinquent balances, 
but once again, there is no documentary evidence to support his claim. Applicant has 
acknowledged that he has been very irresponsible in his handling of his 11 remaining 
SOR accounts, as well as his non-SOR accounts. Applicant’s track record for debt 
reduction reveals no meaningful plan to accomplish his repeatedly promised goals. 
Instead, his track record is primarily one of unfulfilled promises and inaction. I conclude 
that Applicant has failed to establish a meaningful track record. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I

considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.k:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.l:    Against Applicant 
       
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
