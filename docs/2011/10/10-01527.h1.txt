HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists nine debts totaling $30,816. After 
crediting him for paying one debt for $933 and filing bankruptcy, there is insufficient 
information to fully mitigate financial considerations because of his history of financial 
problems. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 4, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (hereinafter SF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On 
June 15, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
him, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) (Hearing 
Exhibit (HE) 1). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005. The SOR detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
for him, and it recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
On June 23, 2011, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On July 22, 2011, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On August 1, 2011, the case was 
assigned to me. On September 6, 2011, DOHA issued a hearing notice setting the 
hearing for September 27, 2011. (HE 2) The hearing was held as scheduled. At the 
hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits (GE 1-8) (Transcript (Tr.) 15), and 
Applicant offered one exhibit. (Tr. 16-17; AE A) I admitted GE 1-8 and AE A. (Tr. 15, 17) 
Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR, and the hearing notice. (HE 1-3) 
On October 12, 2011, I received the hearing transcript.   
 
Findings of Fact1
 
 
Applicant admitted responsibility for the eight debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.h 
and denied responsibility for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i. (HE 3) His admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I 
make the following additional findings of fact.   
 
 Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, who is seeking 
reinstatement of his security clearance to enable him to continue employment as a 
command and control room monitor. (Tr. 5; GE 1 at 18) In 1996, he graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 5) In about 2006, he earned an associate’s degree in computer science. (Tr. 
6; GE 1 at 14) From about December 2006 to about September 2009, he worked as a 
systems engineer for a telecommunications corporation. (GE 1 at 19) He has never 
served in the military. (GE 1 at 26) He has never married. (GE 1 at 29) He does not 
have any children. (GE 1 at 29-32) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges nine debts totaling $30,816 as follows: 1.a is a collection 
account from a bank for $2,672; 1.b is a collection account from a bank for $3,351; 1.c 
is a charged off account for a bank debt for $3,693; 1.d is a collection account for 
$4,316; 1.e is a collection account for $954; 1.f is a mortgage account, alleging a 
delinquent debt for $14,000; 1.g is a collection account for a telecommunications debt 
for $329; 1.h is a collection account for a telecommunications debt for $568; and 1.i is 
an alleged delinquent federal tax debt for $933. (HE 1)  
 
On February 1, 2011, Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($933) when the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) diverted or garnished part of his income tax refund for 
tax year 2010. (Tr. 19) His delinquent income tax bill was from his 2008 taxes. (Tr. 20)  
 
                                            
1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations 
in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. 
Unless stated otherwise, the sources for the facts in this section are Applicant’s SF-86 (GE 1) or his 
investigative personal subject interview (PSI). (GE 2)

Applicant said that after July 2008 he made some payments on some of his 
debts that were listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.h; however, he did not provide any 
documentary evidence to corroborate his claim of payments. (Tr. 39) The only 
documentation he provided at his hearing was one page to show he had filed for 
bankruptcy. (AE A)  
 
On August 18, 2011, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the 
Bankruptcy Code. (AE A) He said he listed all of his SOR debts on his bankruptcy filing. 
(Tr. 21) He paid his bankruptcy attorney $2,000 to file his case. (Tr. 26) He had one 
credit card that was current when he filed for bankruptcy, and its balance was about 
$500. (Tr. 44) He waited to file his bankruptcy because he was worried that he would 
lose his security clearance. (Tr. 56) His security office advised Applicant that filing 
bankruptcy would not automatically result in the loss of his security clearance. (Tr. 56) 
After receiving this advice, he filed for bankruptcy. 
  
Applicant purchased a condominium in 2005 or 2006.2
 
 (Tr. 32; GE 1 at 11) The 
two mortgages on his condominium totaled about $155,000. (Tr. 40) He had good credit 
until 2007. (Tr. 18) His mortgage payments were about $1,200 per month, and he had 
difficulty making his monthly mortgage payments. He borrowed from his 401K account 
and used his credit cards to make payments on his mortgages. (Tr. 35, 44) He tried to 
sell his furniture and obtain a roommate to raise funds. (Tr. 37-38, 47) He stopped 
making payments on his two mortgages in September or October of 2007. (Tr. 32) He 
moved out of his condominium around December 2007. (GE 1 at 11)  
Applicant went on a European vacation in September or October 2007 to Italy 
and Germany. (Tr. 34, 46; GE 2 at 11) He acknowledged the European trip was 
irresponsible; however, he wanted to take the trip to reduce stress from his bills and his 
mother’s illness. (Tr. 47) He paid for the European trip using the credit card, which is 
listed in SOR ¶ 1.d ($4,316). (Tr. 34) He went on a vacation-cruise to Mexico in 
December 2008. (Tr. 35-37) He stopped making payments on his credit cards before he 
was laid off from his employment in September 2009. (Tr. 30, 33) He started his current 
employment in November or December 2009. (Tr. 38) In December 2009, he told an 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he was going to start making 
payments to his creditors. (Tr. 39) He said he provided financial support to his mother, 
who suffered from multiple sclerosis; however, he was unable to provide details about 
the amount of financial support he provided to her. (Tr. 39-40) 
 
Applicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS) in November 2010, 
and the financial entries remain about the same as of his hearing on September 27, 
2011. (Tr. 22-23) His monthly financial entries are: gross income of $3,840; net income 
of $2,472; expenses of $2,025; debt payments of $175; and net remainder of about 
$272. (Tr. 22-30; GE 2 at 25) His PFS indicates he was paying $50 monthly to address 
a delinquent state tax debt of $400 from 2008. (Tr. 28-29) He has not made any 
                                            
2 Throughout Appellant’s hearing statement, he had difficulty providing dates for important 
financial events such as purchases and employment. For example, he was unable to state the year he 
moved out of his condominium. (Tr. 37) He was unsure about numerous financial details. (Tr. 37-41)

payments on his 2008 state tax debt for about nine months because of financial 
hardship. (Tr. 29) He does not have any savings, and he has about $200 in his checking 
account. (Tr. 26, 29, 45) He has about $5,000 in his 401K account. (Tr. 46) His only 
monthly payment is his vehicle loan, and that monthly payment is $360. (Tr. 24) His 
bankruptcy lawyer told Applicant to stop making payments on his credit cards. (Tr. 26)    
 
 In about December 2004, Applicant used his severance pay from one job to pay 
off his student loan of about $5,000. (Tr. 43; GE 1 at 22) He was unable to describe the 
total amount of debt that would be discharged through his bankruptcy. (Tr. 49-50) He 
had financial counseling, which was required for him to file for bankruptcy. (Tr. 50) He 
disclosed his financial problems on his October 4, 2009 security clearance application. 
(GE 1 at 41-47) 
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, 
emphasizing that, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy 
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon meeting the criteria 
contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Adverse clearance decisions are made “in terms of the national interest and 
shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [a]pplicant concerned.” See 
Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, 
nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, 
in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations) with respect to the allegations 
set forth in the SOR. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
security clearance application, credit reports, responses to DOHA interrogatories, and 
SOR response. Applicant’s SOR lists nine delinquent debts totaling $30,816. Several 
debts became delinquent in September or October  2007 and have not been resolved in 
four years. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions 
because he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent 
debts. His delinquent debts are “a continuing course of conduct” under the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive 
credit under AG ¶ 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems 
“occurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.” There is some 
residual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to avoidance of future 
delinquent debts.  
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. Applicant’s financial situation was damaged by 
unemployment and his efforts to support his mother, who has multiple sclerosis. 
However, there is insufficient evidence about these circumstances to show he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. He did not provide sufficient information about his 
variations in income or the amount of money he provided to his mother to establish full 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b). He told the OPM investigator in December 2009 that he 
was going to pay the debts discussed in the interview, and the only debt that was paid 
was paid through the IRS diversion of his tax refund for tax year 2010. Once Applicant 
learned of his delinquent debts, he had an obligation to maintain contact with his 
creditors3
 
 and resolve his debts. There is insufficient evidence to establish his diligence 
in meeting these security responsibilities.    
Applicant disclosed that he defaulted on two mortgages, totaling about $155,000, 
and the SOR only lists one SOR-related delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($14,000). He has 
a delinquent state tax debt for about $400. There may be other delinquent debts listed 
on his bankruptcy schedules. Because these financial problems were not listed on his 
SOR, he has not had adequate notice, and I am not drawing any adverse inference 
against him concerning these financial problems.4
 
    
AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. He received financial counseling and 
showed some good faith5
                                            
3“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 in connection with his bankruptcy. His bankruptcy will resolve 
 
4In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). I have not considered these non-SOR issues and problems for any adverse purpose.  
 
5The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
all of his delinquent non-priority debts. Applicant understands what he must do to 
establish his financial responsibility. However, Applicant cannot receive full credit under 
AG ¶ 20(c) because there is insufficient corroborating documentary evidence that his 
financial problem is being resolved and his finances are under control. His history of 
delinquent debt extends back to 2007. There is an insufficient track record of debt 
payment to provide assurance that he will show future financial responsibility. AG ¶ 
20(e) is not applicable because Applicant did not provide documentation showing he 
disputed any of his SOR debts.   
 
In sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts 
sooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He has had steady employment from 
December 2009. He did not provide enough information about how his unemployment 
affected his finances. Several of his delinquent debts were incurred about four years 
ago and most of the time from 2007 to present he was employed. There are no receipts 
or account statements from creditors, establishing any payments to his SOR creditors. 
His documented steps are simply inadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations 
security concerns. Applicant did not establish that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances.    
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
                                                                                                                                            
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

Some whole-person factors support Applicant’s access to classified information; 
however, they are not sufficient to fully mitigate security concerns. Applicant admitted 
responsibility for eight of nine SOR debts totaling about $30,000. His unemployment 
and his mother’s illness adversely affected his finances. He admitted his financial 
predicament in his security clearance application, to an OPM investigator, in his 
response to DOHA interrogatories, and at his hearing. His testimony was credible, and 
he is an honest, forthright person. One SOR debt was paid when the IRS diverted his 
2010 federal income tax refund. His effort to resolve his delinquent debts through 
bankruptcy is a positive step in the resolution of his financial problems.  
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or 
responsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He fell behind on his debts in 
September or October 2007, and he has been unable to make sufficient progress on his 
debts to establish he is serious about paying his creditors. He took at least two 
vacations outside the United States, using funds that could have been applied to his 
debts. He did not provide sufficient information about the adverse effects of his 
unemployment and his mother’s illness on his financial situation to meet his burden of 
showing his actions were reasonable under the circumstances. His documented actions 
were insufficient to establish he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He had 
sufficient opportunity to make greater progress in the resolution of his SOR debts, or to 
provide adequate documentation to mitigate financial issues.  
 
A post-bankruptcy period showing financial responsibility is necessary. 
Applicant’s promise to maintain financial responsibility after his bankruptcy is insufficient 
without a documented track record of financial responsibility.6
   
 Lingering doubts remain 
concerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has not fully 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
