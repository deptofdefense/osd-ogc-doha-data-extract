HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists eight delinquent debts totaling $269,051. He made 
insufficient progress resolving these debts. He failed to disclose his delinquent debts 
and the suspension of his security clearance on his 2009 security clearance application. 
He committed offenses that resulted in preferral of charges and his resignation in lieu of 
trial by court-martial. He received an Other Than Honorable characterization of his 
service on his most recent DD Form 214. Eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 16, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
August 4, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to 
Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On August 31, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On November 3, 
2010, DOHA amended the SOR. On November 12, 2010, Department Counsel 
indicated she was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. On November 16, 2010, 
DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On November 30, 2010, DOHA issued a 
hearing notice. (HE 1) On December 1, 2010, Applicant responded to the Amended 
SOR. (HE 4) On December 15, 2010, Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered 6 exhibits (GE 1-6) (Tr. 29-30), and Applicant offered 26 
exhibits, which were pre-marked. (Tr. 17, 31-32; AE A, A1-A25) There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-6, AE A, and AE A1-A25. (Tr. 30, 32) Additionally, I 
admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR and Amended 
SOR response, which included the Amended SOR, as hearing exhibits. (HE 1-4) On 
January 3, 2011, I received the transcript. I held the record open until May 18, 2011. On 
May 17, 2011, I received 15 additional exhibits. (AE B-1 to B-15) There were no 
objections to Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits, and I admitted them into evidence. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted responsibility for SOR debts ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. 
and to the allegations in Amended SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.d, and 2.e. (HE 3, 4)2 He denied the 
other SOR allegations; however, he did make some limited admissions to several SOR 
allegations, which will be addressed below. He also provided some extenuating and 
mitigating information. (HE 3, 4) His admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is 49 years old, and he has been employed by a government contractor 
for 17 months. (Tr. 5, 42) As a contractor employee, he trains military personnel on 
operations and information flow at various command and staff levels. (Tr. 42-43) He 
was born in the Dominican Republic and is one of 13 children. (Tr. 20) Several of his 
siblings or siblings-in-law are married to field grade officers in the U.S. military or to law 
enforcement officials. (Tr. 20) Applicant’s father is a retired E-7. (Tr. 20) Applicant has 
been married for 23 years, and his children are ages 13, 18, and 21. (Tr. 41) 
 
 
 
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. With the consent of all parties, Applicant’s opening statement 
was considered as substantive evidence. (Tr. 29) 
 
2 I amended SOR ¶ 2(c) to conform with Applicant’s response to the Amended SOR by changing 
the word “conducted” to “convened” because Applicant resigned from the Army before his Article 32 
investigation was conducted, but after it was convened. (Tr. 13)

Applicant earned a high school diploma in 1980. (Tr. 5) He graduated from a 
Latin American Army Command and Staff College in 1993 and from the U.S. Army’s 
Command and General Staff College in 1999. (Tr. 6) He was awarded a Masters 
Degree in Latin American Studies in 2001 and a Masters Degree in Business 
Administration in International Business in 2003. (Tr. 5-6)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists eight allegedly delinquent debts totaling $269,051. The 
status of those eight SOR debts is as follows: 
  
SOR ¶ 1.a mortgage debt ($253,431)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant purchased a 
residential property in the mid-1990s, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) 
guaranteed $36,000 of the loan. (Tr. 51-52, 56, 65; GE 2 at 8) Applicant was unsure 
when he made the most recent payment on the mortgage. (Tr. 61) In 2003, Applicant 
asked the creditor for the status on his mortgage account. (Tr. 59) He learned that as of 
March 19, 2003, he owed $209,745 to the creditor, which included $46,404 in unpaid 
principal and $32,249 in “Mortgage Insurance Premium.” (Tr. 54, 59; GE 2 at 11)3 He 
learned the property was going into foreclosure “because there were so many, so many 
late payments, that [he] hadn’t had the ability to pay on that, so basically [his] thought 
process was to go into foreclosure.” (Tr. 59-60) He emphasized his knowledge that “the 
VA guaranteed that [he] wouldn’t lose [his VA loan eligibility] because of that, because 
that’s one of the reasons why they lend to veterans because it’s guaranteed.” (Tr. 59-
60) In July 2005, the mortgage creditor filed a judgment against Applicant for $253,431. 
(SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. 56-57; GE 2 at 23) Applicant said he was overseas or in a different state 
from the property when the judgment was filed, and he was not aware of it. (Tr. 55, 57) 
Applicant thought the VA took over the ownership of the property. (Tr. 64) Applicant said 
that in 2008, the property was auctioned for $119,000. (Tr. 53, 55) Applicant said that 
the VA paid the deficiency. (Tr. 53; SOR response) He did not provide any 
documentation about the auction or to support his belief that the VA paid the deficiency. 
Applicant said he received a tax document relating to the sale; however, he could not 
find it. (Tr. 55) On August 28, 2009, the VA wrote Applicant that the VA paid $36,000 
towards Applicant’s delinquency, and his entitlement could not “be restored until VA’s 
loss on the loan has been fully repaid.” (GE 2 at 8; GE 3 at 5) After Applicant received 
the SOR, he checked with the court, and there was a judgment filed against him. (Tr. 
67) In August 2010, Applicant asked the creditor on the judgment about the debt and 
learned it had been transferred; however, Applicant did not indicate which bank held the 
debt nor did he describe any efforts to resolve the debt with the new creditor. (Tr. 67-68) 
He did not provide a release or satisfaction of the judgment or any documentation from 
 
3On October 12, 2009, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed 
Applicant concerning this debt. (AE A22 at 3) The OPM summary reads, “Until the lawsuit was filed during 
July 2005, the subject was unaware there was a problem with the mortgage, or that the renters had 
vacated the residence several months before. (AE A22 at 3) He also told the OPM investigator that he 
believed the Veterans Administration paid off the mortgage and the judgment was satisfied. Id. The SOR 
did not allege that Applicant lied to the OPM investigator about when he learned his mortgage was 
delinquent, and that he believed that the VA satisfied the judgment.

the VA indicating the VA was not interested in recouping the VA’s $36,000 loss of funds. 
See n. 16 infra.   
 
SOR ¶ 1.b telecommunications debt ($522)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant said 
the debt was transferred. He said he paid it, and he promised to try to find the letter 
from the creditor so that he could provide it to DOHA. (Tr. 69-71; SOR response) 
However, he did not provide any documentary evidence the debt was paid or otherwise 
resolved.   
 
SOR ¶ 1.c student loan debt ($2,095)—FORBEARANCE. Applicant provided a 
letter indicating his student loan was in forbearance and not delinquent. (Tr. 75; SOR 
response) An August 30, 2010 letter from the creditor indicated the forbearance would 
expire nine days before Applicant’s hearing, and a $723 payment would be due on 
December 4, 2010. (Tr. 76) Applicant did not make any payment to the creditor; 
however, he believed he would send $400 after discussing a payment plan with the 
creditor. (Tr. 77-78) He also thought the creditor should send him another bill before he 
makes a payment. (Tr. 78) He was also too distracted about other matters to take care 
of this debt in December 2010. (Tr. 79) After his hearing, he provided a letter indicating 
his student loans, totaling more than $80,000, were in forbearance until May 31, 2016. 
(AE B11) He did not provide documentation explaining how he convinced the creditor to 
approve the forbearance.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e credit union debts ($5,223 and $3,140)—PAYMENT 
PLAN. On October 12, 2009, an OPM investigator interviewed Applicant concerning 
these two debts. (AE A22 at 3-4) For SOR debt 1.d, Applicant explained that he 
purchased a motorcycle, which was voluntarily repossessed. For SOR debt 1.e, he had 
a line of credit. He fell behind on his payments for both debts after he was discharged 
from the Army. He said he would arrange a payment plan for both debts within 45 days. 
Applicant said he made four $200 payments from September to December 2010, and 
he said he will begin making $400 monthly payments in January 2011. (Tr. 80-81; SOR 
response) On August 24, 2010, the creditor wrote that this payment plan is satisfactory 
to the creditor. (Tr. 80; SOR response enclosure 4)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f bank debt ($3,473)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant said he gave a car to 
his brother, and his brother was supposed to repay the loan on the car. His brother 
made one $1,000 payment to the creditor, and his brother promised to pay the 
remainder of the debt. (Tr. 82) He did not provide proof of any payments to the creditor.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.g credit card debt ($945)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant said he paid the 
debt before January 2010. (Tr. 83-84; SOR response) He expected the creditor would 
provide verification of payment to the credit bureaus. (SOR response) He did not 
provide proof of payment. (Tr. 84-85)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.h insurance debt ($222)—PAID. In response to interrogatories, 
Applicant provided to DOHA a photocopy of the front of a check, dated January 26, 
2010, written to the creditor to show payment (GE 2 at 12); however, at his hearing he 
disclosed that after he wrote the check, he stopped payment because the insurance 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
company told him he did not owe anything. (Tr. 85-86) His response to interrogatories 
indicated, “I feel it is best to pay the said amount and close out this debt in order that it 
will not [] effect my being granted a security clearance.” (GE 2 at 4) However, the 
delinquent debt was still on his credit report. (Tr. 86-87) He provided an insurance card 
effective January 29, 2010, and said the insurance company would not have provided 
the card if he owed a delinquent debt to the insurance company. (Tr. 87) He is no longer 
with the insurance company that sent the derogatory information to the credit reporting 
company. (Tr. 87; SOR response at enclosure 2) He is credited with resolving the debt 
because receipt of the insurance card is persuasive evidence that the debt was paid.  
 
On October 12, 2009, an OPM investigator discussed a delinquent credit card 
debt owed to a nonappropriated fund activity, and the total amount owed was $5,200.4 
(AE A22 at 4) Applicant promised to work out a payment plan in the next 45 days. Id. 
On February 25, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) notified Applicant that his 
entire tax refund of $7,209 had been intercepted to pay two debts owed to the 
nonappropriated fund activity who issued the credit card discussed previously in this 
paragraph. (AE B10)  
 
On October 12, 2009, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he planned to 
work out payment plans with all of his creditors and then use a debt consolidation 
service to pay the creditors. (GE 2 at 25; AE A22 at 5) No effectuated debt consolidation 
plans are included in the record. 
 
After his hearing, Applicant provided a budget. (Tr. 95; AE B14) His budget 
showed monthly income of $8,562; monthly expenses of $7,220; and $1,342 for savings 
and discretionary spending. (AE B14) He did not indicate any payments for his SOR 
creditors. (AE B14) He said he could also provide medical records about his depression 
(Tr. 109); however, he failed to do so. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
On September 23, 2005, Applicant’s access to classified information was 
suspended because he was under investigation for altering his officer evaluation report 
(OER). (AE A13 at ¶ 1) The document suspending his clearance stated that there were 
“indications of fraudulent travel vouchers, government travel card fraud, and other 
trustworthiness issues” as the basis for the suspension.5  
 
On or about April 2006, Applicant was charged with two specifications of being 
absent without leave (AWOL), in violation of Article 86, Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(UCMJ); one specification of failing to obey an order or regulation, in violation of Article 
92, UCMJ; five specifications of making a false official statement, in violation of Article 
 
4 This debt is not listed on the SOR. 
 
5 AE A13 at ¶ 2. On July 27, 2006, Applicant’s security manager recommended revocation of his 
security clearance. (AE A13 at ¶ 3) 
 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
107, UCMJ; four specifications of larceny, in violation of Article 121, UCMJ; 11 
specifications of fraud, in violation of Article 132, UCMJ; and one specification of 
conduct unbecoming an officer, in violation of Article 133, UCMJ. (SOR ¶ 2.c) His 
charges were referred to an Article 32, UCMJ, investigation on or about April 12, 2006. 
(SOR ¶ 2.c)  
 
Applicant briefly discussed the basis of his charges, and his decision to resign in 
lieu of trial by court-martial. He said his lawyer provided “inadequate advice.” (AE A) He 
said the basis of the 20 specifications was “one isolated incident in over 20 yrs of 
‘Honorable’ service.” (AE A at 1) He previously received multiple DD Form 214s 
describing his service as honorable from the Army. (AE A at 1) He attributed his 
problems during his most recent Army assignment to his exit brief from an overseas 
assignment, which “cost a lot of people’s career and caused a lot of changes” where he 
was assigned. (Tr. 21-22) He conceded that when he was assigned overseas, he 
signed a form, that he was not permitted to sign, that could be used to receive 
government funds. (Tr. 107) He acknowledged he was culpable for this conduct. (Tr. 
107-08)    
 
On June 1, 2006, the charges against Applicant were dismissed because the 
Army accepted his resignation. (Tr. 32; AE A1; HE 4 at 1) On June 16, 2006, Applicant 
was formally notified that his resignation from the Army was approved, and that his 
characterization of service was under Other Than Honorable conditions.6 (SOR ¶ 2.d; 
GE 3 at 80-82) Applicant admitted this SOR allegation. (HE 4)  
 
In December 2010, the Army recalculated Applicant’s credits for reserve duty and 
provided him a “20-Year Letter.” His status was changed to retired from the Army, and 
he will receive retirement pay at age 60, subject to an offset for Special Separation 
Benefit (SSB) pay received. (Tr. 19, 32; AE A2)7  
 
Applicant did not provide copies of his charge sheet or any documentation about 
the investigations.8 Applicant claimed that his lawyer told Applicant that he had a 90 
percent chance of winning his case; however, it might take a year or two to complete 
the investigation. (Tr. 24; AE A15 at Block 15) His lawyer was located a substantial 
distance from Applicant’s location. (Tr. 26; AE A15 at Block 15) He decided to resign 
 
6 Two weeks before his hearing, he requested that the Army upgrade his discharge from other 
than honorable to honorable. (Tr. 113; AE A15)   
 
7 His 1993 DD Form 214 shows an SSB Payment of $52,000. (AE A6) 
 
8 Applicant was investigated three times for fraud. (Tr. 23) The third time he was suspended from 
military duties for eight months. (Tr. 24) Department Counsel checked with the major command legal 
office that processed Applicant’s resignation, and that office was unable to locate a copy of Applicant’s 
file. (Tr. 38, 71-74, March 21, 2011 Memorandum from Department Counsel) Records may be available at 
the Army Office of the Judge Advocate General (OTJAG), which processed his resignation to the 
Assistant Secretary of the Army, the 4-star level headquarters or personnel office that endorsed 
Applicant’s resignation to OTJAG, the command level that preferred charges against Applicant, or from 
the restricted fiche of Applicant’s Official Military Personnel File. My file does not contain a charge sheet 
or any investigative records relating to Applicant’s charges.

because he “didn’t want to waste the Government’s money,” he did not want to destroy 
or derail other military officer’s careers, and he “was suffering from depression.” (Tr. 25-
26; AE A) He said that the VA subsequently determined he was suffering from 
“precombat stress,” and he had 16 people living in his house as a result of Hurricane 
Katrina. (Tr. 25) Resignation was the best choice for Applicant and the Army. (Tr. 26)  
  
 On September 16, 2009, Applicant completed his 54-page SF 86. (GE 1) He 
disclosed that he was charged under Article 132, UCMJ and he submitted a resignation 
“for the good of the service in lieu of general court-martial.” (GE 1) He said the 
circumstances were “under other than honorable.” (GE 1 at 26) He described the 
charges as a “misunderstanding” relating to a personality conflict with his rater over 
mission objectives. (GE 1 at 26) He did not list any other charges preferred against him, 
even though the maximum punishment for some of them carry more than a one-year 
maximum confinement. See e.g., Article 107, UCMJ (5 year maximum punishment). In 
Section 22c, he answered “No” to the question, “Have you ever been charged with any 
felony offense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.)”9  
 
 Applicant’s responses to some questions on his SF 86 are detailed. (GE 1) For 
example, in Section 13 Employment Activities, he listed six employers over the last 
seven years, and for Section 18 Relatives, he listed 14 relatives. (GE 1) 
     
 Section 25b of his SF 86 asks, “Investigations and Clearance Record. b. To your 
knowledge, have you EVER had a clearance or access authorization denied, 
suspended, or revoked; or been debarred from government employment?” Applicant 
answered, “No” to this question. On September 23, 2005, Applicant was debriefed and 
his access was suspended pending completion of an Army Regulation (AR) 15-6 
investigation. (SOR ¶ 2.e; GE 3 at 79) Applicant admitted the SOR allegation. (HE 4) 
 
 Section 26 of his September 16, 2009 SF 86 asks a series of questions about 
Applicant’s financial responsibility. Section 26b asks, “In the last 7 years, have you had 
any possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or foreclosed?”10 
Section 26m asks, “In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)?” and section 26n asks, “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)?” 11 Applicant answered, “No” to all three questions. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b) 
 
 
9 The SOR did not allege that he provided false or misleading information about his charges on 
his 2009 SF 86. 
 
10 SOR ¶ 2a indicates the pertinent question is in his 2009 SF 86 § 26d, which asks “In the last 7 
years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?” The drafter of the SOR 
apparently relied upon a previous version of the SF 86. The information sought is similar and this 
discrepancy is not material in this case. 
  
11 SOR ¶ 2b incorrectly indicates the pertinent questions on his 2009 SF 86 are in §§ 26a and 
26b, which ask the same questions as in his 2009 SF 86, which are in §§ 26m and 26n. This discrepancy 
is not material.

Applicant said that when he completed his SF 86, he did not disclose the 
repossession of this property because he “did not read the question” that sought this 
information. (Tr. 63, 88) Alternatively, he believed that because the property went to 
auction, “so for all intents and purposes, in my thought process, it was cleared up. I had 
no issues.” (Tr. 63) He “had no knowledge of the negative information that was posted 
in [his] credit report.” (SOR response) He noted that he wished he had run a credit 
report before completing his SF 86, and he would have answered differently. (Tr. 88)   
 
When he signed the undated document entitled “SECURITY TERMINATION 
STATEMENT” concerning revocation of his security clearance, he claimed that he 
thought he was signing a document concerning loss of access to a location because of 
being relocated. (Tr. 26; AE A at 2; AE A18; GE 3 at 85) He never received the July 27, 
2006 letter stating that his security clearance was revoked. (Tr. 26-27; AE A at 2; A13)12         
 
Medals and Awards Listed on Applicant’s Resume 
 
Applicant’s August 1, 1993 and October 1, 2005 DD Form 214s list a Pathfinder 
Badge, Senior Parachutist Badge, Army Commendation Medal, National Defense 
Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, Ranger Tab, and Air 
Assault Badge. (AE A5, AE A6) A DD Form 214 is an important official document, and it 
is a fairly reliable description of military service, as military personnel offices are not 
supposed to place information on this document without appropriate substantiating 
documentation.   
 
Applicant’s Officer Evaluation Reports (OERs) describe his outstanding duty 
performance, integrity, reliability, and responsibility. (AE A7) There is an unexplained 
gap in his OERs from May 20, 1998 until October 1, 2003. (AE A7) He was promoted to 
lieutenant colonel in June 2003, and he is credited in the whole-person concept, infra at 
page 16, with having outstanding OERs. His OERs for October 1, 2003 to September 
30, 2004 and October 1, 2004 to February 18, 2005 describe outstanding service in 
South America, not Southwest Asia. (AE A7)  
 
Applicant’s DD Form 214 does not include a Bronze Star or show any service in 
combat zones; however, Applicant was not available to sign the DD Form 214 and the 
comment section, Block 18, indicates that a “DD Form 215 will be issued to provide 
missing information.” (Tr. 34; AE A at 2; AE A14)  
 
Applicant said he deployed to Southwest Asia (SWA). (Tr. 115) He submitted a 
resume showing award of a Combat Infantry Badge (CIB), Expert Infantry Badge (EIB), 
Bronze Star Medal (BSM), Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia), Southwest Asia 
Service Medal, and Meritorious Service Medal (MSM). (Tr. 116-117; AE A8, AE A9 at 
13 (except for the CIB)) His resume’s chronological record of duty assignments does 
not show any assignments in SWA. (AE A8 at 3) However, he said he was assigned to 
 
12 The July 27, 2006 memorandum from Applicant’s security manager is addressed to the U.S. 
Army Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility, and there is no indication on the memorandum that it 
was provided to Applicant.

Fort Bragg from May 1989 to July 1990, and I take judicial notice of the fact that his 
division was frequently deployed and was deployed to SWA in 1990 for Desert 
Shield/Desert Storm. (AE A8 at 3; AE A9 at 11-12)  
 
Applicant agreed to provide the award certificates and OERs to support the 
awards. (Tr. 116, 118) He said he had all of his OERs. (Tr. 119) His OERs would likely 
show whether he was assigned to SWA and Kuwait at the requisite time to receive the 
two ribbons. I told him this documentation was important because his DD Form 214s did 
not show any of these medals. (Tr. 116) He said when some of his DD Form 214s were 
prepared he was not paying attention to his records. (Tr. 117)  
 
After Applicant’s hearing, he provided his Officer Record Brief (ORB). (AE B1) It 
lists a Bronze Star Medal and MSM, EIB; however, it does not list a Kuwait Liberation 
Medal or CIB. (AE B1) It lists a six-month assignment to Central Command in 2002, 
which has jurisdiction over SWA and for five months to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in 
2005. Although an ORB is not the most reliable personnel document concerning awards 
and assignments, I draw no adverse negative inference from his failure to provide the 
promised award certificates and OERs, and credit Applicant, for purposes of his security 
clearance, with meritorious, honorable service in a combat zone.   
 
Other Character Evidence 
 
Applicant provided statements from multiple character witnesses, which lauded 
his diligence, dedication, trustworthiness, professionalism, enthusiasm, organizational 
skills, computer literacy, expertise, commitment, and contributions to mission 
accomplishment. (SOR response, AE A23, AE B15) His character witnesses have 
knowledge of Applicant primarily through the work environment. However, they did not 
include in their basis of knowledge a description of the basis of his Other Than 
Honorable discharge from the Army or of the charges preferred against him. They did 
not discuss his history of financial problems.   
 
Applicant provided good service to the Army up until the time he committed the 
conduct resulting in his charges and specifications and to his employer after leaving the 
Army, as demonstrated by his awards, promotions, positive evaluations, and pay raises. 
(Tr. 19; AE B6; B7; B8; B9) He has held a security clearance for 20 years without any 
evidence of security violations. (Tr. 20)  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his OPM personal subject interview (PSI), and his statement at his 
hearing. Applicant’s SOR lists eight debts totaling $269,051. Some of his debts have 
been delinquent for more than five years. His largest debt of more than $200,000 has 
not been resolved. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants partial application of AG ¶¶ 
20(b), 20(c), and 20(d).13 Although Applicant did not receive financial counseling, he 
generated a budget, and he has extensive knowledge of finances. He understands what 
he must do to maintain a budget and pay his debts. He showed some good faith when 
he admitted responsibility for his SOR debts. Applicant’s financial situation was 
damaged by insufficient income, and a period of unemployment after he left active Army 
service in 2006. However, his financial circumstances have been stable since at least 
October 2009 because he was employed without any periods of unemployment.  
 
Applicant did not establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
He did not take reasonable actions to investigate and document resolution of the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g. I have credited Applicant with mitigation of the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c (forbearance), 1.d (payment plan), 1.e (payment plan), and 1.h (paid). He 
did not prove he maintained contact with all of his creditors.14 Prior to his hearing, his 
 
13The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
14“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
 
13 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                            
payments to his creditors were very limited. Most of his delinquent SOR debt is not 
being resolved and is not under control because over the last 12 months his SOR debts 
are increasing faster than they are being paid.  
 
Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence showing disputes of any 
SOR debts. In sum, Applicant’s efforts are insufficient to fully mitigate financial 
considerations security concerns.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative.15 
 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
15The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9,

 (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; and 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable 
behavior . . . ; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. 
Applicant admitted that on his September 16, 2009 SF 86, he failed to disclose 
debts that were currently delinquent more than 90 days, and debts that were delinquent 
more than 180 days in the last seven years. He also failed to disclose the suspension or 
revocation of his security clearance. I do not believe his hearing statement that he did 
not read or notice these three questions. He has detailed responses to several 
questions on his 2009 SF 86, and he is an intelligent and well-educated person who has 
earned two masters degrees. He has held a security clearance for 20 years and knows 
the importance of carefully completing documents, such as his SF 86. I find he 
intentionally and deliberately failed to disclose the information requested on these three 
questions on his 2009 SF 86. 
 
It is unproven that Applicant was aware of the judgment entered against him until 
after he completed his 2009 SF 86. The conduct that resulted in the charges and 
ultimately his resignation from the Army has not been rebutted or refuted. However, 
SOR ¶¶ 2.c and 2.d related to administrative results of his charged conduct. Those two 
allegations are merged into SOR ¶ 2.c, and SOR ¶ 2.d is found for Applicant.   
 
AG ¶ 17 includes seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
including: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or 
significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or 
 
education and other experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to 
disclose past-due debts on a security clearance application was deliberate).  
 
 
15 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning the security 
clearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide 
the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so 
infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to 
change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, 
circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate 
behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to 
exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs 
under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and regulations. 
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply because Applicant intentionally and 
deliberately provided false information in his responses to three questions on his 
September 16, 2009 SF about his delinquent debts and security clearance history. I do 
not believe his statement at the hearing about not reading the questions. Additionally, 
his charged conduct is serious and still relatively recent. His charges were not 
sufficiently addressed for Applicant to meet his burden of showing they are mitigated. 
   
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance, there are several factors tending to support approval of his 
access to classified information. Applicant is 49 years old. He is sufficiently mature to 
understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit 
for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor and 
during his 23 years of Army service. He earned several military awards, successfully 
completed some military courses, rose to the grade of lieutenant colonel, and received 
some outstanding OERs and evaluations. He provided some laudatory character 
references. He is credited with serving honorably in a combat zone and earning a 
Bronze Star, MSM and various awards. He earned a bachelor’s degree and two 
master’s degrees. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his 
employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His 
unemployment after leaving active service contributed to his financial woes. Several 
character witnesses provided statements lauding his diligence, professionalism, and 
responsibility. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. Applicant’s SOR lists eight debts totaling $269,051. He did 
not take reasonable actions to investigate and document resolution of the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a ($253,431), 1.b ($522), 1.f ($3,473), and 1.g ($945). There was some evidence 
of non-SOR allegations: (1) he has a $36,000 delinquent debt to the VA for failing to 
repay his VA loan guarantee on his foreclosed residence; (2) his debt to a 
nonappropriated fund activity was paid by the IRS seizing his federal income tax refund 
in 2011; (3) he lied to the OPM investigator about when he learned of the problems 
relating to his mortgage and its current status; (4) he presented a resume showing 
various military awards he may not have earned; and (5) he suffers from depression. I 
decline to consider any of these allegations as adverse information, weighing against 
approval of his security clearance.16 I base the denial of his clearance solely on the 
SOR allegations that I find against him as indicated below.    
 
16 See supra n. 3, 4, and 9. In addition, the SOR did not allege the conduct alleged in these three 
footnotes. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). I decline to consider the non-SOR misconduct for any purpose because Applicant did not 
have a sufficient opportunity to fully address these allegations at his hearing.

I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
and personal conduct concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e: For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.b and 2.c:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.d:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.e:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
