GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding criminal conduct, 
personal conduct, and drug involvement. Eligibility for a security clearance and access 
to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 15, 2004, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on August 7, 2009.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him 
another set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on October 12, 
2009.3 On May 7, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant 
1 Government Exhibit 2 (SF 86), dated March 15, 2004.

to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) 
applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive, 
effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline J 
(Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline H Drug 
Involvement), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 11, 2010. In a sworn 
statement, dated June 26, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on August 3, 2010, and the case was assigned to 
Administrative Judge Sharon A. Dam on August 10, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on September 7, 2010, but the matter was continued upon Applicant’s request. 
The case was reassigned to me on October 4, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
November 13, 2010, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on November 30, 2010.  
 
During the hearing, 7 Government exhibits (GE 1-7) and 16 Applicant exhibits 
(AE A-P) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and two witnesses 
testified on his behalf. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 7, 2010.  
  
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations 
pertaining to criminal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.), and two of the factual allegations 
pertaining to personal conduct (¶¶ 2.a. and 2.b.), of the SOR. Those admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.c. and 3.a.). During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by 
adding two additional factual allegations pertaining to criminal conduct. In the absence 
of any objection, the motion was granted and ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e. were added to the SOR.4 
Applicant admitted both of the allegations.5 After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a senior electrical engineer and hull manager.6 He is seeking to retain the secret

clearance he was previously granted in October 2000.7 Applicant has held a secret 
clearance since 1994.8 He is a 1994 high school graduate, with a 2000 bachelor of 
science in electrical engineering, and a 2010 master’s degree in business 
administration.9 While in high school, Applicant held a number of different part-time 
jobs. His last position was as a laboratory technician at the local power plant.10  
 
Upon his high school graduation in June 1994, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. 
Marine Corps (USMC) Reserve.11 He remained on active duty until August 1995, when 
he reverted to a reserve status while in school. Applicant joined his current employer as 
an intern in March 2000,12 and upon his graduation in December 2000, was hired as a 
full-time engineer.13 In June 2004, Applicant was recalled to active duty to train Marines 
getting ready to deploy to Iraq and Afghanistan.14 He was appointed a warrant officer in 
December 2004.15 In March 2005, he was deployed to Iraq where he served as an 
avionics officer aboard helicopters.16 He returned to the United States in October 2005, 
but remained on active duty until February 2006 when he rejoined his current 
employer.17 Applicant was recalled to active duty in February 2007, and was promoted 
to squadron maintenance and material control officer.18 He was released from active 
duty in September 2008 when he rejoined his current employer.19 In June 2009, 
Applicant resigned his warrant (he was a Chief Warrant Officer-2) and was 
administratively discharged under other than honorable conditions for drug involvement, 
based solely upon his conviction.20  
 
Applicant was married in 2001 and divorced in 2005.21 He is engaged to be 
married in September 2011.22 He has one daughter, born in 1997, from a prior 
relationship.23 He has always been his daughter’s custodial parent.24

Criminal Conduct and Drug Involvement 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.c.): In August 1996, when he was 20 years old, Applicant was working 
“graveyard shift” as a package handler for a delivery company while attending school. A 
box of T-shirts addressed to a sporting goods store was damaged, and Applicant took a 
T-shirt from a pile outside the box and intended to take it without permission.25 At the 
end of his shift, Applicant placed the shirt in his truck and departed.26 Applicant was 
questioned by a police officer who was called to the scene by Applicant’s employer.27 
According to the officer, Applicant said he would return the shirt, but by January 1997, 
he had not done so.28 A criminal complaint for petty theft was filed and a letter was 
mailed to Applicant at his last known local address, notifying him of the charges filed 
against him and the arraignment date which was scheduled for December 5, 1996.29 
The letter was returned with a notation that the address given “does not exist.”30 
Applicant contended he had resided in ten different addresses during college, and had 
never received the complaint or the letter.31 An arrest warrant was issued on January 
16, 1997. On January 21, 2002, it was purged, and the charge was dismissed in 
furtherance of justice for lack of prosecution.32 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.b.): An investigation regarding alleged fraudulent travel claims 
submitted by five USMC Reservists, including Applicant, was conducted because of 
suspicions that the Marines actually resided within the 50-mile travel radius to the 
military facility and therefore were not entitled to a maximum lodging rate.33 Preliminary 
inquiries determined Applicant’s permanent residence was in the local area.34 An Article 
32, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), Investigation was initiated due to

States), and Article 81, UCMJ (conspiracy).35 Applicant contends the allegations were 
false and baseless.36 All charges against Applicant and two other Marines were 
dismissed at the Article 32.37  
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.d.): In October 2006, Applicant was visiting his parents during 
Halloween weekend. He consumed a few beers with his father, ate dinner, and then met 
his brother and some friends at a local pub where they played pool and consumed more 
beer and hard liquor.38 Applicant was driving from the pub to his brother’s residence 
when he was pulled over by the police.39 Applicant registered 0.08 on a blood alcohol 
test that was administered.40 He was arrested and charged with driving while 
intoxicated (DWI).41 He was convicted of the charge,42 and sentenced to three years of 
probation, $2,500 fine, five days of community service, and one night in jail.43 Although 
Applicant attended Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings and alcohol education for three 
months, he did not have any individual therapy, and did not undergo any urinalysis.44 
He continued his heavy consumption 45
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): In November 2007, while visiting his parents during the 
Thanksgiving weekend, a similar scenario played out. This time, however, he was 
stopped while driving a woman home.46 Applicant registered 0.14 on a blood alcohol 
test that was administered.47 Applicant was arrested and charged with DWI.48 He was 
convicted of the charge,49 and sentenced to 50 days in jail, reduced to 50 days

is unclear if there was a fine administered. Applicant was required to attend AA weekly 
for 18 months, alcohol education, and group therapy.51 Three years later, as of the 
hearing, Applicant still attends monthly AA meetings.52 He recognizes that he is an 
alcoholic and aspires to become abstinent.53 He does not have a sponsor. Applicant 
can recite the Sere
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 3.a.): Applicant owns several investment properties. He would 
periodically go to one particular property to collect the rent, and on one particular 
occasion, while repairing the washer and dryer, he detected the strong aroma of 
marijuana.55 Thinking it was the result of his tenant merely smoking a “joint,” Applicant 
did not give the incident any further interest.56 Applicant suspected his tenant might be 
growing marijuana but did nothing because he did not wish to violate his tenant’s 
privacy.57 Furthermore, the tenant was a “paying renter,”58 and with the state of the real 
estate market, he chose to ignore the tenant’s actions.59 In October 2008, the police 
came to his place of employment and took Applicant into custody before driving to the 
rental property. A number of agents “swarmed” into the building and raided it.60 It 
appeared that Applicant’s tenant was cultivating marijuana in the building.61 In addition, 
it was discovered that the tenant had tapped into the electrical box of surrounding 
neighbors.62 Applicant is inconsistent in recalling his knowledge of the tenant’s actions 
pertaining to both the marijuana and the electrical box, claiming he was both unaware of 
the activity, and that he knew, but failed to report it.63

Applicant and his tenant were arrested and charged with: 1) possession of 
marijuana for sale, a felony; 2) cultivating marijuana, a felony; 3) tampering with electric, 
telephone, and cable television, a felony; and 4) injuring or interfering with electric lines, 
a felony.64 He remained in the county jail overnight to be processed. Although Applicant 
denied any culpability, as a single father he could not afford any jail time, so upon the 
advice of his attorney, Applicant agreed to a plea deal.65 He agreed to plead guilty to 
counts 1 and 2, with count 2 reduced to a misdemeanor and the remaining counts 
dismissed.66 He was sentenced to three years supervised probation, to expire on 
February 8, 2012; 45 days of public service; a restitution fine of $680, plus $200 to be 
suspended; and restitution of $10,000, at the rate of $50 per month. The restitution was 
to be a joint responsibility with Applicant’s co-defendant.67 
 
Although Applicant had experimented with marijuana while in college,68 he has 
never used it in the ensuing years.69 Nevertheless, in October 2008, Applicant sought 
medical treatment for a knee injury, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) from combat in Iraq.70 On October 21, 2008, the physician prescribed medical 
marijuana for the period of one year.71 Despite obtaining the prescription, Applicant 
never processed it and never used the marijuana.72 
 
In December 2008, Applicant started seeing a psychologist to “get back on the 
straight and narrow” because of three incidents since his return from Iraq.73 The 
psychologist’s preliminary DSM diagnostic impression was that Applicant had an 
adjustment disorder with disturbance of conduct, 309.3.74 After conducting 
psychological treatment on eight occasions, and being administered the Hamilton 
Anxiety Inventory75 and subliminal therapy – a relatively unknown therapeutic modality

that diagnosis is not supported by the more restrictive DSM.77  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
(SOR ¶ 2.a.): On February 26, 2009, Applicant was interviewed by an 
investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).78 During that interview, 
Applicant said he knew there was marijuana in the rental property because he had 
smelled it, but he was unaware that the tenant had been cultivating marijuana in the 
house. He also stated that he had failed to notice that the tenant had tapped into the 
electric box of surrounding neighbors.79 That information was not entirely accurate, for 
in his subsequent answers to interrogatories in August 2009, Applicant acknowledged 
knowing that the tenant was growing marijuana and that the electrical box had been 
tampered with, but he failed to report those facts because of the current real estate 
market situation.80 During the hearing, he reverted back to his original position about 
not actually knowing what his tenant had done.81 Applicant’s inconsistent explanations 
raise the specter that during his February 2009 interview, he may have deliberately 
failed to disclose what he knew and when he 
 
(SOR ¶ 2.b.): The SOR alleges that during the same OPM interview, Applicant 
deliberately failed to disclose that he had been prescribed medical marijuana in October 
2008, even though he possessed a security clearance. Applicant admitted the allegation 
in his Answer to the SOR, but during the hearing denied deliberately failing to disclose 
the fact because he had never used the prescription and did not think the information 
was relevant.82 The topic never was raised in the interview and Applicant never even 
thought to mention it.83 
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 During his abbreviated military career, Applicant was awarded the Navy and 
Marine Corps Achievement Medal, Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal (two awards), 
Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal,

Deployment Ribbon, Expert Rifle Badge, Expert Pistol Badge, and the National Defense 
Service Medal.84 During his civilian career, he was awarded a number of certificates of 
appreciation, performer recognition awards, and team achievement awards.85 
Applicant’s supervisors and coworkers, all of whom are retired Marine or Naval officers, 
are very supportive of Applicant’s application for a security clearance. They have 
characterized Applicant as a hard worker with initiative, strong moral fabric, selfless 
commitment, loyalty, honesty, dedication, maturity, high integrity, trustworthiness, and 
reliability.86  
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”87 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”88   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider

all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”89 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.90  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”91 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”92 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Analysis 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 30:       
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 31(a), “a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses” is potentially 
disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 31(c), an Aallegation or admission of criminal 
conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or 
convicted,@ may raise security concerns. Also, if the “individual is currently on parole or 
probation,” AG ¶ 31(d) may apply. As noted above, Applicant was charged with petty 
theft in 1996, DWI in 2006, a variety of allegations under the UCMJ in 2006, DWI in 
2007, and a variety of allegations in 2008. While the 1996 charge was dismissed, the 
2006 UCMJ charges were dismissed, and two of the 2008 charges were dismissed, 
Applicant was convicted of the 2006 and 2007 DWIs and two of the 2008 charges. He 
remains on probation until February 2012. Accordingly, AG ¶¶ 31(a), 31(c), and 31(d) 
have been established.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG ¶ 32(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.@ Also, where there is “evidence that the person did not commit the offense,” 
AG ¶ 32(c) may apply. Similarly, AG ¶ 32(d) may apply where “there is evidence of 
successful rehabilitation: including but not limited to the passage of time without 
recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, 
good employment record, or constructive community involvement.”  
 
As to the 2006 criminal allegations under the UCMJ, Applicant was exonerated 
following an Article 32 Investigation and the charges were dropped. I am satisfied that 
Applicant did not commit the offenses for which he was charged, or possibly satisfied 
the convening authority that the charges could not be proven. AG ¶ 32(c) applies. 
 
Applicant’s two DWI convictions occurred in 2006 and 2007. He completed 
alcohol education and treatment programs, and regularly attends AA meetings. While 
he continues to consume moderate amounts of alcohol, with the ultimate goal of 
abstinence, since the 2007 incident – approximately three and one-half years ago – 
there has been no recurrence of such alcohol-related incidents. In December 2008, 
Applicant started seeing a psychologist to “get back on the straight and narrow” 
because of the three incidents since his return from Iraq. The psychologist’s preliminary 
 
12 
                                      
 
diagnostic impression was that Applicant had an adjustment disorder with disturbance 
of conduct, and following psychological treatment and testing, the psychologist opined 
that Applicant’s diagnosis was a form of PTSD. As to those two alcohol-related 
incidents, the passage of time, outstanding performance as a government contractor, 
and the completion of the court-imposed sentences, all point to evidence of successful 
rehabilitation. AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 32(d) apply.  
 
As to the 2008 charges related to the possession and cultivation of marijuana 
and the theft of electrical service, it is clear that Applicant was convicted of possession 
of marijuana for sale, a felony, and cultivating marijuana, a misdemeanor. The electrical 
theft charges were dismissed as part of his plea agreement. While Applicant denies 
having been involved in the enterprise, his inconsistent statements regarding his 
knowledge of the tenant’s activities is troublesome and leads me to conclude that 
Applicant has something to hide. Furthermore, Applicant is still on probation. Under 
these circumstances, while there is some evidence of rehabilitation, it is simply too soon 
to conclude that Applicant’s 2008 criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. AG ¶¶ 32(a) and 
32(d) partially apply.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(b), “deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant 
facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other 
official government representative,” may raise security concerns. Similarly, under AG ¶ 
16(e), “personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in 
activities which, if known, may affect the person’s personal, professional, or community 
standing. . . ” may raise security concerns.  
 
Applicant’s omissions in his responses to inquiries in the OPM interview, of 
information pertaining to his tenant’s criminal conduct and involvement with marijuana 
and the theft of electrical services, provide sufficient evidence to examine if Applicant’s 
comments were deliberate falsifications pertaining to critical information, as alleged in 
the SOR, or were the result of confusion or misunderstanding on his part. I had ample 
opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and deportment, 
appraise the way in which he responded to questions, assess his candor or 
evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his testimony. Applicant’s positions 
 
13 
                                      
 
                                                          
regarding his knowledge of the tenant’s actions pertaining to both the marijuana and the 
electrical box are inconsistent. He claimed he was both unaware of the activity, and that 
he knew, but failed to report it.  
 
During that interview, Applicant said he knew there was marijuana in the rental 
property because he had smelled it, but he was unaware that the tenant had been 
cultivating marijuana in the house. He also stated that he had failed to notice that the 
tenant had tapped into the electric box of surrounding neighbors. That information was 
not entirely accurate, for in his subsequent answers to interrogatories in August 2009, 
Applicant acknowledged knowing that the tenant was growing marijuana and that the 
electrical box had been tampered with, but he failed to report those facts because of the 
current real estate market situation. He admitted he was not truthful when he answered 
the SOR. During the hearing, he reverted back to his original position about not actually 
knowing what his tenant had done. AG ¶¶ 16(b) and 16(e) have been established.93  
 
As to the allegation that during the same OPM interview, Applicant deliberately 
failed to disclose that he had been prescribed medical marijuana in October 2008, even 
though he possessed a security clearance, Applicant admitted the allegation in his 
Answer to the SOR, but during the hearing denied deliberately failing to disclose the fact 
because he had never used the prescription and did not think the information was 
relevant. He explained that the topic was not raised in the interview and Applicant never 
even thought to mention it. AG ¶¶ 16(b) and 16(e) have been established. 
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. If “the offense is so minor, or so much time has 
passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” AG ¶ 17(c) may apply. Also, AG ¶ 17(d) 
may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to 
change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, 
circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate 
behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.”  
 
Applicant’s inconsistencies with regard to his tenant’s activities continue, but his 
explanation as to the issue of the prescription for medical marijuana is consistent and 
compelling. The interview in question occurred in February 2009, nearly two and one-
half years ago. Applicant obtained counseling in an effort to alleviate the stressors, 
93 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally 
permissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case 
under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to 
explain the omission. 
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). 
 
14 
                                      
 
circumstances, or factors that caused his untrustworthy, unreliable, or otherwise 
inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. There is substantial 
evidence of Applicant’s outstanding reputation and previous gallant service to our 
Nation. Several character references concur in an assessment that Applicant is 
trustworthy and exhibits the highest standards of ethical conduct and moral character. 
Nevertheless, despite the length of the period since his interview, in light of some 
continuing inconsistencies, there is some doubt as to Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) partially apply. 
 
Guideline H, Drug Involvement 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in 
AG & 24:      
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and 
include: 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds 
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 
1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and 
(2) inhalants and other similar substances; 
(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a 
manner that deviates from approved medical direction. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 25(a), “any drug abuse (see above definition),” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 25(c), “illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia,” may 
raise security concerns. In addition, AG ¶ 25(g) may apply if there was “any illegal drug 
use after being granted a security clearance.” In October 2008, while Applicant 
possessed a security clearance, Applicant was convicted of possession of marijuana 
and cultivating marijuana. There is no evidence that he used marijuana. AG ¶¶ 25(a), 
and 25(g) have not been established. Because of the conviction pertaining to the 
possession and cultivation of marijuana, AG ¶ 25(c) has been established.   
  The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG ¶ 26(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on 
 
15 
                                      
 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Under AG ¶ 26(b), 
drug involvement concerns may also be mitigated where there is a demonstrated intent 
not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any 
violation. 
Applicant was the landlord of a tenant who cultivated marijuana. Although 
Applicant was convicted of possession of marijuana and cultivating marijuana, other 
than the relationship between landlord and tenant and the conviction, there is nothing to 
connect Applicant to the marijuana. Applicant is still on probation. The activity happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. However, Applicant’s inconsistent 
statements about the enterprise cast some doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant’s association with his psychologist, 
physician, and AA, all support his efforts to turn his life around and clearly demonstrate 
an intent not to abuse any drugs in the future. He has paid dearly for his relationship 
with his tenant, both in terms of reputation, criminal record, military career, and 
finances. He has devoted his life to his daughter and his country. AG ¶¶ 26(a) and 26(b) 
partially apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
 
16 
                                      
 
                                                          
There is substantial evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant 
is a good parent. Additionally, he was a good Marine who had deployed to the combat 
zone and returned with an alcohol problem and a version of PTSD. Applicant started 
seeing a psychologist to “get back on the straight and narrow” because of the three 
incidents since his return from Iraq. The passage of time, Applicant’s adapting to 
therapy, participating in AA, his outstanding performance as a government contractor, 
and his completing the court-imposed sentences, except for the continuing period of 
probation, all point to evidence of successful rehabilitation.  
 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
In 1996, Applicant was charged with petty theft, but managed to escape the 
consequences when the charge was subsequently dismissed. He was arrested and 
convicted of DWI in 2006 and 2007. In 2008, he was arrested and convicted for 
possession and cultivation of marijuana. Applicant is still on probation. During a 
February 2009 OPM interview, he lied. His subsequent explanations are inconsistent. 
 
I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.94 Applicant’s 
alcohol abuse ceased in 2007, and has not recurred. While he aspires to abstinence, he 
possesses a new appreciation of the negative aspects of excessive alcohol 
consumption, and has a support group. His unfortunate relationship with his tenant 
exposed him to some sharp realities of life and he has focused on his daughter and his 
civilian job. He forfeited an outstanding military career. It is difficult to determine which 
version of the facts regarding his 2008 charges and convictions are the truth in light of 
his constant inconsistencies. See AG && 2(a)(1) through 2(a)(9). 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude he has failed to mitigate the criminal conduct, 
personal conduct, and drug involvement security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings
