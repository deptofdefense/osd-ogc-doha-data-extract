GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding foreign influence.  
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 16, 2006, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on August 24, 2010.2 On an unspecified date, DOHA furnished him 
another set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on August 24, 2010.3 
1 Item 5 (SF 86, dated March 16, 2006). 
 
2 Item 6 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated August 24, 2010). 
 
3 Item 7 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated August 24, 2010).

On November 19, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant 
to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 21, 2010. In a sworn statement, dated 
February 5, 2011, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the 
Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant on March 15, 
2011,4 and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after receipt of 
the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. 
Applicant received the FORM on March 30, 2011. On April 26, 2011, Applicant 
submitted a letter with eight attachments. The case was assigned to me on May 27, 
2011. 
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain 
enumerated facts pertaining to the Republic of Sudan (Sudan), appearing in 12 written 
submissions. Facts are proper for administrative notice when they are verifiable by an 
authorized source and relevant and material to the case. In this instance, the 
Government relied on source information regarding Sudan in publications of the White 
House,5 U.S. Department of State,6 and the Congressional Research Service.7 
4 The cover page of the FORM is dated March 8, 2011, but the letter transmitting the FORM to Applicant, as 
well as the letter transmitting the entire file to me, both indicate the FORM was not sent to Applicant until March 15, 
2011.

After weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the 
relevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 
201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts,8 as set 
forth below under the Sudan subsection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant generally admitted all of the factual 
allegations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.d.) of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been specified.  He has been 
employed as a linguist/interpreter for the U.S. Army with his current employer, a 
government contractor, since March 2006.9 In this position, he has served in hazardous 
positions in Iraq, questioning detainees, supporting liaison with Iraqi police, 
accompanying U.S. military members on patrols, sweeping missions, “cordon and 
knocks,” raids, and improvised explosive device (IED) removal missions.10 He was 
injured during one mission when his vehicle was struck by an IED.11 Over the years, 
Applicant held a number of positions with various employers. He was unemployed from 
February 1994 until March 2000;12 an assembler from April 2000 until July 2000;13 a 
temporary employee of an unspecified responsibility in August 2000;14 unemployed 
from August 2000 until September 2000;15 an assembler from September 2000 until 
February 2001;16 a pizza deliverer from February 2001 until March 2001;17 an electrical

8 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See 
McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 
n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 
at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice 
facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & 
Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize 
authoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing 
internet sources for numerous documents).

Applicant was born in 1961 in Sudan.24 The record is silent regarding Applicant’s  
early life in Sudan. He left Sudan in the 1980s because of the ethnic cleansing and 
government atrocities, and went to Egypt to attend school.25 He obtained a degree in 
November 1991.26 In January 1999, Applicant was married in Egypt to a citizen of 
Sudan.27 Applicant and his wife immigrated to the United States in January 2000,28 and 
they both became naturalized U.S. citizens in November 2005.29 Applicant and his wife 
have two children, a daughter born in Egypt in November 1999, and a son born in the 
United States in July 2002.30 As refugees in Egypt, Applicant’s daughter was not 
granted Egyptian citizenship upon birth,31 but when Applicant and his wife were 
naturalized, his daughter also became a naturalized U.S. citizen.32 Applicant’s 
immediate family resides in the United States.33

When Applicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens, they renounced 
their Sudanese citizenship34 and took an oath of allegiance to the United States.  That 
oath included the words:35 
 
I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and 
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or 
sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen.  
 
Applicant’s Sudanese-born father is deceased.36 His mother was born in Sudan 
and is a retired farmer, still residing in Sudan.37 Applicant has three brothers, a half-
brother, a sister, and a half-sister, all born in Sudan, and still residing there.38 His half-
brother is retired from a position with a Sudanese school;39 two brothers are welders;40 
one brother is a restaurant owner;41 and his sisters are housewives.42 Neither his 
mother, nor any of his siblings, has ever had any affiliation with the Sudanese military or 
intelligence service.43 His half-brother worked for the Sudanese government in an 
unspecified position believed to be through his past affiliation with the school.44 
Applicant’s mother and siblings have never held political affiliations.45 Applicant’s 
mother-in-law was born in Sudan, and she still resides there, working as a 
housekeeper.46 He also has an uncle who, in 2007, was serving in the Sudanese 
military.47

Applicant’s relationships with his extended family have evolved over the years. 
For an unspecified number of years, he had not had any personal contact with his family 
since he departed Sudan for Egypt.48 From 1984 until 1999, he maintained mail contact 
with various family members several times per year.49 Things changed somewhat after 
he came to the United States. In 2007, he maintained monthly telephone contact with 
two brothers.50 No other family member had telephones.51 Applicant had no contact 
with his uncle.52 From 2000 until 2010, Applicant had telephone contact with various 
family members once every few months.53 He has also sent various family members 
small amounts of money (between $200 and $500) every few months to once per 
year.54 Applicant visited his mother and siblings on two occasions since 1984: in 1987 
and 2008.55 Applicant has no financial interests in Suda 56
 
Applicant and his wife initiated efforts to sponsor various family members for 
permanent entry into the United States.57 In August 2010, in response to Applicant’s 
petition, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Citizenship and Immigration 
Service (USCIS), commenced immigration action for Applicant’s mother.58 The petitions 
pertaining to Applicant’s mother-in-law and two sisters-in-law were already approved in 
2010.59 Applicant’s nephew arrived in the United States in August 2010.60 Applicant is 
preparing to bring the rest of his foreign family members to the United States 
“gradually.”61

Character References and Work Performance 
 
 The commanding officer and the officer in charge of the human intelligence 
exploitation teams of the U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps with whom Applicant 
worked in Iraq are effusive in their praise for Applicant. For example, the commanding 
officer of one Marine team commented:62  
 
He directly contributed his efforts to provide tactical information, enforce 
our commitment to safeguard local Iraqis, and performed numerous raids 
that led to the capture of insurgents who have engaged in attacks against 
coalition forces (CF) and Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). . . . 
 
Throughout the most difficult of situations, including stress, combat, and 
heat, [Applicant] displayed an unfettered professional attitude. [Applicant] 
seamlessly integrates according to the operational environment, and 
quickly adapts to the dynamic and often spontaneous situations required . 
. . in support of a [human intelligence exploitation team]. . . . 
 
[Applicant] has been a trusted team player and is a part of our family. He 
has been a mentor to the younger Marines and a pleasure to have with us 
in this sometimes-uncomfortable environment. . . . 
 
[Applicant] is one of a kind in terms of selflessness, drive and linguistic 
skill. I would gladly serve with [Applicant] in Combat or Garrison. 
 
Sudan 
 
Sudan has been designated by the U.S. Department of State as a state sponsor 
of terrorism since 1993. While Sudan continues to pursue counterterrorism operations 
directly involving threats to U.S. interests and personnel in Sudan, the Sudanese 
Government openly supports Hamas, considering its members freedom fighters. 
Nevertheless, in January 2011, the United States announced that the process of 
withdrawing the “state sponsor of terrorism designation” once Sudan complied with the 
previously agreed-upon Comprehensive Peace Agreement of 2005 (CPA), as well as 
current U.S. policy. That policy, announced in 2009, was essentially: 1) achieve a 
definitive end to conflict, gross human rights abuses and genocide in Darfur; 2) 
implementation of the CPA, resulting in a peaceful post-2011 Sudan, or an orderly path 
toward two separate and viable states at peace with each other; and 3) ensure that 
Sudan does not provide a safe haven for international terrorism.  
 
The Sudanese Government has engaged in significant human rights abuses, 
including extrajudicial and other unlawful killings by government forces; torture, 
beatings, rape, and other cruel and inhumane treatment by security forces; arbitrary 
arrest and detention; executive interference with the judiciary and denial of due process; 
restrictions on citizens’ privacy; restrictions on the freedoms of speech, press,

assembly, association, religion, and movement; trafficking in persons; violence and 
discrimination against women and ethnic minorities; and forced labor. The government 
monitors Internet communications and the security service reads e-mail messages 
between private citizens. U.S. citizens are at risk when traveling in Sudan. Terrorists are 
known to operate in Sudan and continue to seek opportunities to carry out attacks 
against U.S. interests. A wide network of government informants conducts surveillance 
in schools, universities, markets, workplaces, and neighborhoods.   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”63 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”64   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”65 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and it has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
63 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). 
 
64 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended 
and modified.    
 
65 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.66  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”67 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”68 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline B, Foreign Influence 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in 
AG ¶ 6:       
Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by 
any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should 
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such 
considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United

States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a 
risk of terrorism. 
The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, 
as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in 
a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is 
sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the 
compromise of classified information.69 Applicant’s relationship with his mother, his 
siblings, and his wife’s mother and siblings, all of whom are citizens and residents of 
Sudan, are current security concerns for the Government. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 7(a), “contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, 
friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact 
creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or 
coercion” is potentially disqualifying. Similarly, under AG ¶ 7(b), “connections to a 
foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest 
between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the 
individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that 
information” may raise security concerns. Also, under AG ¶ 7(d), “sharing living quarters 
with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a 
heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,” is 
potentially disqualifying. I find AG ¶¶ 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply in this case. However, 
the security significance of these identified conditions requires further examination of 
Applicant’s respective relationships with his family members who are Sudanese citizen-
residents, to determine the degree of “heightened risk” or potential conflict of interest.  
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from foreign influence. Under AG ¶ 8(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the 
country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those 
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a 
position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, 
organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.” Similarly, AG ¶ 8(b) may 
apply where the evidence shows:  
there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of 
loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is 
so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships 
and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any 
conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. 
In addition, AG ¶ 8(c) may apply where “contact or communication with foreign citizens 
is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for 
foreign influence or exploitation.” In this instance, Applicant’s relationship with his 
69 See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 8, 2001).

mother and siblings, or his mother-in-law and his wife’s siblings, is neither casual nor 
infrequent. Accordingly, AG ¶ 8(c) does not apply as it pertains to them. AG ¶ 8(c) does, 
however, apply to his apparently non-existent relationship with his uncle. 
In assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant’s 
relatives or associates in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant 
factors, including the totality of an applicant’s conduct and circumstances. One such 
factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. In that regard, it is 
important to consider the character of the foreign power in question, including the 
government and entities controlled by the government within the relevant foreign 
country.  Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is limited to countries that are hostile to the 
United States.70 In fact, the Appeal Board has cautioned against “reliance on overly 
simplistic distinctions between ‘friendly’ nations and ‘hostile’ nations when adjudicating 
cases under Guideline B.”71 
 
Nevertheless, the relationship between a foreign government and the United 
States may be relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it 
controls is likely to attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to take action against the 
United States. It is reasonable to presume that the nature of the government in Sudan 
and the relationship it has with the United States, may make it more likely that Sudan 
would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through relatives or associates in Sudan. 
 
As noted above, the absence of Sudanese government contacts or attempted 
contacts with Applicant or his mother, siblings, mother-in-law, or his wife’s siblings, or 
the apparent absence, so far, of coercive means to obtain sensitive information, does 
not eliminate the possibility that Sudan would employ some coercive or non-coercive 
measures in an attempt to exploit a relative.  There is no evidence that Applicant’s 
extended family members are, or have been, political activists, challenging the policies 
of the Sudanese government; that terrorists have approached or threatened Applicant 
or his extended family members; that the Sudanese government has approached 
Applicant; or that his extended family members currently engage in activities that would 
bring attention to themselves.  
 
Nevertheless, considering the Sudanese government and its position with 
respect to human rights, its aggressive intelligence operations against its own citizens, 
and its relationship with the United States, it is foreseeable that Applicant’s extended 
family members could be a means through which Applicant could come to the attention 
of the regime. They could also be the vehicle through which Sudan might attempt to 
coerce Applicant. The obscurity of Applicant’s extended family members is not a 
meaningful basis for concluding that they are beyond the reach of the regime. The 
Appeal Board has consistently held that factors such as an applicant’s relatives’ 
obscurity or the failure of foreign authorities to contact those relatives in the past do not 
provide a meaningful measure of whether an applicant’s circumstances pose a security

10, 2002).

risk, when, for example, the relatives are subject to the authority of a regime that is 
hostile to the United States and has a dismal human rights record.72  
 
However, the significance of the heightened risk is minimized by several factors. 
Applicant is willing to risk his life as part of his duties on behalf of the U.S. combat 
forces in Iraq. He is fully aware of those risks, and has survived several incidents, one 
of which resulted in his being wounded. These circumstances demonstrate that 
Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist 
group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him.73 Applicant’s extended family 
members are in various stages of the process of immigrating to the United States. Also, 
Applicant, a civilian veteran of combat serving in a combat zone with the U.S. military, 
has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., both to his wife 
and children, and to the United States and its military services, that he can be expected 
to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest AG ¶¶ 8(a) and 8(b) apply. 
Even if AG ¶ 8(b) does not fully apply, the security concerns are mitigated under the 
whole-person analysis below. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant’s “closest family” - his wife 
and children - are American citizens residing in the United States. His extended family 
members are Sudanese citizens residing in Sudan, hoping to immigrate to the United 
States. Applicant is not vulnerable to direct coercion or exploitation so long as he 
remains outside of Sudan. However, should he return to Sudan, his vulnerability to 
72 See ISCR Case No. 07-18283 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-13696 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 
9, 2009). 
 
73 See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). 
 
13 
                                      
 
direct coercion or exploitation rises significantly. His vulnerability to indirect coercion or 
exploitation through his extended family members while they remain in Sudan is 
possible. However, when Applicant becomes successful in bringing his extended family 
members to the United States, these security concerns will no longer be present, unless 
they return to visit family or friends living in Sudan.  
 
Applicant is an interpreter for the U.S. Army with his current employer. In this 
position, he has served with U.S. military combat forces in hazardous positions in Iraq, 
questioning detainees, supporting liaison with Iraqi police, accompanying U.S. military 
members on patrols, sweeping missions, “cordon and knocks,” raids, and IED removal 
missions. He was injured during one mission when his vehicle was struck by an IED. 
 
A Guideline B decision concerning Sudan must take into consideration the 
geopolitical situation in that country, as well as the potential dangers existing there. 
Sudan, an active state sponsor of terrorism, is not known to conduct aggressive 
intelligence operations and economic espionage against the United States. (See AG && 
2(a)(1) through 2(a)(9).) 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without significant questions or doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline B:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
