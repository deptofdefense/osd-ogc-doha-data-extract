HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists eight delinquent debts totaling 
$132,916. He paid or settled six debts. Financial considerations concerns are mitigated. 
However, he intentionally failed to disclose derogatory information on his June 20, 2007 
security clearance application. Personal conduct concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 20, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
October 18, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) 
and E (personal conduct). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether Applicant’s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On November 24, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On January 25, 2011, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On April 
5, 2011, Applicant’s hearing was held using video teleconference. At the hearing, 
Department Counsel offered ten exhibits (GE 1-10) (Tr. 21), and Applicant offered 33 
exhibits. (Tr. 25-35; AE A-AG) There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-10 and 
AE A-AG. (Tr. 22, 35) Additionally, I admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant’s 
response to the SOR as hearing exhibits. (HE 1-3) The record was held open until April 
12, 2011, to permit Applicant to submit additional evidence. (Tr. 49, 83-84, 112, 123) 
After the hearing, Applicant provided eight pages of documents, which were admitted. 
(AE AH) On April 12, 2011, I received the hearing transcript.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response addressed each SOR allegation in ¶ 1 stating: 1.a 
(denied); 1.b and 1.c (admit, but debt is resolved); 1.d (admit—explained to 
investigator); 1.e and 1.f (deny because unaware of debt); and 1.g and 1.h (deny 
because debt paid). He admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d, and 2.g. In 
connection with SOR ¶¶ 2.e and 2.f, he stated that he admitted the allegation, but 
understood that the two convictions were removed from his record. (HE 3) His 
admissions are accepted as factual findings. 
 
Applicant is a 38-year-old trainer working for a defense contractor. (Tr. 8, 36) He 
graduated from high school in 1991. (Tr. 8) He has not attended college. (Tr. 8) He 
served in the Marine Corps from 1995 to 1997, and he received a general discharge 
under honorable conditions. (Tr. 8-9) He married in 1999, and he has three children who 
are 7, 10, and 11 years old. (Tr. 9)  
 
Applicant has worked for his employer for four years, and his primary function is 
training personnel on how to counter improvised explosive devices. (Tr. 37) He served 
one year in Iraq and two years in Afghanistan. (Tr. 39) His six-page resume provides a 
detailed description of his qualifications, education, training, certifications, work 
experience, awards, honors, and security clearance. (AE U)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant worked for the same employer from 1997 to 2007, prior to receiving 
employment with his current employer in 2007. (Tr. 41-43) When he went to work for his 
 
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits.

current employer in 2007, his annual pay increased from about $30,000 to about 
$100,000. (Tr. 43, 74-75) He has never been unemployed. (Tr. 42) He encountered 
financial difficulties in 2000 after his second child was born, and his spouse could not 
work outside their home. (Tr. 40-41) He made some poor financial decisions; however, 
he emphasized he was working diligently to resolve his financial issues. (Tr. 73)  
 
Applicant’s SOR lists eight delinquent debts totaling $132,916. The status of the 
eight debts listed on Applicant’s SOR is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a debt ($140)—PAID. On March 23, 2011, Applicant paid the creditor 
$148. (Tr. 45; AE B)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b debt ($356)—PAID. Applicant paid this debt in 2006. (Tr. 46-47; AE 
AH at 4)  
    
SOR ¶ 1.c car loan ($11,163)—PAID. In 2004, Applicant purchased a van, and 
the creditor voluntarily repossessed it that same year.2 (Tr. 50-51) He did not pay the 
delinquency because he believed it was charged off, and the creditor was not pursuing 
collection. (Tr. 51) On March 23, 2011, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $7,000. 
(AE A at 3) In 2011, Applicant borrowed $10,000 on his truck, which did not have a lien 
on it. (Tr. 71-72) On March 25, 2011, Applicant paid $7,000 to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c, 
resolving this debt. (Tr. 52; AE A at 1-2) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d mortgage loan ($120,000)—REFUTED. In 2002, Applicant 
purchased a residence. (Tr. 57) In 2006, his mortgage company foreclosed on his 
residence. (Tr. 56) His initial mortgage was for $120,000. (Tr. 59) He did not know 
whether there was a deficiency after the house was foreclosed. (Tr. 59) After the 
hearing, Applicant provided an account statement showing that in 2006 there was a 
transaction amount of $115,173. (Tr. 60; AE AH at 3, 6-8) The “Principal Paid” column 
shows $115,173 followed by zeros. Id. The “Current Balances” section shows zero 
owed for principal and interest. (AE AH at 6)   
 
 
2 Section 27b of Applicant’s 2007 SF 86 seeks information about “property repossessed for any 
reason” in the last seven years. (GE 1) Applicant did not disclose his repossessed vehicle and foreclosure 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. (Tr. 69-70; GE 1) The SOR did not allege that he failed to provide this derogatory 
financial information on his 2007 SF 86. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the 
Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered 
stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). In light of the lack of notice in the SOR about his failure to disclose this derogatory 
financial information on his SF 86, I decline to consider this derogatory information for any purpose.

SOR ¶ 1.e medical debt ($52)—PAID. On March 24, 2011, Applicant paid $71 
to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e, resolving this debt. (Tr. 60-61; AE C, AE AH at 2) The debt 
is not on Applicant’s current credit report. (Tr. 61) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f medical debt ($1,105)—TRANSFERRED. On March 22, 2011, the 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.f wrote that the creditor no longer possessed the debt. (Tr. 61-62; 
AE D at 1-2) The creditor’s letter and SOR did not provide notice of the subsequent 
holder of this debt. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h checks ($55 and $45)—PAID. In 2004, Applicant wrote bad 
checks to two gas stations. (Tr. 66) The same collection company is seeking payment of 
both debts. He thought the debts were previously resolved. (Tr. 66) On March 23, 2011, 
Applicant paid $329 to the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h, resolving these two debts. 
(Tr. 65-67; AE E-F) 
 
 Applicant’s 2010 personal financial statement (PFC) includes monthly net income 
($6,743), monthly expenses ($1,300), monthly debt payments ($2,129), and monthly net 
remainder ($3,314). (Tr. 73-74; GE 2 at 36) His assets total $47,519, including $27,619 
in a 401K account. Id. As of the date of his hearing, his net income is down to about 
$5,700, his expenses and debt payments have increased, and his current monthly 
remainder is substantially less. (Tr. 77-83)   
 
Personal Conduct 
 
 In 1991 when Applicant was 18 years old, he and a friend stole an envelope 
containing $8,000 from the family of his girlfriend. (Tr. 86-87) Applicant was arrested 
and charged with larceny over $100, a felony. (Tr. 84-85; SOR ¶ 2.a) He was sentenced 
to 11 days in jail, to 36 months of probation, to community service, and to pay a fine and 
restitution. (Tr. 84-85) Applicant’s parents paid restitution to the victim. (Tr. 88) In 2009, 
Applicant completed reimbursement of the restitution that he received from his parents. 
(Tr. 88-89)  
 
 In about May 1996, Applicant drove while impaired by alcohol, the police 
apprehended him, and he missed formation because he was still detained by the police. 
He received non-judicial punishment (NJP) for being absent from his appointed place of 
duty and for physically controlling a passenger car while impaired by alcohol, in violation 
of Articles 86 and 111, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. §§ 886 and 
911. (Tr. 89-92; GE 8; SOR ¶ 2.b) His commander imposed punishment of forfeiture of 
$400, reduction to pay grade E-2 (suspended for six months), and 60 days restriction. 
Id. 
 
In about October 1996, Applicant was charged with wrongful use of cocaine, in 
violation of Article 112a, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. § 912a. (Tr. 89-90; GE 9; SOR ¶ 2.c) He said 
he had no idea why he came up positive for cocaine on the urinalysis test. (Tr. 92) He 
denied knowingly using cocaine. (Tr. 92-94) He admitted that he told the judge under 
oath during the providence inquiry that he knowingly used cocaine. (Tr. 105-06) He said 
he had to tell the judge that he “snorted the cocaine” in order to have his guilty plea 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
accepted. (Tr. 106) This was the first time he was ever involved with cocaine. (Tr. 107) 
In October 1996, he pleaded guilty at a special court-martial and was sentenced to 
forfeiture of $300.00 pay per month for three months, to 30 days confinement to run 
concurrently with 30 days restriction, and to reduction to pay grade E-2. (GE 9) 
 
In about April 1997, Applicant was involuntarily processed for administrative 
separation from the U.S. Marine Corps. (Tr. 94; SOR ¶ 2.d) He received a general 
discharge, and the narrative reason for his discharge was “misconduct.”  
 
Applicant’s June 20, 2007 SF 86 asked, “23: Your Police Record—For this item, 
report information regardless of whether the record in your case has been ‘sealed’ or 
otherwise stricken from the court record. The single exception to this requirement is for 
certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act for which the court 
issued an expungement order under the authority of 21 U.S.C. 844 or 18 U.S.C. 3607. 
Answer the following questions. a. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any 
felony offense? (Include those under Uniform Code of Military Justice).” Applicant 
answered “No” to this question. (Tr. 95-96) Applicant said he was only 18 when he 
committed the offense, and he thought his conviction in 1991 for larceny over $100 was 
going to be “erased—gone” after he completed his sentence. (Tr. 96-97, 109-110) He 
thought, “[i]t can go away.” (Tr. 96; SOR ¶ 2.e) 
 
Section 23d of Applicant’s June 20, 2007 SF 86 also asked, “Have you ever been 
charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?” Applicant 
answered “No” to this question, even though he was convicted of using cocaine at a 
court-martial in 1996. He said he did not list the offense because the judge told him he 
could “still survive,” and he “could still move on in life.” (Tr. 98, 111-12) He completed 
his punishment and wanted to put it behind him. (Tr. 98-99) He attempted to remember 
his thought process or mental state in 2007 when he completed his SF 86; however, he 
concluded that he could not remember why he did not disclose his court-martial 
conviction. (Tr. 101) His violation of Article 111, UCMJ (driving while impaired by 
alcohol) is not pertinent to this question because an NJP allegation is not a “charge” 
under the MCM, 2008, R.C.M. 307.   
 
Applicant’s June 20, 2007 SF 86 asked, “19: Your Military Record—Answer the 
following question. Have you ever received other than an honorable discharge from the 
military?” (SOR ¶ 2.g) He said he answered “No” to this question because “[i]t was 
still—it wasn’t other than honorable, it was a general discharge under honorable 
conditions.” (Tr. 101)  
 
Applicant’s colleagues, subordinates, and supervisors lauded his performance 
and character in their statements. (AE G-Q, AE AF, AE AG) He shows initiative, 
integrity, and attention to detail. Id. He is a very professional and dedicated trainer. Id. 
He is honest, prompt, reliable, ethical, loyal, professional, responsible, steadfast, 
patriotic, and diligent. Id. He is an asset to his team, company, and country. Id. On 
March 13, 2009, he received a commander’s award for civilian service in Afghanistan. 
(AE R) On September 26, 2009, he received a certificate of appreciation from a unit 
maintenance control officer. (AE S) On December 17, 2010, he received his instructor

certification from a community college. (AE T) His employee evaluations show that he is 
a diligent, responsible, and professional employee. (AE V-Y) The security officer at 
Applicant’s company and various certifications indicate Applicant has been compliant 
with security and training requirements, cooperative, and security oriented. (AE Y to AE)   
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”;  
and “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(Internal citation omitted.) Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, and his statement at his hearing. Applicant’s SOR lists 
eight delinquent debts totaling $132,916. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(e) do not apply. Applicant did not receive 
financial counseling, and he did not disclose an extraordinary reason, such as 
unemployment or divorce, to explain his delinquent debts. He did not provide 
documentation showing he disputed any delinquent debts. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) applies. Applicant has a good understanding of how to resolve his 
debts. He acted in good faith with respect to all SOR debts.3 He paid six of them, he 
has taken steps to determine the status of his mortgage debt, and one debt was 
transferred. He may not owe anything on his mortgage because his mortgage company 
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

Personal conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative;  
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable 
behavior . . . ; and (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations . . . ; and 
 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that 
creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) 
engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, 
professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in 
any activity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in 
the United States and may serve as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the 
foreign security or intelligence service or other group. 
 
All five conditions apply. In 1991, Applicant and a friend stole $8,000 from his 
girlfriend’s family, and he was convicted of a felony-level larceny offense. In May 1996, 
he drove while impaired by alcohol and was late for formation the next day, resulting in 
NJP. In October 1996, he used cocaine and pleaded guilty to cocaine use. I do not 
believe his initial statement at the hearing that he did not know why he tested positive 
on the urinalysis test for the presence of cocaine in his body. His statement under oath 
at his providence hearing that he snorted cocaine is more credible than his denial of 
knowing cocaine use. When he completed his SF 86, he falsely denied that he had a 
felony-level conviction, a drug-related offense, and that he received less than an 
honorable discharge.   
 
AG ¶ 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns 
including: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
AG ¶¶ 17(a), 17(b), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(g) do not apply to a sufficient degree to 
mitigate any SOR allegations. AG ¶ 17(c) applies to the information in SOR ¶¶ 2.a to 
2.d. The most recent event was in April 1997, 14 years ago. These offenses no longer 
cast doubt on Applicant’s trustworthiness. AG ¶ 17(f) applies to SOR ¶ 2.g. Applicant 
believed that his general discharge under honorable conditions did not have to be 
disclosed because his discharge was under honorable conditions.  
 
Applicant’s deliberately false statements on his 2007 SF 86 about his felony-level 
larceny conviction and his court-martial conviction for using cocaine are not mitigated. 
He was not credible at his hearing about why he did not disclose this information. No 
one misled him into thinking this information should not be reported on his SF 86. The 
questions are clear, and his resume and good character evidence, for example, show 
that he is an intelligent and detail-oriented person. His false statements on his SF 86 
are serious and relatively recent. Personal conduct concerns are not mitigated.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. He served in the Marine Corps from 
1995 to 1997. In 1999, he married, and has three young children. He is a 38-year-old

trainer, who has worked for a defense contractor for the last four years, including three 
years in combat zones, where he trained personnel on countering improvised explosive 
devices. His security officer, personnel evaluations, supervisors, colleagues, and 
subordinates laud his dedication, performance and character. He received a 
commander’s award for civilian service in Afghanistan and several certificates of 
appreciation. There is no evidence of security violations. There is every indication that 
he is loyal to the United States and his employer. I give Applicant substantial credit for 
explaining and mitigating his financial circumstances. These factors show some 
responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial. He has not mitigated his deliberate and intentional falsification of his 
2007 SF 86. He knew he should have disclosed his felony-level larceny and court-
martial conviction for using cocaine on his SF 86, and he chose not to do so. His 
explanations are not credible.     
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated; however, personal conduct concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:      FOR APPLICANT 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a through 2d:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.e and 2.f:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.g:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
