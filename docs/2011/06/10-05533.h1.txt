HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 
January 2004, and the statement of reasons (SOR) lists 11 delinquent debts totaling 
$9,635. He made sufficient progress resolving his 11 SOR debts, and financial 
considerations concerns are mitigated at this time. He had three incidents resulting in 
three convictions for driving while intoxicated by alcohol (DUI), and his most recent DUI 
was on May 13, 2010. Alcohol consumption concerns are not mitigated and eligibility for 
access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 9, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
October 28, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR 
to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3) On January 
19, 2011, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. 
On February 2, 2011, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On March 22, 2011, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits 
(GE 1-5) (Tr. 19-20), and Applicant offered ten exhibits. (Tr. 21-24; AE A-J) There were 
no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-J. (Tr. 20, 24) Additionally, I admitted 
the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR as hearing exhibits. (HE 
1-3) On March 31, 2011, I received the transcript. I held the record open until April 29, 
2011. (Tr. 97, 122-23, 131) On April 28, 2011, Applicant submitted five additional 
exhibits. (AE K-O) There were no objections to Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits, and I 
admitted them into evidence. (AE K-O) 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
During the hearing, Applicant’s history of alcohol consumption was raised by his 
disclosure of two DUIs on his SF 86, and his conviction for a DUI, which occurred on 
May 13, 2010. (Tr. 95; GE 1) Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding 
three new allegations under the Alcohol Consumption Guideline:  
 
2.a. About July 2000, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He pleaded guilty and was 
fined $1,100. His driver’s license was suspended for six months. He was required to 
attend a 20-hour class on drinking and driving. (Tr. 99) 
 
2.b. About November 2001, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He pleaded guilty 
and received a fine. (Tr. 99) 
 
2.c. On May 13, 2010, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He pleaded guilty and was 
sentenced to pay a $700 fine. The court suspended his license for six months and 
placed him on probation for one year. The court ordered Applicant to receive alcohol 
counseling. (Tr. 99-100)  
   
I held the record open for 30 days after his hearing to permit him to submit post-hearing 
documents, and he waived his objection to this SOR amendment. (Tr. 96-101) I granted 
the motion to amend the SOR by adding the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a to 2.c.

Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e-1.i, 
and 1.k. His admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is a forty-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (Tr. 6) He has 
worked as a senior training instructor for his employer for two years. (Tr. 26) He does 
not currently require a security clearance; however, he will require a clearance in about 
18 months. (Tr. 27) He graduated from high school in 1990. (Tr. 6) He has attended 
college; however, he has not earned a degree. (Tr. 6) He served in the Marine Corps 
from 1988 to 1990. (Tr. 7) He said that while he was in the Marine Corps, he ate 
something at a party that was tainted with an illegal drug, and Applicant thought maybe 
it was marijuana or THC.2 (Tr. 8) He had a separation board; nevertheless, he said he 
was not sure what illegal drug he was accused of using. (Tr. 118, 119-21) He received a 
general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 7) He is not married, and he does 
not have any children. (Tr. 26) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In about 2006 or 2007, Applicant was unemployed for about three months on one 
occasion and for about six months on another occasion. (Tr. 34) He was also briefly 
unemployed in 2009. He indicated his delinquent debts resulted from decreased income 
due to unemployment. (Tr. 39) He hired one credit repair company, paid them $400 per 
month for three months, and then he realized nothing was being accomplished to 
resolve his debts. (Tr. 56, 115) He terminated his relationship with this credit repair 
company after payment of $1,200. 
 
In April 2010, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
interviewed Applicant about his history of alcohol consumption, his credit report, and his 
delinquent debts. (Tr. 69, 102; GE 2)  
  
 
1Some details have been excluded in order to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific 
information is available in the cited exhibits. 
 
2 The SOR did not allege that Applicant used illegal drugs and was discharged from the Marine 
Corps because of his illegal drug use. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the 
Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered 
stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). In light of the lack of notice in the SOR about the derogatory information about his illegal 
drug use while in the Marine Corps, I decline to consider this derogatory information for any purpose.

In March 2011, Applicant paid a credit counseling and debt resolution company, 
CCC, $75, as a retainer fee, and he provided a check to CCC for $389 to help him with 
his credit and to begin working with his creditors. (Tr. 56, 63, 70-71, 114; AE H) CCC 
plans to challenge all of the debts on his credit report. The debts that survive the 
challenge process will be addressed, in turn, through negotiation and settlement, one at 
a time. (Tr. 64, 116) Applicant promised to pay the substantiated debts. (Tr. 64) CCC 
will start negotiating and settling the smallest debts first. (Tr. 64-65) CCC told Applicant 
not to have any more contact with the SOR creditors. (Tr. 79) He is taking some credit 
classes to help him understand finances and credit issues. (Tr. 58) When he calculated 
his budget, he determined that he had about $500 left at the end of the month after 
paying his expenses and making payments on his debts. (Tr. 77-78) He did not have 
credit counseling; however, he did have a two-hour discussion about credit with a 
counselor. (Tr. 80) He uses an electronic budget to track his expenses and debt 
payments. (Tr. 81)  
 
Applicant’s SOR lists 12 issues of financial concern including a bankruptcy and 
11 debts totaling $9,635. The status of these financial issues is as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a 2004 Bankruptcy. Applicant and three others invested in a 
restaurant. (Tr. 28) Applicant was the restaurant’s chef and was not focused on financial 
matters. (Tr. 28) One of the partners cleaned out the partnership bank accounts. (Tr. 
28) Applicant estimated that between $75,000 and about $175,000 of his debt was 
discharged by a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in January 2004. (Tr. 29-33) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b medical debt ($125)—PAID. On December 9, 2010, Applicant paid 
the creditor $130 resolving this debt. (Tr. 37-38; AE A)  
    
SOR ¶ 1.c credit card debt ($487)—UNRESOLVED. In 2008, Applicant’s credit 
card account became delinquent. (Tr. 39-40) He did not pay the delinquency because 
he wanted to investigate the amount of the debt. (Tr. 41) The creditor was unable or 
unwilling to send a statement showing how the amount of the debt was calculated, so 
the debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 42-43)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d telecommunications debt ($86)—PAID. On December 6, 2010, 
Applicant paid this creditor $86, and this debt was resolved. (Tr. 43-44; AE B)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.e debt ($589)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant did not pay this debt 
because either the creditor was unable or unwilling to send a statement showing how 
the amount of the debt was calculated, or the creditor was unwilling to send verification 
of payment if the debt was paid. (Tr. 45-48)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f medical debt ($224)—UNRESOLVED. Applicant did not pay this debt 
because the creditor was unable or unwilling to provide him any information to explain 
the amount of the debt. (Tr. 49-50)  
 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
SOR ¶ 1.g personal loan ($5,420)—UNRESOLVED. Two or three years ago, 
Applicant borrowed about $3,500 for home repairs. (Tr. 50-52) CCC is supposed to help 
him resolve this debt. (Tr. 50-51) This creditor has not been paid anything. (Tr. 53)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.h telecommunications debt ($1,306)—UNRESOLVED. This debt 
became delinquent two or three years ago. (Tr. 53-54) Applicant has asked CCC to 
contest the debt because he disagrees with the amount. (Tr. 53-54)     
 
SOR ¶ 1.i credit card debt ($592)—UNRESOLVED. This debt became 
delinquent several years ago. (Tr. 58-60) Applicant did not pay the debt because he did 
not get sufficient assurance that he would receive a receipt for payment from the 
creditor. (Tr. 59-62) This is the next debt he plans to pay. (Tr. 62) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j credit card debt ($409)—PAID. On December 7, 2010, this creditor 
wrote that the debt was paid in full on December 6, 2010. (Tr. 65; AE C) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k medical debt ($284)—UNRESOLVED. When Applicant called this 
creditor and offered to pay the debt, the creditor wanted his home phone number 
(probably to verify Applicant’s identity for comparison purposes with the home number 
the creditor had on file). Applicant refused to provide his home phone number to the 
creditor. (Tr. 66) The creditor would not discuss the debt with him. (Tr. 66) He had no 
further contact with the creditor. (Tr. 66) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l debt ($113)—PAID. On December 10, 2010, the creditor wrote 
Applicant that the debt was satisfied in full. (Tr. 67-68; AE D) 
 
 In sum, Applicant paid 4 of 11 debts, and the remaining 7 debts, totaling $8,902 
are being addressed by CCC. He would have made substantially more progress, except 
he relied on a credit counseling company that was ineffective in debt resolution. 
Additionally, he had to pay about $3,200 to address his May 13, 2010 DUI. See Next 
Section.  
  
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 Applicant began consuming alcohol at the age of about 15 or 16. (Tr. 103) He 
subsequently consumed alcohol on an intermittent basis until May 13, 2010.  
 
About July 2000, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He pleaded guilty, was fined, 
and his driver’s license was suspended for six months. The court required him to attend 
a 20-hour class on drinking alcohol and driving. (Tr. 99) 
 
About November 2001, Applicant consumed four or five beers and two shots 
over a four-hour period. (GE 2 at 4) He chose to drive and was in a vehicle accident. 
(GE 2 at 4) He was arrested for DUI. He pleaded guilty and received a $1,100 fine. (Tr. 
99) The court required him to complete 40 hours of alcohol counseling. (Tr. 119) He did 
not remember whether he ever had a diagnosis or prognosis from a medical 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
professional that addressed his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 119) He has never gone to an 
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. (Tr. 119)  
  
On April 19, 2010, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he intended not to 
drink alcohol and drive. (Tr. 106) At his hearing, he said in the last three years, the only 
time he drove after consuming alcohol was on May 13, 2010. (Tr. 106-07)  
 
 On May 13, 2010, Applicant drank five or six beers over about a 90-minute 
period, and then he went for a drive. (Tr. 90) The police apprehended him for DUI. (Tr. 
83, 88-89) He told the police that he wanted to consult counsel before taking the 
breathalyzer test (BAT) at the police station. (Tr. 92, 94) There were no BAT results. He 
pleaded guilty to DUI. (Tr. 94) He is in the process of completing 20 hours of required 
alcohol-education classes. (Tr. 83) He expects the alcohol-education classes to be 
completed by the end of April 2011. (Tr. 83) He paid a $700 fine, and he paid his 
attorney $2,500. (Tr. 84) His driver’s license was suspended for six months. (Tr. 84) His 
probation was for one year, and it was completed on May 13, 2011. (Tr. 94) He noted 
his two prior DUIs (Tr. 86), and that he had quit drinking alcohol. (Tr. 90) 
 
 Applicant emphasized his patriotism, diligence and contributions to his soldier-
students. (Tr. 123) He taught them skills which may save their lives in a combat zone. 
(Tr. 123) He acknowledged that his third DUI was a big mistake, and he took full 
responsibility for his actions. (Tr. 124-25) 
 
Character references 
 
Applicant’s supervisor described Applicant as conscientious, diligent, honest, 
professional, proficient, and exceptionally effective as an instructor. (AE I) Applicant will 
be able to increase his contributions to mission accomplish if he receives a security 
clearance. (AE I) He recommended approval of Applicant’s security clearance. (AE I) 
Five student-training evaluations were very positive in their comments about the 
instruction that Applicant provided. (AE J) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations) and G (alcohol consumption).

Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his OPM personal subject interview (PSI), and his statement at his 
hearing. His SOR lists a Bankruptcy Code Chapter 7 discharge of his debts in January 
2004, and 11 delinquent debts, totaling $9,635. Some of his debts have been delinquent 
for more than two years. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG 
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;

(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants partial application of AG ¶¶ 
20(b) and 20(c), and full application of AG ¶ 20(d).3 Although Applicant did not receive 
financial counseling, he generated several budgets, and he has sufficient knowledge 
and understanding of financial and credit issues. He showed some good faith when he 
admitted responsibility for most of his SOR debts. His financial situation was damaged 
by insufficient income and brief periods of unemployment. He would have made 
substantially more progress resolving his delinquent debts, except he relied on a credit 
counseling company that was ineffective in debt resolution, and he had to pay about 
$3,200 to address his May 13, 2010 DUI. His 2010 DUI does not provide any mitigation 
under the Financial Considerations Guideline because his choice to commit the DUI 
was a voluntary act and showed very poor judgment. His financial circumstances have 
been stable for about two years.  
 
Although Applicant showed some irresponsibility by failing to maintain better 
contact with all of his creditors,4 recently, he has relied upon credit counseling services 
to resolve his delinquent debts. CCC has told Applicant not to communicate with his 
creditors. Applicant did not provide any written evidence that he disputed any debts, and 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply.  
 
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. 
June 4, 2001) (internal citation and footnote omitted)).  
 
4“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

In conclusion, Applicant paid four debts and the total of his delinquent accounts 
is less than $9,000. He has retained CCC to resolve his remaining debts. He has made 
sufficient effort and shown enough good faith to mitigate financial considerations 
concerns.  
  
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment 
or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability 
and trustworthiness.” 
   
  Seven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or 
trustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG ¶¶ 22(a) - 22(g) 
provide:   
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or 
other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is 
diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in 
an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of 
whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol 
dependent; 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol 
abuser or alcohol dependent; 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol 
dependence; 
 
(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed 
clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol 
treatment program; 
 
(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion 
of an alcohol rehabilitation program; and 
 
(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, 
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
 
AG ¶¶ 22(b) through 22(g) do not apply. Applicant did not consume alcohol at 
work or have any alcohol-related incidents at work. His alcohol-consumption problem 
was not diagnosed or evaluated by a qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) or by a licensed clinical social worker. Although he 
attended some alcohol awareness-type classes, he did not receive the benefits of a 
significant alcohol treatment program. He was not diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or as 
being alcohol dependent. Binge drinking is not defined and may require more significant 
alcohol consumption than Applicant’s. There is no evidence that Applicant failed to 
comply with a court order not to consume alcohol.  
 
From 2000 to May 13, 2010, Applicant had three alcohol-related incidents 
resulting in three DUI convictions. AG ¶ 22(a) applies. “Once a concern arises regarding 
an Applicant’s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the 
grant or maintenance of a security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. 
May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because 
the government has met its initial burden concerning alcohol consumption security 
concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating 
conditions. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
  Four Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 23(a) - 22(d) are 
potentially applicable:  
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol 
abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or 
responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); 
 
(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling 
or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, 
and is making satisfactory progress; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient 
counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as 
participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar 
organization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff 
member of a recognized alcohol treatment program. 
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant had DUIs in July 2000, 
November 2001, and on May 13, 2010. In 2000, he completed a 20-hour class on 
drinking and driving, and in 2001, he completed a similar 40-hour class. He is credited 
with completion of his third such class shortly after his hearing. He said he ended his 
alcohol consumption on May 13, 2010. Statements from colleagues, friends, or family 
 
12 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
members about his alcohol consumption would have been helpful; however, they are 
not required. He has not described attendance at any Alcoholic Anonymous meetings. 
Evidence of diagnosis and prognosis from a medical professional would have aided in 
the decision.   
 
Security clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, 
because the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show 
many different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial 
alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a 
fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.5 Of course, absence of 
alcohol consumption is not the only factor that must be considered. His history of 
alcohol problems and the lack of evidence of completion of more in-depth rehabilitation 
programs exclude providing full mitigating credit under AG ¶ 23 at this time. 
 
Applicant’s statement about ending his alcohol consumption after his May 13, 
2010 DUI is a positive development, showing that he recognizes the importance of 
overcoming his alcohol problems. However, after careful consideration of the Appeal 
Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol consumption,6 I conclude three DUIs from 2000 to 
2010, are significant factors weighing against mitigating alcohol consumption concerns.  
   
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
 
5See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 
(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   
 
6For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board 
reversed the administrative judge’s grant of a clearance and noted, “That Applicant continued to drink 
even after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge’s application of MC 3.”  In ISCR Case No. 
05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge’s grant of a 
clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB’s most 
recent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB’s case. AB had reduced his 
alcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to 
intoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB’s continued alcohol consumption was 
not responsible, and the grant of AB’s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. 
04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three 
years before hearing, and reversing administrative judge’s grant of a clearance).

for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
warrant a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. Applicant is forty years old. He is 
sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He 
graduated from high school in 1990. He has attended college; however, he has not 
earned a degree. He served in the Marine Corps from 1988 to 1990. He worked as a 
senior training instruction for his employer for two years. He deserves substantial credit 
for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor and 
during his two years of active duty Marine Corps service. Periods of unemployment 
contributed to his financial woes. He paid 4 of 11 debts, and the remaining seven debts, 
totaling $8,902 are being addressed by CCC. He would have made substantially more 
progress resolving his delinquent debts, except he relied on a credit counseling 
company that was ineffective in debt resolution. There is every indication that he is loyal 
to the United States and his employer. His supervisor praised his diligence, 
professionalism, and responsibility. I give Applicant substantial credit for admitting 
responsibility for most of his SOR debts and being honest to the OPM investigator about 
his financial plight. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and 
mitigation. 
 
The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial at this time. From 2000 to May 13, 2010, Applicant had three alcohol-
related incidents, resulting in DUI convictions. The facts, degree, and timing of his 
alcohol abuse and the extent of his rehabilitation do not establish full mitigation. With a 
history of three DUIs, a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption or 
better evidence of diagnosis, prognosis, or rehabilitation is necessary to assure that 
future lapses in judgment are unlikely. Applicant said he ended his alcohol consumption 
on May 13, 2010, which is very strong mitigation. However, his limited rehabilitative 
efforts increase security concerns. The likelihood of recurrence of alcohol consumption 
is still sufficiently probable to require more rehabilitation. Lingering doubts remain 
concerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated; however, alcohol consumption concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.l:   For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline G:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.c:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
