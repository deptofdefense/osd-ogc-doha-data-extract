GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations, but 
failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct. Eligibility for a 
security clearance and access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 22, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on April 27, 2009.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him 
another set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on May 28, 2009.3

On June 9, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and 
detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the 
Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative 
judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or 
revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on June 11, 2010. In a sworn statement, dated June 
25, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 
28, 2010, and the case was assigned to Administrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., on 
October 8, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 5, 2010, but Applicant 
failed to appear at the hearing scheduled for December 14, 2010. The case was 
reassigned to me on February 2, 2011. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 2, 
2011, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 23, 2011. 
 
 During the hearing, six Government exhibits (GE 1-6) and seven Applicant 
exhibits (AE A-G) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The 
hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on March 31, 2011. The record was kept open until 
April 6, 2011, to enable Applicant to supplement it. It also remained open until April 18, 
2011, to enable the parties to submit written closing arguments.  
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw two allegations 
because the evidence would correctly reflect that the federal tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.a.) and 
the state tax lien (SOR ¶ 1.b.) identified as being Applicant’s were, in fact, not 
Applicant’s debts. The motion was granted.4 Department Counsel also moved to 
withdraw three allegations because the evidence would show that they were actually 
duplicates of three other allegations. The motion was granted.5 Accordingly, SOR ¶ 1.o. 
was withdrawn as a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.l.; SOR ¶ 1.p. was withdrawn as a duplicate of 
SOR ¶ 1.m.; and SOR ¶ 1.q. was withdrawn as a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.n.

Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.h. and 1.i.) of the SOR. During the hearing, Applicant changed his answer pertaining 
to SOR ¶ 1.c. and admitted the allegation.6 Applicant's admissions are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. 
through 1.g., 1.j. through 1.q., and 2.a.) of the SOR. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a senior software engineer and computer system security analyst manager.7 He is 
seeking to retain a top secret security clearance. Applicant has a master’s degree in 
political science and a master’s degree in business administration.8 Over the years, 
Applicant has held several different positions with various employers. He was a security 
analyst from July 1998 until December 1999,9 and a computer systems security analyst 
manager from December 1999 until December 2006.10 He joined his current employer 
in December 2006.11 Applicant has never served with the U.S. military,12 although he 
attended U.S. Marine Corps officer candidate school for five weeks before opting out of 
further service.13 
 
Applicant was married in March 2005.14 His wife has two children, a daughter 
(born in 1985) and a son (born in 1989).15 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
In June 2002, Applicant purchased a condominium to serve as his primary 
residence.16 Because he qualified for a larger loan than he needed for the purchase, in 
January 2003, he decided to start building wealth by accumulating investment

properties.17 His credit was excellent, and banks and mortgage lenders kept soliciting 
him to finance new properties or refinance existing ones.18 His initial purchase of an 
investment property occurred in January 2003.19 Over the next two and one-half years, 
Applicant purchased other older rental properties, sold one property at a profit, and 
converted his wife’s former residence into a rental property. During that period, his 
annual income was between $100,000 and $107,000, and the banks and mortgage 
lenders performed investment analyses before issuing him mortgage loans.20  
 
Applicant’s investment properties were all rented with rents sufficient to cover the 
respective mortgage payments.21 He fixed up the properties, and they all appreciated in 
value.22 Rental traffic was good, and Applicant had lists of potential renters.23 At one 
point, because of his successes in his real estate ventures, one bank urged him to 
refinance six properties at one time, and he did so.24 Applicant continued his acquisition 
of investment properties, but did not lose sight of a contingency plan in the event of  
some future potential problems. His primary contingency plan was to keep his 
properties rented, but he believed he would be able to cover lost rents if two or three 
properties were vacant for a couple of months.25 No one predicted a devastated local 
housing market with no renters.26 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until the latter part of  
2007 when, because of the downturn in the economy, he started to lose renters in his 
investment properties. Tenants lost their jobs and were unable to pay the monthly rent, 
forcing Applicant to commence eviction proceedings.27 When the local housing market 
crashed, some renters simply relocated to better facilities with subsidies under the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher 
Program called Section 8.28 In an effort to mitigate his losses, Applicant advertised his 
properties, listed the properties with the Section 8 program, and reduced his rental

asking price.29 He continued making his mortgage payments from personal savings.30 
He even took credit card cash advances to keep making his payments.31 Properties in 
the neighborhood, including his own, started becoming vacant, and then thieves started 
stripping the vacant houses by removing air conditioners, hot water heaters, plumbing, 
etc.32  
 
To protect his interests, Applicant allowed one family to remain in one of his 
properties even though they could not pay the rent, because they served as a security 
against vandalism.33 He spoke to his realtor about the possibility of selling his 
properties, but was told there was nothing moving in the area.34 Applicant sought help 
from his mortgage lenders, advising them of the situation, but they would not offer him 
any assistance.35 Because his mortgages were linked to investment properties rather 
than a primary residence, Applicant did not qualify for any of the federal loan 
modification programs.36 At some point in September 2007, Applicant decided to stop 
using personal funds and credit cards to pay his investment property taxes, mortgages, 
and other expenses.37 He was capable of meeting his personal and family financial 
obligations, but could no longer satisfy his investment obligations.38 As a result, several 
credit card and mortgage accounts fell into arrears and became delinquent. 
 
The SOR identified 17 purportedly continuing delinquencies, as reflected by 
credit reports from 2008,39 2009,40 and 2010,41 totaling approximately $485,334, in 
charged-off, past due, tax liens, or foreclosure accounts. Some accounts reflected in the 
credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly, in many instances duplicating other 
accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. 
Some accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are identified

Applicant was issued a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt.55 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): Applicant had a credit card, which he opened to pay for business 
expenses associated with his investment properties.56 At some point, $4,419 was 
charged off.57 With the assistance of Consumer Credit Counseling Service (CCCS), 
Applicant has been making monthly payments on the account since May 2009.58 As of 
June 24, 2010, Applicant had paid $3,030.40, leaving an unpaid balance of $3,818.88.59

monthly $130 payments and indicated he would furnish written confirmation of his 
payments,63 no such documentation was ever furnished. 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.j.): When Applicant acquired his second investment property, he

(SOR ¶ 1.k.): When Applicant purchased the condominium to serve as his 
primary residence, he financed the purchase with a mortgage on the property.67 As of 
September 1, 2009, the mortgage account, with a total balance of $191,000, was past 
due in the approximate amount of $22,080.68 The mortgage lender subsequently 
foreclosed on the property.69 On December 8, 2009, the debt was cancelled by the 
mortgage lender, and Applicant was issued a Form 1099-A, Acquisition or 
Abandonment of Secured Property.70 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.l.): There is an account with a collection agency in the amount of $28 
listed as unpaid in the credit report in October 2008.71 Applicant does not recognize the 
debt and tried to contact the creditor by certified letter, using the address listed on the 
credit report, but the letter was returned to him as unclaimed.72 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.m.): There is an account in the amount of $855 listed as unpaid in the 
credit report in July 2008, and again in September 2009 with a different creditor.73 The 
account was with a telephone company. Applicant disputed the charges because he 
never went over the allotted minutes and tried to contact the creditor by certified letter 
using the address listed on the credit report, but he never received a reply.74 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.n.): There is a collection account in the amount of $7,703 listed in the 
2009 credit report.75 The unpaid balance increased to $8,363 in the 2010 credit 
report.76 Other than the first name of the collection agency, and a partial account 
number, nothing further is known about the account or the original creditor. At some 
unspecified point, the collection agency filed a complaint against Applicant in an attempt 
to enforce a contract allegedly signed by Applicant.77 Contrary to the state rules of

Personal Conduct 
 
On July 22, 2008, when Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86, he 
responded to a question set forth in the SF 86. The SOR alleges Applicant deliberately 
failed to disclose complete information in response to the following financial question: § 
28a - (In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?). 
Appellant answered “yes” to the question, and identified two delinquent credit card 
accounts.92 He did not list any of his delinquent mortgage accounts or other delinquent 
accounts which came within the scope of the question (SOR ¶¶ 1.e. through 1.h., 1.j., 
1.l., and 1.m.). However, in response to another inquiry, Applicant indicated he had “tax 
liens on investment property due to the downturn in the real estate market,” and “lien for 
taxes due on investment property.”93 In a separate section, under additional comments, 
he added:94 
 
As a real estate investor, I have experienced some financial problems due 
to the downturn in the real estate market that have affected my personal

Applicant denied intending to convey a false impression and contended he had 
“inadvertently” failed to specifically list his investment properties and essentially limited 
his response to his “personal” finances.95 It should be noted that the financial questions 
in the SF 86 do not differentiate between personal and business accounts. At the time 
he made his responses, Applicant was clearly aware that his investment property 
delinquencies were well over $100,000, but he did not consider his real estate to be 
“personal” property, even though they were all titled in his name and not as a separate 
corporate entity.96 Under those circumstances, Applicant failed to answer the question 
completely, correctly, and truthfully, and deliberately parsed words in omitting critical 
facts from his response.

the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”98   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”99 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.100  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation

There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until the latter part of 2007 
when, because of the historic downturn in the economy in general and the local housing 
market specifically, he started to lose renters in his investment properties because they 
lost their jobs and were unable to pay the monthly rent. When the local housing market 
crashed, some renters simply relocated to better facilities with subsidies under Section 
8. Applicant advertised his properties, listed the properties with the Section 8 program, 
and reduced his rental asking price. He continued making his mortgage payments from 
personal savings, and he even took credit card cash advances to keep making his 
payments. Applicant explored the possibility of selling his properties, but was told there 
was nothing moving in the area. Applicant sought help from his mortgage lenders, but 
they would not offer him any assistance. At some point in September 2007, Applicant 
decided to stop using personal funds and credit cards to pay his investment property 
taxes, mortgages, and other expenses. He was capable of meeting his personal and 
family financial obligations, but could no longer satisfy his investment obligations. As a 
result, several accounts fell into arrears and became delinquent. Four of his investment 
properties were foreclosed upon. Applicant was issued a Form 1099-A, Acquisition or 
Abandonment of Secured Property or a Form 1099-C, Cancellation of Debt, for several 
of his foreclosed properties, meaning he no longer has any financ

103 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

Applicant’s omission in his response to the one inquiry in the SF 86 of critical 
information pertaining to financial delinquencies, provides sufficient evidence to 
examine if his submission was a deliberate falsification, as alleged in the SOR, or was 
the result of an inadvertent omission or 
                                            
104 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to 
xplain the omission.  
ISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)).

evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally

As to the question pertaining to 180 day delinquencies, Applicant answered 
“yes,” and merely listed two delinquent credit cards, but only referred to his mortgage 
problems as having difficulty in renting or selling real estate. He never stated that he 
had mortgage delinquencies or foreclosures, and that was a significant omission, 
especially since the titles to the investment properties were in his name and not in the 
name of a separate corporate entity. Under those circumstances, Applicant failed to 
answer the question completely, correctly, and truthfully. His explanation is 
unreasonable and leads me to conclude that he deliberately falsified his response. AG ¶ 
16(a) has been established. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct. AG ¶ 17(a) may apply if “the individual made 
prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before 
being confronted with the facts.” Similarly, if “the offense is so minor, or so much time 
has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” AG ¶ 17(c) may apply. Also, AG ¶ 17(d) 
may apply if “the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to 
change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, 
circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate 
behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.” Applicant has steadfastly adhered to 
his brief explanation for his comments in the SF 86. None of the potentially mitigating 
conditions apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the various aspects of

There is substantial evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. In 
January 2003, he decided to start building wealth and accumulate investment 
properties. His credit was excellent, and banks and mortgage lenders kept soliciting him 
to finance new properties or refinance existing ones. He accumulated investment 
properties and was very successful in purchasing them at reasonable prices, 
rehabilitating them, and renting them. Unfortunately, because of the unexpected 
downturn in the economy and the housing market crash, he lost renters when they lost

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analy
al cases stating:106 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable pla

There are some questionable actions by Applicant in handling his delinquent 
accounts. At some point in September 2007, Applicant decided to stop using personal 
funds and credit cards to pay his investment property taxes, mortgages, and other 
expenses. He was capable of meeting his personal and family financial obligations, but 
could no longer satisfy his investment obligations. As a result, several accounts fell into 
arrears and became delinquent. Accounts were c

Also, as of April 2011, Applicant had $76,241.93 in his company 401(k), $29,208.97 in 
savings, as well as $11,745.41 in other investments, not including his investment 
properties.  Nevertheless, as it pertains to Applicant’s financial matters, I conclude that 
Applicant has established a meaningful track record. 
 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is also substantial, 
but it is primarily related to Applicant’s personal conduct in completing his SF 86. As to 
the question pertaining to 180 day delinquencies, Applicant failed to answ

undeniable that Applicant experienced severe financial problems as a result of the

notable. However, his lack of candor in explaining his fiscal problems – essentially a
