LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 23, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on January 11, 2011, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 15, 2011. 
DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 28, 2011, and the hearing was convened as 
scheduled on April 19, 2011. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which 
 
2 
 
were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) A and 
B, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open until May 27, 2011, 
for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant timely submitted documents that 
were marked AE C through O and admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s 
memorandum forwarding Applicant’s exhibits is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 27, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since October 2009. He is applying for a security clearance for the 
first time. He is single, and he has a four-year-old child.1 
  
 Applicant was a national-caliber athlete. While in his teens, he was drafted by a 
professional team and played in the minor leagues. He envisioned a career as a 
professional athlete. An injury ended his minor-league career, but he was eventually 
able to recuperate and play two seasons in college. He quit school after a different 
injury ended his college athletic career. He bounced around jobs in the entertainment 
industry for a number of years. He returned to college in 2005, and he earned 
associate’s degrees in 2006 and 2008, and a bachelor’s degree in 2007. His father has 
been in the defense industry for about 30 years, and Applicant spent much of his youth 
avoiding the path that his father took. In 2009, Applicant realized that he was not getting 
any younger and he had a child to support, and he accepted a job at the same company 
where his father is employed.2 
 
 The SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts. Applicant admitted owing all the debts 
except the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n, which he denied. Eleven of 
the debts alleged in the SOR are student loans, with balances totaling about $230,000. 
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the student loan allegations. 
 
 DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories requesting information about his delinquent 
debts. He responded on October 30, 2010. He denied owing several debts. He wrote 
that he contacted a number of creditors on October 26, 2010. He stated that he had 
“repayment plan[s] set up” for five debts, and that he was “making monthly payments of 
$100” on four private student loans. He stated that he requested forbearance on his 
federal student loans, and he submitted a letter stating that three federal student loans, 
totaling $11,205, were in forbearance. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he was 
making monthly payments of about $20 to a number of creditors for “[t]hree or four, 
maybe five months, somewhere right around there.”3 He provided documented 
evidence of his payments after the hearing. Applicant’s student loans and other 
individual debts are discussed further below.

 Applicant testified that the total amount he owes in student loans is $121,567, 
$73,667 in private loans and $47,900 in federal loans. SOR ¶¶ 1.h through 1.k allege 
four private student loans with balances totaling $73,666, so his testimony about his 
private student loans is consistent with the credit reports and the SOR.4  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g allege four federal student loans with balances totaling 
about $150,000. Those four loans are listed on the combined credit report obtained on 
May 1, 2010, and the Equifax credit report obtained on October 5, 2010. The four loans 
are also listed on the combined credit report obtained on May 26, 2010, but with some 
discrepancies. There are other federal student loans listed on all three credit reports. 
The combined credit report obtained on May 26, 2010, lists that Equifax and 
TransUnion reported the balance on one student loan as $54,118, while Experian 
reported the balance as $4,883. The credit report lists that Equifax reported the balance 
on another student loan as $5,927, while TransUnion reported it as $6,176, and 
Experian reported it as $35,978. Other loans have similar reporting problems.5  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p allege two federal student loans with balances totaling about 
$6,186. The latest credit report lists these two loans as transferred or sold and listed a 
zero balance.6  
 
 Applicant contracted with two companies to address his student loans, one for 
his federal student loans and one for his private student loans. One company wrote they 
were in the process of securing a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan on Applicant’s 
behalf to pay off his defaulted federal student loans in the amount of $47,900, which 
would “remove the defaulted status from [his] student loans and give [him] a much more 
affordable monthly payment.”7 The company handling Applicant’s private student loans 
wrote: 
 
Since these loans are private student loans, the best course of action is to 
work out a payment arrangement with [holder of loans] that will fit his 
current financial circumstances while ensuring optimal management of 
these loans. We will accomplish this by incrementally increasing payments 
as [Applicant’s] situation will allow. Our company is experienced in 
working out these types of arrangements and is in the process of doing 
so.8 
 
 On December 28, 2010, Applicant paid $20 toward the $873 delinquent student 
loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. He paid $40 on February 15, 2011, and $20 on May 16,

2011. He reported the balance as $813. This student loan is owed directly to a college 
and is separate from the loans addressed above.9 
 
 Applicant has consistently denied owing the $2,916 debt to a telephone services 
company, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. The debt is listed on the combined credit report 
obtained on May 1, 2010, and the Equifax credit report obtained on October 5, 2010, 
but it is not listed on the combined credit report obtained on May 26, 2010. Applicant 
stated that he spoke with the telephone services company, and it had no record of his 
name, account number, or Social Security number.10 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a delinquent medical debt of $807. Applicant paid $20 toward 
this debt on December 28, 2010; $40 on February 15, 2011; and $20 on May 16, 2011. 
He reported the balance as $747.11 
 
 Applicant initially denied owing the $145 and $362 medical debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.l and 1.m. The debts are not listed on the most recent credit report. He contacted 
the collection company handling the debts and was told that they verified the accounts. 
He stated that he will pay the debts now that they are verified.12  
 
 Applicant denied owing the $237 debt to a cable services company, as alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.n. He stated the debt was for a cable box that had been returned. Applicant 
decided to pay the debt, which he did on May 17, 2011.13 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.q and 1.r allege delinquent medical debts of $1,743 and $241. The 
debts are being handled by the same collection company. Applicant paid $20 to the 
collection company on December 28, 2010; $40 on February 15, 2011; and $20 on May 
16, 2011. He reported the balance as $181. Neither debt is listed on the most recent 
credit report.14 
 
 On December 28, 2010, Applicant paid $20 toward the $2,523 debt to a company 
collecting on behalf of the owner of an apartment, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.s. He paid 
another $20 on May 16, 2011. He reported the balance as $2,423. Applicant questioned 
the legitimacy of this debt, but started paying it because he felt he did not have a 
choice. He lived in an apartment that became unsafe. He received verbal permission 
from the property manager to vacate the apartment two months before the end of the 
lease. His rent was $795 per month. About four months later, he received a phone call

telling him that he owed $2,500. He never received a final accounting from the 
landlord.15 
 
 Applicant pays $200 per month, plus health insurance, as child support for his 
four-year-old child. He is current on those payments. He had a nine-year-old child, but 
he relinquished his parental rights to the child so that the child could be adopted by the 
husband of the child’s mother. He no longer has to pay current child support for that 
child, but he pays $100 per month by garnishment toward his child support arrearages. 
This debt is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.t. The October 2010 credit report listed the balance as 
$5,842.16 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.u alleges a delinquent debt of $672 to a credit union. Applicant paid $40 
toward this debt on December 28, 2010; $20 on February 15, 2011; and $20 on May 16, 
2011. He reported the balance as $592.17 
   
 In summary, in addition to his child support arrearages that are paid by 
garnishment, Applicant established debt payments of $120 on December 28, 2010; 
$140 on February 15, 2011; $100 on May 16, 2011; and $237 on May 17, 2011; for a 
total amount paid of $597. Applicant will work overseas if he obtains a security 
clearance. His salary will greatly increase while overseas. He believes he can pay all his 
non-student loan debts and a large percentage of his student loans with his overseas 
pay. He has cut down or eliminated some expenses in order to pay his debts. He 
stopped driving to work and either rides a bike or rides with someone, which saves 
commuting and auto expenses. He recently moved in with his girlfriend, and he stated 
that he will apply the $350 per month he will save from the move toward his debts. His 
girlfriend holds a security clearance. She stated that she would do anything she could to 
help him, including “sitting down and going through [his] finances with him.” Applicant 
has received financial counseling.18  
 
 Applicant submitted a letter from his employer stating that he is a “top-notch 
employee,” who takes pride in his work.19 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
                                                          
15 Tr. at 42, 57-62; AE H. 
 
16 Tr. at 33-39; GE 1-4. 
 
17 Tr. at 61; AE I. 
 
18 Tr. at 21-27, 30-32, 40-42, 50-51, 63, 67-68; AE C, D 
 
19 AE L. 
 
6 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
 
7 
 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to pay his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above 
disqualifying conditions. 
 
Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems cannot be attributed to conditions that were 
outside his control. AG ¶ 20(b) is not applicable.  
 
 Applicant received financial counseling and retained two companies to assist 
him with his student loans. The first part of AG ¶ 20(c) is applicable.  
 
 Applicant disputed owing several debts. AG ¶ 20(e) is applicable to the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and the student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p. Applicant 
 
8 
 
stated that he owed $47,900 in delinquent federal student loans, which is also the 
number quoted by the company that is helping him with his defaulted federal student 
loans. There are problems with how his federal student loans are reported by the credit 
agencies. I find AG ¶ 20(e) applicable to Applicant’s federal student loans in excess of 
$47,900, which I will identify as SOR ¶¶ 1.e through and 1.g. 
 
 When he responded to interrogatories in October 2010, Applicant stated that he 
had “repayment plan[s] set up” for five debts, and that he was “making monthly 
payments of $100” on four private student loans. In addition to his child support 
arrearages that are paid by garnishment, Applicant established debt payments of $120 
on December 28, 2010; $140 on February 15, 2011; $100 on May 16, 2011; and $237 
on May 17, 2011; for a total amount paid of $597. I find that those payments are 
insufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort to pay his debts. AG ¶ 20(d) is not applicable.  
 
 Applicant is in the process of addressing his student loans, but he has not made 
any payments. He recently cut expenses, so that he can apply the savings toward his 
debts. Applicant stated that if he receives a security clearance, he will work overseas, 
and he will pay all his non-student loan debts and a large percentage of his student 
loans with his overseas pay. 
 
 A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a 
procedure designed to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as 
a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant 
need only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions 
to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the 
SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 Applicant appears to be sincere in his desire to address his financial problems. 
What is missing here is a track record of financial responsibility, in other words, 
significant actions to implement his plan. I find that Applicant’s finances are not yet 
under control. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. I am unable to determine 
that they are unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and the second part of AG ¶ 20(c) are 
not applicable. I find that financial concerns remain despite the presence of some 
mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
 
9 
 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
I considered Applicant’s favorable reputation at his company. Applicant has 
made minimal payments toward his delinquent debts. His real plan is to obtain a 
security clearance, and then pay his debts with his overseas pay. If he can establish a 
track record of financial responsibility, he should be given that opportunity. While I 
believe that Applicant can arrive at that position, he is not there yet. Under AG ¶ 2(b), I 
am required to resolve my doubt in favor of national security. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b-1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e-1.g:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.h-1.m:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.n-1.p:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.q-1.u:  Against Applicant 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
