MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant overextended himself on consumer credit cards to pay for necessities, but 
also for discretionary items such as a family cruise, swimming pool supplies and repairs, 
and sporting events. As of September 2010, he owed about $87,896 in delinquent debt. He 
retained an attorney in January 2011 to help him resolve his financial issues, but it is too 
soon to conclude that his financial problems are behind him. Clearance denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On September 10, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations, which provided the basis for its preliminary decision 
to deny him a security clearance and to refer the matter to an administrative judge. DOHA 
took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department 
of Defense on September 1, 2006.

Applicant submitted an undated response to the SOR and requested a hearing. On 
January 6, 2011, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing and to determine 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him. I scheduled a hearing for January 26, 2011. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Eight Government exhibits (Ex. 1-8) and four 
Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-D) were admitted without objection. Applicant also testified, as 
reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 4, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that Applicant owed 
delinquent debt totaling $87,896 to nine consumer credit lenders or their assignees as of 
September 2010 (SOR 1.a-1.i). Applicant admitted the alleged debts. His admissions are 
incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I 
make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old senior designer who started with his current employer, a 
defense contractor, in January 1980. After 13 years on the job, he was laid off in October 
1993. Applicant worked as a senior mechanical designer for another company from July 
1994 until October 2000, when he returned to work for his current employer. On June 7, 
2004, Applicant applied for his first security clearance. (Ex. 1, 2.) All his financial accounts 
were in good standing (Ex. 8), and a secret-level security clearance was granted him in 
May 2005. (Ex. 1; Tr. 33.) He is required to maintain a secret clearance for his duties. (Ex. 
C.) 
 
Applicant and his spouse have been married for 27 years. They have two sons, who 
are now 16 and 21. (Ex. 1, 2; Tr. 31.) He owns his home, which was purchased around 
June 1985. (Ex. 1.) He has refinanced the mortgage on the home several times since then. 
In July 2001, he paid off his $128,000 mortgage loan by taking on a new loan of $168,750. 
In September 2002, he refinanced with a $225,000 loan. He has had his present mortgage 
since 2003, when he took out a $230,000 loan. In July 2006, he took on a second 
mortgage of $100,000 (Ex. 7.), which he used to pay household expenses such as school 
tuition. (Tr. 71.) As of November 2010, he owed about $203,000 on his primary mortgage 
and $88,000 on his second mortgage. (Ex. 4.) His monthly payments totaled $2,403 (Ex. 
5), and he was current in his payments. (Ex. 4.) 
 
Over the past 20 years (Ex. 8.), Applicant relied heavily on consumer credit to pay 
for day-to-day necessities, such as groceries for the family, gasoline for his vehicle, car 
repairs (e.g., $1,000 for a transmission), and clothing. He used credit to pay for braces for 
his sons at $3,500 apiece, and he spent $1,200 on the purchase and then repair of a 
computer. Applicant also used credit cards to pay for plumbing and other work required in 
conjunction with an $85,000 to $90,000 addition to the family home in 2002
1
 (Tr. 35.), and 
                                                 
1 
Applicant financed the home construction through a home equity loan and he also borrowed funds from 
his in-laws. (Tr. 35.) 
 
 
 3 
to pay for other home improvements (e.g., $1,000 for a fence, $1,000 for a new roof on the 
garage). He had a swimming pool installed on his property in 1998 at a cost of around 
$5,000 with supplies. (Ex. A; Tr. 64.) Applicant also relied on consumer credit (convenience 
checks) to cover part of the $100,000 to $150,000 in estimated private school tuition and 
hockey programs and equipment for both sons.
2
 (Tr. 35-36, 43-44.) In October 2007, the 
family took a cruise costing around $4,500 that Applicant paid for by credit. One son took a 
school trip to Italy at a cost of $2,300. Applicant bought a dog on credit, and with veterinary 
bills, incurred another $1,500 in debt. He bought two new beds for his sons at $1,500. 
Entertainment expenses (eating out, video games, sporting equipment and tickets to 
events) were often charged to credit accounts. Applicant planned on paying off his high 
consumer credit balances with the equity in his home and with his 401(k) assets. (Ex. A.) 
 
Around late 2007, Applicant lost the opportunity to work overtime. Depending on the 
hours worked, he had earned up to $1,200 to $1,500 in extra pay a month. (Tr. 37.) He 
exhausted his 401(k) assets of $20,000 in an effort to maintain his good credit. (Ex. A; Tr. 
42.) Even with his spouse‟s income, Applicant could no longer afford to make the monthly 
minimum payments. Applicant considered taking on a part-time job, but he hoped overtime 
would resume. (Tr. 38.) He also contacted an attorney, who informed him that there was no 
law that forced him to address his debts absent a summons. (Tr. 45.) Based on this advice, 
Applicant stopped making payments on several accounts, as reflected in the following 
table.

 At times, Applicant used convenience checks from credit card lenders to make his 
credit card payments. (Tr. 69.) When he could no longer meet the monthly minimum 
payments on his credit cards, Applicant sought the assistance of a debt management 
company. (Tr. 29-30.) On October 2, 2008, he was presented a plan to resolve the debts 
identified in the SOR together with another debt of $3,019 not alleged in the SOR. Under 
the debt management plan, Applicant was to pay $1,626 per month to the company to 
resolve past-due credit card debt totaling $77,679 by September 2013. Applicant could not 
afford the monthly payment because his spouse also had debt that she was repaying, so 
 
 5 
he did not pursue it further. (Tr. 30, 43.) Nor did he make any effort to contact his creditors 
directly. (Ex. 3.) 
 
On December 16, 2009, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to update his security clearance. In response to the 
financial record inquiries, he answered “Yes” only to question 26.g, “Have you had any bills 
or debts turned over to a collection agency?” However, he listed the debts in the SOR 
(SOR 1.h under the name of the furniture retailer) and indicated “all debts are 90-180 days 
overdue, i.e. questions h, m & n.” (Ex. 1.) His credit was checked on December 25, 2009, 
and the indebtedness was confirmed. (Ex. 7.) 
 
Applicant apparently expressed his willingness to resolve his delinquent debts 
during a January 29, 2010, interview with an authorized investigator for the Department of 
Defense.
3
 Around June 2010, DOHA asked Applicant to provide documentary proof of any 
efforts by him to resolve his indebtedness and to complete a personal financial statement.  
On June 25, 2009, Applicant informed DOHA that he had made no payments. He attributed 
his credit card problems to a rise in the interest rates on his accounts, to loss of his 
overtime, and the lack of home equity. He indicated that he did not have the money 
available to pay the debts, but he planned to work on resolving them in the near future. 
Applicant‟s average monthly expenses exceeded his and his spouse‟s joint net income by 
about $1,000. (Ex. 3.) 
 
From July 2010 to December 2010, overtime was again available at work, and 
Applicant averaged an extra 10 hours a week at $60 an hour. (Tr. 39-40.) He used some of 
this extra money to repay a loan from his father-in-law for his son‟s high school tuition. (Tr. 
56.) Around January 25, 2011, he retained the attorney who had advised him back in 2008 
to stop making payments on his credit cards. Applicant paid $1,500 of the retainer fee and 
owes another $900. (Tr. 57.) This attorney may negotiate with Applicant‟s creditors (Ex. B; 
Tr. 28.), although Applicant is also considering bankruptcy. (Tr. 47.) Applicant has made no 
payments on any of his debts “because it‟s just too much, too much money to—there‟s too 
many of them.” (Tr. 46.) 
 
Applicant no longer uses any personal credit cards. (Tr. 56-57.) He has about $300 
in his checking account and nothing in savings. (Tr. 57.) As of June 2010, he was spending 
about $200 per month eating out and $250 per month on gifts. (Ex. 3.) As of January 2011, 
he had reduced his restaurant and gift expenses, but he was still eating “a lot of fast food 
stuff” and averaging “$200 or less” per month on gifts. (Tr. 52-54.) Applicant pays about 
$160 per month for four cell phones. (Ex. 3.) 
 
Applicant earns about $82,000 annually from his full-time job with the defense 
contractor. Because he is in a union, he receives a raise each year set at 1.5% of his 
salary. For the past three years, Applicant‟s spouse has been employed in the biomedical 
industry earning between $62,000 and $63,000 a year. (Tr. 33.) She retired in 2005 after 
25 years with an airline, although she is not presently collecting a pension. Applicant‟s 
                                                 
3 
DOHA referenced the subject interview in its interrogatories (see Ex. 3). The report of the interview was not 
available for my review.  
 
 6 
spouse worked as a stenographer for six months, but she was otherwise unemployed 
before starting her present job around 2006. (Tr. 34, 69.) As of January 2011, Applicant 
was managing to pay his mortgages on time, despite expenses that appeared to exceed 
the household income. (Tr. 50-55.) On occasion, he falls behind on his cable television and 
water bills. (Tr. 56.) Applicant‟s spouse is paying $1,300 per month on her own debt. She 
owes primarily loans, but she is also paying $450 per month to a debt management 
program. (Tr. 67, 76.) 
 
 As of January 2011, his younger son was still attending private high school, at a 
tuition cost of $600 per month. (Tr. 43, 60.) Applicant‟s older son was living at home and 
working part-time. (Tr. 31-32.)  
 
Applicant has not allowed his personal financial problems to negatively affect his 
work for the defense contractor. Applicant currently supports a program activity that has 
required him to handle and control sensitive data. The program‟s technical leader has 
observed Applicant‟s work performance for the past four years. He has no concerns about 
Applicant‟s personal integrity or his ability to safeguard sensitive information. He considers 
Applicant to be a valuable contributor and is of the opinion that Applicant‟s removal from 
the program would be a “major set-back” to the program activity and the Government 
agency that they serve. (Ex. C.) The company‟s regional security manager has had a 
professional relationship with Applicant since 2006. He has confidence in Applicant‟s 
continuing ability to protect classified information “while he is working out his personal 
finances.” (Ex. D.) 
 
Policies 
 
 The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing 
that “no one has a „right‟ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant‟s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge‟s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
 The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence of 
record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
 
 7 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the Applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The Applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
  
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 
10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, 
Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern about finances is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one‟s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
Applicant failed to adequately monitor his or his spouse‟s spending, and he took 
advantage of several credit card offers extended to him. He used convenience checks on 
his credit cards to pay for private school tuition for his sons, but also to pay other credit 
card accounts. He took out home equity loans to cover some expenses. By October 2008, 
he could no longer make the monthly minimums on about $77,679 in accrued credit card 
debt. AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of 
not meeting financial obligations,” are implicated. AG ¶ 19(b), “indebtedness caused by 
frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent 
to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt,” aptly describes his financial 
behavior. Moreover, AG ¶ 19(e), “consistent spending beyond one‟s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt to income 
ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” also applies. As of June 2010, he was operating at a 
monthly deficit around $1,000, which did not include any payments on his delinquent credit 
card accounts. He was still struggling to meet his financial obligations as January 2011, as 
evidenced by late payments at times on his cable and water bills. 
 
 
 8 
None of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 apply. Applicant‟s financial 
problems are ongoing, as shown by his negative cash flow and inability to make payments 
on his past-due credit card debts. AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual‟s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” is not 
pertinent. AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person‟s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” also does not apply. While the loss of overtime around late 2007 
was unexpected, his financial problems are largely due to overspending, including for 
discretionary vacations, hockey camps for his sons, and entertainment. Certainly it is 
understandable that Applicant would want the best education for his sons, but it is difficult 
to justify the continuing expenditure of $600 per month in private school tuition for his 
younger son when he has an outstanding financial judgment around $11,000 against him. 
Applicant has failed to handle his personal finances responsibly. 
 
AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” 
also does not apply. Applicant just retained an attorney to address these debts through 
some negotiated settlements or even a bankruptcy. As of the close of the record, he had 
no plan in place to resolve his delinquencies, even with respect to repaying the recent 
judgment. Furthermore, while he was no longer using any credit cards, he had not shown 
that he had reduced his expenses to the point where I can conclude that his spending is 
under control. Applicant is credited with having looked into repaying his debts through a 
debt management plan around October 2008, when he realized that he could no longer 
afford the monthly minimum payments on his credit cards. But AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” is not 
implicated because he has made no payments on any of his past-due accounts. Overtime 
earnings between July 2010 and December 2010 went to repay his father in-law, who 
covered the costs of school tuition for Applicant‟s younger son. 
 
As of January 2011, Applicant had no savings and only $300 in checking account 
funds. He had yet to pay $900 of his attorney‟s retainer fee. It does not appear that he has 
the financial assets to resolve his delinquent debt in the near future. The Financial 
Considerations concerns are not mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant‟s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct and 
all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(a).
4
 Applicant‟s financial problems are of his own making. As the years went by, he 
                                                 
4
The adjudicative process requires assessment of the following factors: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual‟s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
 
 9 
continued to take advantage of credit card offers, including convenience checks which he 
at times deposited into his checking account when he did not have the funds to pay for 
school tuition, vacations, even hockey bills. He operated “with the illusion that [he] would 
have the ability to pay [his debts] off down the road with equity in the house, the stock 
market, proceeds of whatever.” (Tr. 36.) By October 2008, he was so financially 
overextended that he could no longer make the monthly minimum payments on his credit 
card accounts. 
 
Applicant has not allowed his poor financial judgment to extend into the workplace, 
where he has been a valuable contributor and has handled sensitive information 
appropriately. Also in Applicant‟s favor, he has been candid about his financial problems 
from the start. He disclosed his debts on his e-QIP and even admitted at his hearing that 
the creditor identified in SOR 1.b recently obtained a judgment against him. But neither his 
work record nor his candor are sufficient to overcome the financial concerns. He has yet to 
demonstrate that he can live within his means, and he remains under a substantial 
financial burden that is not likely to be resolved in the near future. Based on the facts 
before me, I cannot conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue Applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a-1.i: Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
