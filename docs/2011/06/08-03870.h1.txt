FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on April 13, 2007. On 
December 22, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his 
application, citing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. DOHA acted under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of 
Defense on September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 4, 2011; answered it on January 25, 
2011; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the 
 
2 
 
 
request on January 27, 2011. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February 
25, 2011, and the case was assigned to me on March 4, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of 
hearing on March 17, 2011, scheduling it for April 6, 2011. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 14 were admitted without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were 
admitted without objection. I kept the record open until April 22, 2011, to enable 
Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX F through 
I, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding 
AX F through I are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) on April 13, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.e-1.i, and 1.o. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.j-1.n, 1.p-1.s, and 2.a. 
His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of defense contractor. He served in the U.S. 
Navy from June 1980 to June 2003 and retired as a chief petty officer. He has worked 
continuously for defense contractors since his retirement. He is a high school graduate 
and has completed about three years of college, working toward a bachelor’s degree in 
organizational management. (Tr. 49-50.) He received a security clearance early in his 
Navy career and has held a clearance continuously until the present. 
 
 Applicant married in June 1989. He and his wife have a daughter who is in 
college. Applicant paid her college expenses of about $2,400 per month for two years. 
She now has a scholarship, and Applicant pays about $500 per month for her room and 
board. (Tr. 49.)  
 
 Applicant and his wife were both employed while he was in the Navy. Relying on 
two incomes, they purchased a home, an automobile, and furniture for their home. Even 
with two incomes, they were “house poor.” (Tr. 54.) Applicant’s wife became ill, was 
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and became unable to work. Her income had 
accounted for about 38% of the family income, and they fell behind on their financial 
obligations. (Tr. 37-38.)  
 
Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 petition for bankruptcy in May 1996, and 
they completed the payment plan in November 2000. (GX 5 at 67; GX 7 at 2; Answer to 
SOR.) This bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
 
 When Applicant completed his first Chapter 13 bankruptcy, he still owned his 
home, and he was obligated to pay his first and second mortgages. (Tr. 56.) He filed a 
second Chapter 13 petition for bankruptcy in March 2006, after he fell behind on his 
home mortgage payments and the lender took steps to foreclose on the property. (GX 
5; GX 6; GX 8 at 4.) This bankruptcy was dismissed in May 2008 for failure to make the 
required payments. (GX 5 at 77-78.) This bankruptcy was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. 
 
3 
 
 
Applicant presented evidence that medical problems cause about 62% of bankruptcies, 
and that it can take 10 to 20 years to recover from a bankruptcy. (AX A; AX B.) 
 
 The SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant willfully failed to file federal tax returns for 
tax years 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006. Applicant submitted IRS account 
transcripts for tax years 1999 through 2005, showing that he filed his 1999 and 2005 
returns in 2006, and that the IRS prepared substitute returns for 2000, 2002, and 2003. 
(GX 4 at Enclosure 2.)  
 
 A summary of an interview with a security investigator in June 2007 reflects that 
Applicant told the investigator that he had filed his federal and state taxes every year 
and did not owe any penalties or taxes. In response to DOHA interrogatories asking him 
to verify the accuracy of the investigator’s interview summary, Applicant submitted 
numerous additions and corrections but did not dispute the accuracy of the summary 
regarding his state and federal tax returns. (GX 4, Enclosure 2.) At the hearing, he 
denied saying that he filed his returns “every year.” He testified he intended to say that 
all his tax returns had been filed as of the date of the interview. (Tr. 98-99.) 
 
In March 2010, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories by submitting 
copies of federal tax returns for 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2006 through 2009. None of 
those copies are signed, dated, or bear indicia of mailing or receipt. (GX 4 at Document 
(5).) Applicant contends that he owed $724 for 2000, owed $143 for 2007, and owed 
$1,110 for 2009; and he was entitled to refunds of $593 for 2001, $1,558 for 2002, 
$1,971 for 2003, $2,188 for 2006, and $2,901 for 2008. These computations, if 
accurate, would produce a net refund rather than an unpaid tax debt, but they do not 
include any penalties or interest. In May 2011, he negotiated a payment plan of $100 
per month while the amount of delinquent taxes, if any, is being computed. (AX G.)  
 
 The SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant failed to file state tax returns for 2003, 2004, 
and 2005. He admitted this allegation, explaining that he was a legal resident of a state 
that has no state income tax until he retired from the Navy in June 2003. After he moved 
to another state that has an income tax, he did not timely file his returns. He testified 
that he had filed all his state tax returns, but he submitted no documentary evidence of 
filing.  
 
 Applicant testified that he is “chronically late” in filing his tax returns. When he 
knows he owes money, he tends to delay filing until he can accumulate what he owes. 
He admitted deliberately filing his federal income tax returns late, but he denied that he 
intended to not file his tax returns. (Tr. 61-62.) 
 
 Shortly before the hearing, Applicant received a settlement offer on the 
repossession deficiency alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, and he negotiated a payment agreement 
for the repossession deficiency alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. However, he had not made any 
payments on either debt as of the date the record closed. (AX H; AX I; Tr. 66-68.) 
 
 
4 
 
 
 Applicant was unsure when he purchased the foreclosed time-share property 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k, but he “assumed” that it was before his bankruptcy in 2006. (Tr. 
76-77.) His December 2004 credit report reflects that his account with the lender was 
opened in February 2003 and the last activity was in April 2003. (GX 7 at 3.)

 In October 2009, Applicant and his wife were able to sell their home and pay off 
their first and second mortgages. (GX 4, Documents at (3).) They now live in a rental 
home. Their landlord submitted a statement that Applicant and his wife have been “ideal 
tenants” and have paid their rent on time since they began their tenancy in August 
2009. (AX D.) 
 
 Applicant was required by the bankruptcy court to complete online financial 
counseling, and he recalled taking a financial counseling course while on active duty. 
(Tr. 99-100.) There is no evidence of any recent financial counseling. 
  
 In May 2010, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement. It reflects gross 
household income of $9,715 per month, taxes of $1,597, deductions of $906, and 
expenses of $6,370, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $842. (GX 3 at 9.) In 
April 2011, Applicant accepted an employment offer from a defense contractor at an 
annual gross pay of $134,000, which will increase his monthly gross pay by about 
$1,451 per month. (AX E.) In June 2010, Applicant submitted additional information 
reflecting that he would no longer be paying his daughter’s college tuition after August 
2010, thereby reducing his monthly expenses by about $1,900 per month. (GX 2.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
 
6 
 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
 The SOR alleges two Chapter 13 bankruptcies (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b), failure to 
file federal and state tax returns as required (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e), and 15 delinquent 
debts, including a federal tax debt of about $8,106 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f-1.s). Applicant 
admitted the bankruptcies and filing his tax returns late. His credit reports and other 
documentary evidence show that the federal tax debt and several other debts are 
unresolved. 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 
7 
 
 
Applicant’s financial history raises four disqualifying conditions under this 
guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(g): failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.  
 
 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This mitigating 
condition is not established, because Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous and 
ongoing, and they did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
The illness of Applicant’s wife was an unusual event, but it is ongoing and likely to 
continue. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established. The illness and incapacity of 
Applicant’s wife was a condition beyond their control, but they were living on the 
financial edge when she became ill, and Applicant has not acted responsibly. He 
neglected to file his federal tax returns even though he believed he was entitled to 
refunds for several years. He and his wife purchased a time-share property even though 
they were living on a tight budget. He did not address his financial problems until he 
realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). Applicant 
received mandatory counseling in connection with his bankruptcies and attended 
financial management classes while he was on active duty in the Navy, but the second 
prong of this mitigating condition is not established, because Applicant’s financial 
situation is not yet under control. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
 
8 
 
 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of 
law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only 
establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement 
the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be 
paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Evidence of 
past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of 
qualifying for a security clearance.   
 
In May 2011, Applicant made a payment agreement for his federal taxes, and he 
has been making $100 payments per month while the amount of his indebtedness, if 
any, is determined. He negotiated agreements to settle the two car repossession 
deficiencies alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h, but he had made no payments as of the 
date the record closed. He testified he had resolved his state tax problem, but he 
submitted no documentation to corroborate his testimony. He claimed that the time-
share foreclosure alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k was resolved by sale of the property, but he 
provided no documentation that the debt is fully resolved. He is attempting to resolve 
the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.p and related insurance issues. The remaining debts 
alleged in the SOR are unresolved. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is established for SOR 
¶¶ 1.c and 1.p, but not for the remaining debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). Applicant 
denied the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1.n, and 1.q-1.s, but he did not document the 
basis of the disputes or provide evidence of actions to resolve them. I conclude AG ¶ 
20(e) is not established. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
 The SOR alleges that in June 2007 Applicant falsified material facts in an 
interview with a security investigator by claiming that he had filed federal and state tax 
returns every year and denying that he owed any unpaid taxes or penalties. The 
security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   
 
9 
 
 
The relevant disqualifying condition is AG ¶ 16(b): “deliberately providing false or 
misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security 
official, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.” When 
a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden 
of proving it. An omission or misstatement, standing alone, does not prove falsification. 
An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an 
applicant’s state of mind at the time of the omission or misstatement. See ISCR Case 
No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  
 Applicant had an opportunity to review the personal interview summary, which 
recites that he “advised that he had filed his federal and state taxes every year and he 
does not owe any back penalty taxes or unpaid taxes,” and he did not object to the 
accuracy of this recital in his response to DOHA interrogatories. However, I am not 
satisfied that he understood the subtlety or significance of the language of the interview 
summary. The IRS records reflect that he filed his overdue federal returns before the 
interview. He had spent most of his adult life as a legal resident of a state that does not 
have a state income tax. He did not realize that he was required to file state tax returns 
in his new legal residence after he retired from the Navy. His copies of his federal tax 
returns indicated that he did not owe any federal taxes, and the amount of his tax 
liability, if any, is still undetermined. I conclude that deliberate falsification is not 
established by substantial evidence. Accordingly, I resolve SOR ¶ 2.a in Applicant’s 
favor.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors 
in AG ¶ 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional 
comment. 
 
 
10 
 
 
 Applicant is a mature, well-educated adult, but he is financially unsophisticated. 
He has been living on the financial edge for many years, and he has made some 
unwise decisions, such as purchasing a time-share vacation property while living on a 
tight budget. He is a self-admitted financial procrastinator. He has not maintained good 
records of his financial decisions. He was candid and sincere at the hearing, and his 
demeanor was a factor in my determination that he did not intentionally falsify material 
facts during his security interview. On the other hand, his track record of financial 
mismanagement and procrastination leaves me with doubts about his reliability and 
good judgment. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and 
E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has refuted the allegations of falsification, but he has not mitigated the 
security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not 
carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue his eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.d-1.o:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.p:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.q-1.s:    Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.
