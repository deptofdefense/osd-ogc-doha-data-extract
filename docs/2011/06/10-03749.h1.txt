LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations and personal conduct 
security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 16, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on February 10, 2011, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. On February 24, 2011, DOHA amended the SOR 
adding an additional allegation under Guideline F and two allegations under Guideline 
E, personal conduct. The case was assigned to me on March 18, 2011. DOHA issued a 
 
2 
 
notice of hearing on March 28, 2011, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on 
April 19, 2011. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 27, 2011. 
 
Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings 
 
Notice 
 
Applicant affirmatively waived his right under ¶ E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days 
notice before the hearing. 
 
Evidence 
 
The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were received without 
objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits (AE) 1.a through 1.q, and 2 through 
10, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open until May 27, 
2011, for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant’s request for additional 
time to submit evidence was granted. Applicant submitted documents that were marked 
AE 11 through 18 and admitted without objection. The e-mail correspondence about the 
post-hearing evidence is marked Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through III.  
 
Motion to Amend SOR 
 
On my own motion and without objection, I amended the SOR by adding an 
additional allegation under Guideline E, as follows: 
 
2.c. You intentionally provided false information on your questionnaire for 
national security positions, dated September 18, 2009, when you stated 
that you left employment at the county hospital in [location] because you 
“resigned due to conflict with management,” when, in fact, you had been 
terminated from that position. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is applying for a 
security clearance. He served on active duty in the United States military from 1996 until 
he was honorably discharged in 2000. He attended college for a period but did not earn 
a degree. He has never been married and has no children.1 
 
 Applicant has been interested in computers and information technology (IT) since 
before he joined the military. He owned several computers and had multiple systems 
and computer equipment. After he was discharged from the military, he obtained a job 
as a government employee on the military facility where he was stationed before his 
discharge. He worked throughout the facility in IT and network support. He was 
responsible for 38 buildings and worked with numerous pieces of computer equipment.2

 In 2003, Applicant was offered a good job with a substantial salary at a county 
hospital in another geographic location. He had a short period to accept the job, resign 
from his government position, and move to the new location. In September 2003, he 
rented a truck and moved his household goods. He placed his goods in storage for 
several weeks at his new location until he found a place to live. When he moved to the 
new location, he took several pieces of computer equipment that belonged to the U.S. 
Government.3  
 
 Applicant’s girlfriend at the time moved with him to the new geographic location. 
They started having problems. On December 5, 2003, she contacted military 
investigators at the local military facility and reported that Applicant stole three computer 
systems from his old facility. She consented to a search of their residence. Applicant 
had numerous pieces of computer equipment in a room. The investigators seized the 
equipment, much of which could not be identified as government property. However, 
two computer central processing units (CPU) and three monitors were identified as 
government property.4  
 
 Applicant was interviewed over the telephone by a military investigator in April 
2005. The investigator told Applicant that computer equipment was missing from the 
facility where Applicant used to work. Applicant told the investigator that he knew 
nothing about missing computers, and that he had not been employed at the facility 
since 2003. The investigator referenced the computer equipment found at the ex-
girlfriend’s home. Applicant stated that he knew nothing about what was in her home or 
about any computer equipment.5 
 
 Applicant admitted at the hearing that several of the items seized were 
government property. He denied stealing any of the items. He stated they were 
accidently shipped when he moved to the new location. He stated he discovered the 
items in about October 2003, when he unpacked the shipment. He stated he called his 
old supervisor and told him that he had the equipment and would return it. Applicant 
stated he planned to return the equipment, but because of a busy schedule, he did not 
get around to it before the items were seized. The supervisor was interviewed as part of 
the investigation. He did not mention a phone call from Applicant. Applicant was never 
charged with anything related to the stolen computer equipment.6 I did not find 
Applicant’s testimony credible. I find that he stole computer equipment from the military 
facility. 
 
 Applicant ex-girlfriend also told the military investigators that Applicant was 
physically abusive, and she was afraid he would harm her if he found out about her 
cooperation with the investigation. The investigator convinced her to report Applicant to

the local police. Applicant was arrested on December 5, 2003, and charged with assault 
causing bodily injury against a family member and terroristic threat. A protective order 
was also issued. The ex-girlfriend alleged that Applicant pointed a handgun at her and 
stated that if she said anything about what happened there or about the computers, he 
would kill her. Applicant permitted the arresting officers to search his vehicle for a 
handgun. A .25 caliber semiautomatic pistol with a clip and a leather case was 
discovered in his vehicle. Applicant testified that he never owned or had a handgun. He 
stated that he did not know how the handgun got in his vehicle, but he speculated that 
his ex-girlfriend may have planted it.7  
 
 Applicant was arrested on December 18, 2003, and charged with violating the 
protective order. He pleaded guilty under a deferred adjudication to violating the 
protective order, and the assault and terroristic threat charges were dismissed. He was 
sentenced to probation for one year, a fine, and court costs.8   
 
 Applicant was terminated by his hospital employer in December 2003. He 
testified that his ex-girlfriend called the hospital, told them he had been arrested, and 
sent them copies of the police reports.9 He was unemployed for several months before 
he was able to obtain a job at a lesser salary than he earned before the hospital ended 
his employment. He was unable to pay all his bills on his reduced salary, and a number 
of debts became delinquent.10    
 
 The SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling about $37,000. Except as 
specifically stated below, the allegations were established through credit reports and 
Applicant’s admissions. The delinquent debts raising security concerns in Applicant’s 
case are addressed in the table below.

In summary, Applicant paid or settled 11 debts, he successfully disputed 4 debts, and 
he has payments plans in effect for 2 debts. 
 
 Applicant’s stepfather cosigned a student loan with Applicant. His stepfather 
declared bankruptcy. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges this debt with a balance of $11,269. On April 
 
6 
 
13, 2011, Applicant and the collection company entered an agreement to settle the 
balance of $17,046 with payments of $3,000 on April 26, 2011, and $7,492 on May 24, 
2011. Applicant testified that he would have no problems making the two payments. On 
April 29, 2011, Applicant and the collection company entered a new agreement to settle 
the balance of $17,548 for $11,268, with a payment of $1,500 on April 29, 2011, 
followed by monthly payments of $1,628. Applicant paid $750 on May 2, 2011, and 
another $750 on May 9, 2011.11  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a $12,372 delinquent debt to a financial institution for the 
deficiency owed on a car loan after the car was repossessed. In March 2011, Applicant 
agreed to a stipulated judgment with the creditor to pay $650 per month until the debt 
was paid. He agreed to pay $14,176, plus $893 court costs, and $500 attorney’s fees. 
Interest would accrue at 21.99% until paid. The first payment was due March 1, 2011. 
Applicant made four $650 payments between March and June 2011.12 
 
 In February 2010, Applicant asked a coworker to be his financial manager. Her 
responsibilities included “paying his bills in a timely manner, working with a financial 
advisor to monitor the progress of his investments into his mutual funds . . . , preparing 
his annual tax returns as well as monitoring and repairing his credit.” On March 2010, 
Applicant contracted with a credit consulting company to assist him with his credit report 
and provide financial counseling. Applicant’s current job pays a high salary. He earns 
enough to pay his current debts and continue with the payments toward his delinquent 
debts.13   
 
 Applicant submitted a questionnaire for national security positions (SF 86) in 
September 2009. Under the employment section, he listed that his employment at the 
hospital ended in December 2003, because he “[r]esigned due to conflict with 
management.” Applicant admitted that was a false answer. He stated the “job that [he] 
was working at was a [military] contract and [he] didn’t really want to bring that to light 
as far as what was going on.” Applicant submitted a copy of his resume as an exhibit. 
The resume reports that he worked for the military until December 2003, and it does not 
list his employment for the county hospital.14 I find that Applicant intentionally falsified 
the SF 86 when he wrote that he resigned from the hospital. 
 
 Applicant submitted character letters attesting to his excellent job performance, 
leadership, work ethic, professionalism, trustworthiness, and reliability.15

be used for disqualification purposes. It will be used in assessing Applicant’s credibility, in the application 
of mitigating conditions, and in analyzing the “whole person.”

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single 
guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-
person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not 
properly safeguard protected information; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as 
. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person’s 
personal, professional, or community standing.  
 
Applicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 when he misrepresented how his 
employment at the hospital ended in December 2003. AG ¶ 16(a) is applicable.  
 
Applicant’s conviction for violating a protective order could have been alleged 
under the criminal conduct guideline. That conduct supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It is also created a vulnerability to 
exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG ¶¶ 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable.  
 
SOR ¶ 2.a cross-alleges the information in SOR ¶ 1.a, which alleged that 
Applicant was delinquent on a $689 debt to a collection company on behalf of a 
 
9 
 
telephone company.16 That debt was paid in February 2011. That debt is insufficient to 
raise personal conduct security concerns. SOR ¶ 2.a is concluded for Applicant. 
 
AG ¶ 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following 
are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
 
Applicant provided false information on his SF 86 about how his employment with 
the county hospital ended. He submitted a copy of his resume as an exhibit. The 
resume is false in that it does not include his job with the hospital, and it shows him 
working for the military during the months he was working at the hospital. He was 
untruthful at his hearing about the theft of government computer equipment. His 
testimony about the circumstances surrounding the domestic violence allegations by his 
ex-girlfriend was not credible. Applicant has not learned that the security clearance 
process demands absolute honesty. There are no mitigating conditions applicable to the 
personal conduct concerns.  
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
16 It appears from Department Counsel’s argument that the Government intended to cross-allege the theft 
of the government computer equipment that was alleged under SOR ¶ 1.r, instead of the debt alleged 
under SOR ¶ 1.a.   
 
 
10 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, 
employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, 
filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches 
of trust. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to pay his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c). Applicant stole computer equipment from his place of employment. AG ¶ 19(d) is 
also established. 
 
Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
 
 
11 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant attributed his financial problems to the loss of his job at the county 
hospital. He testified that his ex-girlfriend called the hospital, told them he had been 
arrested, and sent them copies of the police reports. Applicant’s unemployment does 
not qualify as a condition that was outside his control, because it was caused by his 
conduct. AG ¶ 20(b) is not applicable.  
 
 Applicant received financial counseling and retained a company to assist him 
with his credit report. The first part of AG ¶ 20(c) is applicable. He paid or settled 11 
debts, which totaled about $11,600 of the $37,000 alleged in the SOR. AG ¶ 20(c) is 
applicable to those debts. He successfully disputed four debts totaling about $2,100. AG 
¶ 20(e) is applicable to those debts.  
 
 Applicant has payment plans for the two remaining debts. On April 13, 2011, he 
entered an agreement to settle the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, which had a balance of 
$17,046, with payments of $3,000 on April 26, 2011, and $7,492 on May 24, 2011. 
Applicant testified that he would have no problems making the two payments. He 
entered a new agreement to settle the debt with a payment of $1,500 on April 29, 2011, 
followed by monthly payments of $1,628. Applicant paid $750 on May 2, 2011, and 
another $750 on May 9, 2011. In March 2011, Applicant agreed to a stipulated judgment 
with the SOR ¶ 1.g creditor to pay $650 per month until paid. He agreed to pay $14,176, 
plus $893 court costs, and $500 attorney’s fees. He made the first four $650 payments. 
Applicant paid a total of $4,100 toward these two debts. According to his payment 
agreements, he still has more than $22,000 to be paid on the two debts.  
 
 A security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a 
procedure designed to evaluate an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as 
a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant 
need only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions 
to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the 
SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 I have considered Applicant’s total efforts to pay his delinquent debts, including 
when they were paid. I considered his payments to the two remaining debts, and the 
amounts left to be paid. I also considered that Applicant testified that the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.e would be completely settled by the close of the record, with the first payment to be 
made one week after the hearing. He did not make that payment. His renegotiated 
payment plan is not unreasonable; it is simply not what he testified he would do.

Applicant was not truthful about other matters. His statements that he will continue with 
his payment plans carry little weight under the circumstances. I find there are no 
mitigating conditions applicable to the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g. Those 
debts continue to cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. 
 
 Applicant provided false testimony about the theft of government computer 
equipment. Despite the passage of time since the theft, I am unable to determine that 
behavior is unlikely to recur. It continues to cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. There are no mitigating conditions applicable to 
the security concerns raised by Applicant’s theft of government property. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
I considered Applicant’s honorable service to this country in the U.S. military. 
Applicant addressed 15 of the 17 debts alleged in the SOR. However, all his payments 
came after he received the SOR, and he still has to pay more than $22,000. He stole 
government property; he pleaded guilty under a deferred adjudication to violating a 
protective order; he intentionally falsified his SF 86; and he provided false testimony at 
his hearing. I have significant unresolved doubts about Applicant’s honesty, judgment, 
and trustworthiness. 
 
 
13 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not 
mitigated financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:  For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.h-1.q:  For Applicant 
  
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.b:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.c:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
