Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
he has a problematic financial history, which includes a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case that
ended in a discharge in 2003, and, more recently, delinquent debts totaling more than
$20,000, most of which are unresolved. Although he and his wife have experienced
circumstances largely beyond their control, he has done little to help himself since
beginning his employment with a federal contractor in 2009. It is simply too soon to tell if
or when he will resolve his current financial problems. Applicant failed to present
sufficient evidence to overcome the security concerns stemming from his problematic
financial history. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against
Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    
 Exhibits 7, 8, and 9. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy case is not alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, I have2
considered it for the lim ited purposes of evaluating the evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed
circumstances and when assessing the evidence under the whole-person concept.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 6,1
2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar
to a complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and did not request a hearing, but then
changed his mind and requested a hearing on February 18, 2011. The case was
assigned to two other another administrative judges before it was assigned to me June
10, 2011. The hearing took place August 3, 2011. The transcript (Tr.) was received
August 18, 2011. 
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged a 2003 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case that ended with a discharge
and five delinquent accounts for a total of about $20,598. In Applicant’s reply to the
SOR, he admitted all allegations and provided explanations. His admissions are
accepted as findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact are supported by
substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a federal contractor. His first marriage
ended in divorce in 1987. He married his current wife in 1989. There are no minor
children living in their household.
His employment history includes honorable active duty service in the U.S. Air
Force during 1970–1990, which ended with his retirement as a technical sergeant (E-6).
He receives retirement pay of about $15,000 annually. He held a security clearance
without a negative incident while serving in the Air Force. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute. He and
his current wife have been through bankruptcy twice, a Chapter 13 case that ended in
discharge in 1996 and a Chapter 7 case that ended in discharge in 2003.  The Chapter2

13 case, sometimes called a wage earner’s plan or rehabilitation case, resulted in
Applicant and his wife successfully completing a court-approved plan, which was
confirmed in 1993, and they obtained a final decree and discharge in 1996. The Chapter
7 case, sometimes called a liquidation case, resulted in Applicant and his wife obtaining
a final decree and discharge in 2003. The Chapter 7 case, as revealed in the Schedule
F, includes unsecured debt of approximately $56,000 based on 19 credit card
accounts.  He attributes the Chapter 7 case to becoming overextended on credit card3
debt.  
As alleged in the SOR, and established by Applicant’s admissions and the
documentary evidence, the five delinquent debts are described as follows: 
1. A $297 utility account placed for collection. He has made payments on the debt
and the balance is now about $47.  4
2. A $12,174 credit card account that was charged off. He contacted the creditor by
telephone, but was unable to meet their terms for settlement. He intends to
contact them again when he is in a better financial position.  The debt remains5
unresolved.
3. A $957 credit card account placed for collection. He has made payments on the
debt and the balance is now about $557.6
4. A $678 utility account placed for collection. He was unsure of the status of this
account and had no supporting paperwork.  The debt remains unresolved. 7
5. A $6,492 debt stemming from a repossessed vehicle. He explained the debt was
a deficiency balance owed from the purchase of a new vehicle in 2005, which
ended with repossession the same year. He contacted the creditor by telephone,
but was unable to meet their terms of settlement. He intends to contact them
again when he is in a better financial position.8
By way of explanation,  Applicant stated that he, along with his wife, worked as9
apartment mangers during 1996–2006. After going through the Chapter 7 bankruptcy
 Exhibit B. 10
 Exhibit C. 11

case in 2003, they experienced marital problems that led to their separation from about
September 2004 to February 2005. They maintained separate households during this
time. After resolving their marital problems, they decided to move to another state with
the plan of Applicant starting a handyman business. He was well schooled in this area
after working as an apartment manager for a decade. In August 2006, about a month
after making their move, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which was so serious
that it required immediate surgery. As a result, he was unable to work for three to four
months for recovery and necessary follow-up treatment. Their stay in their new state
was brief, as they returned to their state of current residence in November 2006. The
next year, 2007, proved to be quite difficult. Applicant’s adult son was killed in a
construction accident in August.  Then ten weeks later, the deceased son’s wife died10
due to an accidental overdose. His son’s death resulted in funeral and cemetery
expenses of about $14,646.  The bill was paid by a combination of his son’s employer11
paying $3,939, a donation of $500, and a loan from a friend for $10,706. Applicant was
recently able to repay the loan with $4,000 of his own money and money awarded from
a workers’ compensation case stemming from his son’s death. Those monies have
been rewarded to his son’s minor daughter (his granddaughter). A wrongful death case
is pending. Applicant’s wife is unable to work outside the home due to medical
problems. 
Since returning to their state of current residence in late 2006, his employment
history is as follows: (1) he worked as a maintenance supervisor from November 2006
to August 2007; (2) he worked as a handyman from July 2007 to August 2009; (3) he
was unemployed during September and October 2009; (4) he worked as a general
maintenance worker during October and November 2009; (5) he was unemployed
during November and December 2009; and (6) he began his current job as a fuels
technician/driver in December 2009. 
Applicant’s currently earns about $22 hourly, and he estimated his gross wages
for 2010 at about $35,000 to $40,000. Including his military retired pay, his gross wages
for 2010 were about $50,000 to $55,000. He has no investment account and owns no
real estate. The typical balance in his checking account is less than $1,000. 
Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to12
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to ath
security clearance).

It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As12
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt13
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An14
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  15
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting16
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An17
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate18
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme19
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.20
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept.

is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness or recurring
financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted).

The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it22
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant23
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline24
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  25
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. The 2003 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and five delinquent
accounts for more than $20,000 raise security concerns because they indicate inability
or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations26 27
within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two
disqualifying conditions, and the facts show that Applicant’s financial house is in
disrepair.  
 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999) (“[T]he concept of ‘good faith’ requires a showing that a28
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort).

There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;28
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
I have especially considered the mitigating conditions at AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d).
Nevertheless, none of the mitigating conditions, individually or in combination, are
sufficient to overcome and mitigate the security concerns. 
The evidence of Applicant’s financial problems justifies current doubts about his
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent
standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due consideration to the
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).29
 Tr. 38–51.30
8
whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence, to include his 20 years of29
honorable military service and his good employment record as verified by witness
testimony during the hearing.  And I gave substantial weight to Applicant’s marital30
separation during 2004–2005, his diagnosis and treatment for prostate cancer in 2006,
his short-lived handyman business in 2006, his uneven employment history since 2006,
the tragic death of his son in 2007, and his spouse’s inability to work outside the home
due to medical reasons. These are circumstances largely beyond his control that had a
deleterious or adverse effect on his financial situation. 
With that said, he has done little to help himself since beginning his full-time
employment for a federal contractor in December 2009. For example, although he has
initiated a good-faith effort to repay two of the five delinquent debts at issue, the total
payments to date are about $650, and he has made no progress on the largest two
debts. Had he paid off the three smallest debts (for about $1,932 in total), and
established some sort of track record of consistent payments on the two largest debts,
the outcome of this case may have been different. But at present, Applicant’s
problematic financial history is unresolved and ongoing. That history is simply
inconsistent with the standards that apply to those who are granted access to classified
information. Given Applicant’s long-term history of financial problems, which dates to
the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, it is simply too soon to tell if or when Applicant will
resolve his current financial problems. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.f: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
