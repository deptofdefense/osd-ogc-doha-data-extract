Decision 
______________ 
 
 
MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations concerns. He defaulted 
on the mortgages for four separate investment properties, all four properties were 
recently foreclosed upon, and he failed to handle his financial problems in a responsible 
fashion. Clearance is denied. 
 
Procedural History 
 
On June 8, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) made a 
preliminary determination to deny Applicant access to classified information.1 The basis 
for this decision is set forth in a Statement of Reasons (SOR), which alleges the security 
concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  
 
 Applicant’s response to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 15, 2011 
(Answer). He denied the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.

1 This action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

 On July 29, 2011, Department Counsel filed its ready-to-proceed. After 
coordinating with the parties, I scheduled the hearing for September 22, 2011.  
 
 At hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits that were marked and 
admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant 
appeared at the hearing with counsel and testified. He did not submit any documentary 
exhibits. The transcript was received on September 30, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 34 years old. He graduated college in 1999 with a degree in 
management information systems and was able to land a job in his field of study. He 
then purchased his first home in 2000. He was laid-off in 2001, but was able to keep 
current with his expenses by working several odd jobs until he was able to secure a job 
with a government contractor in 2003. He married in October 2008. A few months later, 
in February 2009, he started a new job with his current employer, also a government 
contractor. Applicant’s income from this new job increased to approximately $145,000 a 
year. He has held a security clearance for over eight years.2  
  
Applicant purchased his first investment property in 2003. He established a real 
estate investment and residential leasing company in 2006. He purchased four 
additional investment properties between 2006 and 2007. These properties were 
financed by mortgages that were generally interest only loans. Some of the properties 
had a first and second mortgage on them. By the end of 2007, Applicant’s real estate 
holdings consisted of six separate properties and the combined amount of his mortgage 
obligations was in excess of two million dollars. Applicant’s annual income at the time 
was roughly $130,000, but he never felt that he was getting in over his head. He 
remained current on the mortgages until his tenants stopped paying their rents in late 
2008, early 2009. He then stopped paying the mortgages on all six properties between 
February and May 2009. He testified that he attempted to resolve his mortgage debts 
with his creditors by either proposing a loan modification or short sale, but failed to 
submit any documentation to corroborate such efforts.3  
 
Applicant secured legal counsel to resolve his financial problem in May 2009. He 
was able to secure a short sale of one of his former investment properties with his 
counsel’s assistance. He moved into another of his former investment properties, made 
it his primary residence, and is paying the mortgage on that property. The remaining 
four properties were foreclosed upon between October 2009 and May 2010.4

Property A was the home Applicant purchased in 2000. The original purchase 
price of the property was $130,000. He did not put any money down and fully financed 
the purchase price. Applicant pulled equity out of the property by twice refinancing his 
mortgage and securing a home equity line-of-credit (HELO). He used the equity to: 
purchase property, pursue other real estate opportunities, convert Property A into a 
multi-family dwelling, and “create supplemental income.”5  
 
The principal loan and the HELO on Property A were with the same lender, and 
the combined amount of these obligations was nearly $600,000. Applicant defaulted on 
both loans and attempted to short sale the property with no success. The lender 
foreclosed on the property in October 2009. With his Answer, Applicant submitted a 
1099-C, Cancelation of Debt, for the primary loan. This is the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. 
The lender has sued Applicant for the amount still owed for the HELO, the second 
mortgage. Applicant’s July 2011 credit report, GE 4, notes that the balance due on this 
charged-off account is $119,000. This is the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant claims 
that the lender’s foreclosure of Property A was illegal and believes such defense will bar 
the lender from recovering the amount owed on the second mortgage. He did not 
present any documentation to substantiate his claim and has not interposed this claim 
as an affirmative defense or as a counter-claim in the current litigation.6 
 
Property B was an investment property Applicant purchased in December 2006 
for approximately $590,000. He financed the purchase price with a first and a second 
mortgage on the property. The property was foreclosed upon in August 2010. Prior to 
the foreclosure, Applicant proposed a loan modification to the lender. The lender 
refused to modify the terms of the mortgages because Applicant had too much 
delinquent debt. These are the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. With his Answer, 
Applicant submitted a 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property, for this 
property. The 1099-A notes that the fair market value of Property B was $383,000 and 
the principal outstanding is $484,800. Applicant’s July 2011 credit report, GE 4, notes 
that the balance due on this account is $88,000. Applicant claims to have a valid legal 
defense as to any amount owed. He claims that prior to closing on the property the 
lender substituted a higher interest rate than what was originally agreed to. He failed to 
submit any documentation to substantiate his claim.7 
 
Property C was the first investment property Applicant purchased in 2003. He 
originally financed the purchase of this property with the funds he secured from 
refinancing the loan on Property A. He eventually secured a mortgage against Property 
C and it was foreclosed upon in September 2010. Prior to the foreclosure, Applicant 
proposed a short sale, but the bank refused the prospective buyer’s offer. With his

Answer, Applicant submitted a 1099-A for Property C. The 1099-A notes that the fair 
market value of Property B was $85,900 and the principal outstanding was $85,849.38. 
Applicant’s July 2011 credit report, GE 4, notes a $0 balance for this account and that 
this Fannie Mae insured loan was “paid for less than full balance.” This is the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.8  
 
 Property D was an investment property Applicant purchased in November 2007 
for approximately $590,000. He fully financed the purchase price by securing a 
mortgage on the property. The lender foreclosed on this property in May 2010. Prior to 
the foreclosure, Applicant proposed a loan modification that the lender rejected. With his 
Answer, Applicant submitted a 1099-A for this property. The 1099-A notes that the fair 
market value of the property was $713,739 and the principal outstanding was $590,000. 
Applicant’s July 2011 credit report, GE 4, notes a $0 balance for this account. This is 
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. Applicant claims he was charged a higher interest rate 
by the lender than he qualified for at the time he secured the mortgage. He has filed a 
lawsuit against the lender.9 
 
 The table below summarizes each of the debts referenced in the SOR and their

e Mortgage on Property D. - Foreclosed in May 2010. 
 
- $0 balance reported on recent credit report. 
 
- Applicant has filed suit against the mortgagee for 
applying a higher interest rate than he qualified for

Applicant “feels that he was a victim of the housing bust and because of the 
changes in the banking industry he was not able to get loan modifications and 
refinances.”10 His “passion is real estate”11 and he “wants to be credit worthy again to 
build his real estate business.”12 He claims to have taken financial counseling in the 
past, but failed to submit documentary proof of such counseling.13 He is current on the 
mortgage on his home, pays about $1,700 a month for a luxury car he owns, and owes 
more than $100,000 in credit card debt.14 
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.  
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

See also GE 2, SI at 6-7, Financial Disclosure Explanation, and Stipulation of Settlement (Applicant 
agreed to payback three delinquent credit card accounts held by one creditor, totaling about $95,000, 
only after being sued by the creditor).

The Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in 
the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. On the other hand, an applicant is responsible for 
presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts 
admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
In resolving this ultimate question, an administrative judge must resolve “[a]ny doubt 
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information . . . in favor 
of national security.” AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
 One aspect of the concern is that an individual who is financially irresponsible 
may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Applicant’s failure to pay his mortgage obligations 
directly implicates the financial considerations concern.  
 
Applicant’s failure to pay his mortgage obligations also establishes a number of 
disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19, namely:  
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 
7 
 
 
                                                          
 However, an applicant’s past or current indebtedness is not the end of the 
analysis, because “[a] security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at 
collecting an applicant’s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an 
applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.”15 Accordingly, Applicant may 
mitigate the financial considerations concern by establishing one or more of the 
mitigating conditions listed under AG ¶ 20. I have considered all the mitigating 
conditions, and find that the following warrant discussion: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Applicant had four separate properties foreclosed upon recently due to his failure 
to meet his substantial mortgage obligation on these properties.16 He still owes 
$207,000 on the second mortgages for Properties A and B.17 He provided no 
documentary proof that he has attempted to resolve these debts.18 One of these debts, 
the $119,000 owed on the second mortgage for Property A, has now been outstanding 
for over 2 years and the creditor has been forced to file a lawsuit to seek payment on 
this debt. Applicant claims he is not liable for these two second mortgages, but failed to 
submit documentary proof to substantiate his claim. Although I recognize that 
Applicant’s financial situation is partially attributable to the recent economic downturn, 
this alone does not mitigate the concern at issue as he has failed to address his debts in 
15 ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). See also ISCR Case No. 09-07916 at 3 
(App. Bd. May 9, 2011). 
 
16 Id. (“even if a debt is legally unenforceable, the government is entitled to consider the facts and 
circumstances surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring the debt and failing to satisfy it in a timely 
manner.” ). 
 
17 ISCR Case 09-07792 at 2 (App. Bd. May 10, 2011) (“. . . evidence that Applicant’s debts 
remained delinquent at the close of the record supports . . . conclusion that these debts were ongoing.”) 
 
18 ISCR Case 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. July 30, 2008) (an applicant is expected to present 
documentation to substantiate their claim about the debts at issue).

a responsible fashion. Applicant obligated himself to pay back the mortgages on these 
four properties – obligations that were well beyond his yearly income. He was wholly 
dependent on receiving rent from his tenants in a timely fashion and being able to 
refinance his properties to pay his mortgage obligations. Applicant continues to see 
himself as merely a “victim” of circumstances, and does not recognize that solely relying 
on rent or other outside factors to pay these mortgages placed him in a financially 
precarious situation.19 He has not engaged in financial counseling or otherwise tailored 
his lifestyle to address his financial situation. He plans on returning to his real estate 
venture in the future without apparently having gained any insight from his current 
situation. Under the circumstances, AG ¶¶ 20(a) through (d) do not apply. Applicant’s 
financial problems continue to cast doubt on his current reliability and good judgment.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a).20 I incorporate my Guideline F analysis herein and 
highlight some additional factors. Applicant has held a clearance for eight years without 
issue. When faced with being laid-off in the past, he was able to stay financially afloat 
by working several odd jobs until he was able to land a well-paying job. He then 
invested in real estate and suffered huge financial losses like many other individuals. He 
is now repaying his sizeable credit card debt and is current on the mortgage on his 
home. However, this favorable evidence, as well as the other mitigating record 
evidence, does not outweigh the security concern at issue. Applicant has failed to 
address his debts in a responsible fashion while having the apparent means to do so, 
as evidenced by having the disposable income to afford a $1,700 a month payment for 
a luxury vehicle. He only started paying back a large portion of his credit card debt after 
being sued by the creditor. The recency and on-going nature of Applicant’s financial 
problems, as well as his failure to establish a permanent change in behavior and the 
likelihood of recurrence, undercuts any whole-person factors.  
 
19 See generally ISCR Case No. 10-01978 (App. Bd. Aug. 24, 2011) (Appeal Board holds that 
application of AG 20(a) - (c) was error in case where applicant purchased multiple homes obligating 
himself to mortgages well beyond his means and then, due to economic downturn, defaulted on the 
mortgages). See also ISCR Case No. 08-1125 (App. Bd. Oct. 4, 2011).  
 
20 (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; 
(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings regarding the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e:              Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence and for the foregoing reasons, it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s request for continued access to 
classified information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is therefore denied.
