HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns in a timely manner for the tax 
years 2003 through 2009 nor did he pay taxes for those years. Additionally, he used 
marijuana from 1998 to 2008 and cocaine from 1998 to 2000. Applicant has rebutted or 
mitigated the security concerns under financial considerations and drug involvement. 
Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DoD) intent to deny or revoke 
his eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive 
Order and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. 
 
1 
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 25, 2011, detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline H, Drug Involvement. 
 
  Applicant’s answer to the SOR was received June 28, 2011, in which he 
requested a hearing. On August 1, 2011, I was assigned the case. On August 16, 2011, 
DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing for the hearing held on August 26, 2011.  
 
 The Government offered exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through O, 
which were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open to allow 
Applicant to submit additional information. Additional material was submitted. 
Department Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the 
record as Ex. P. On September 6, 2011, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he denied the factual allegations in the SOR. 
After a thorough review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following 
findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 44-year-old electronics technician who has worked for a defense 
contractor since March 2010, and he seeks to obtain a security clearance. His annual 
salary is approximately $36,500. (Tr. 49) Applicant called no witnesses other than 
himself. He submitted three character letters from his wife, a friend, and his former 
employer. (Ex. M, N, O) They indicate he is loyal, honest, trustworthy, and a leader. 
 
Applicant was married from August 1985 through December 1993. During his 
marriage, he worked as a carpenter for the school district. (Tr. 40) During his marriage, 
his wife filed their tax returns. (Tr. 40) After his divorce, he could not figure out how to 
file his taxes, so he stopped filing. (Tr. 40) From 1997 or 1998 through 2008, Applicant 
worked for a home improvement firm. He was paid as an independent contractor and 
did not have taxes withheld from his weekly wages. (Ex. 3, Tr. 52)  
 
Applicant’s state of residence does not have a state income tax. (Ex. 3) He 
anticipated receiving a $900 refund from his 1997 or 1998 federal tax return. When the 
anticipated refund was not received, he called the IRS. He was told he that had not filed 
a return and owed $2,700. (Tr. 41) Not only was he unable figure out how to prepare his 
tax returns, he did not have the money to pay the tax owed. (Tr. 42, 56) He did not file 
any tax returns until he filed his 2009 tax return which was due in 2010. In his June 
2010 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), he acknowledged 
he had not filed tax return for several years. He indicated he owed approximately 
$13,323: $471 (2003), $4,176 (2004), $2,739 (2005), $2,447 (2006), $2,383 (2007), 
$813 (2008), and $294 (2009). (Ex. 1)  
 
In March 2010, Applicant hired a tax firm that advertises heavily on late night 
television. (Ex. 3, Ex. D, Tr. 42) He made $630 payments to the tax firm every two 
 
2 
weeks for eight weeks, paying them $4,400 to prepare his returns. (Tr. 47) They 
charged an additional $1,640 to prepare an Offer in Compromise, $420 for an action to 
stay collections, and $360 for a professional staff recommendation report. (Tr. 48) After 
the company filed his returns, the firm estimated he owed the IRS approximately 
$32,000. (Tr. 43) 
 
In June 2010, the IRS told Applicant that he owed $22,490 for tax, interest, and 
penalties for years 2003 through 2009: $953 (2003), $5,312 (2004), $7,051 (2005), 
$4,232 (2006), $3,533 (2007), $1,098 (2008), and $311 (2009). (Ex. 4) As of the 
hearing, he had saved $5,000 to pay on his tax obligation. (Tr. 44) On September 7, 
2011, Applicant submitted copies of five money orders of $1,000 each showing payment 
to the IRS. (Ex. P) 
 
In November 2010, the IRS issued an $8,783 Notice of Levy to Applicant for the 
tax year 2002. (Ex. C) The levy froze $1,185 he had in his account. He paid the tax firm 
$420 for a federal stay of collection, which failed to prevent the accounts assets from 
being taken by the IRS. (Tr. 48) On December 3, 2010, Applicant made an Offer in 
Compromise to the IRS whereby he agreed to pay $8,523. (Ex. A, G) He was required 
to make an immediate $1,705 payment, which he did, and to pay an additional $6,818 
within five months of the acceptance of the offer. (Ex. A) He believed he stilled owed the 
IRS between $1,600 and $1,800. (Tr. 46)  
 
In March 2011, Applicant sought the services of a reputable tax firm to prepare 
his 2010 tax return.  He made a $921 payment to the IRS, which paid his 2010 federal 
taxes. (Ex. K) He intends to continue using this tax firm to prepare his future returns. In 
July 2011, the IRS accepted his Offer in Compromise dated November 2010. (Ex. A) 
 
In Applicant’s e-QIP, he acknowledged smoking marijuana from July 1998 to 
November 2008 and using cocaine from July 1998 through January 2000. (Ex. 1) In 
May 1999, he paid a $500 fine after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana. (Ex. 1) 
He revealed his cocaine use on his e-QIP even though it was beyond the seven-year 
scope of the question. (Tr. 59) Applicant stated he used marijuana in high school, but 
stopped when he got married. (Tr. 59-60) After his divorce, he met an old girlfriend with 
whom he smoked marijuana. (Tr. 60) He no longer sees that woman nor any other 
individuals with whom he smoked marijuana. (Tr. 62) He has not smoked marijuana 
since obtaining his current job. He last used it approximately three years ago. (Tr. 60) 
There are drug tests at his current job. (Tr. 61) He stated he would not use marijuana in 
the future and does not drink alcohol. (Tr. 63)  
 
Applicant is not delinquent on any other debts. (Tr. 39) He has no bad credit and 
no outstanding credit card debt. His 2000 Mazda truck is paid. (Tr. 39) He has no rent 
expenses. (Tr. 51)

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the interests of security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 
2(b) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty 
of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax years 2003 through 
2009. He did so because he did not understand how to complete his tax returns and did 
not have the money to pay his taxes. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or 
unwillingness to satisfy debt,” AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” 
and AG ¶ 19(g), “failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as 
required or the fraudulent filing of the same” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
5 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant did not file his tax returns or pay his federal tax in a timely manner. An 
applicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in 
the SOR. All that is required is for him to demonstrate he has established a plan to 
resolve his delinquent debt and has taken significant action to implement that plan. His 
returns have now been filed, the IRS has accepted an Offer in Compromise, and he has 
paid all but $1,800 of his past due taxes. He paid his 2009 tax in a timely manner. 
 
The mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply because his failure to 
file returns for seven years was not infrequent. The returns were filed in 2010, so his 
failure to file is recent. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. His failure to file was not caused by 
factors beyond his control. He failed to file because he did not understand the tax 
returns and did not have the money to pay his taxes. Failing to understand the tax 
returns or saving sufficient funds through out the year to pay one’s taxes are not 
conditions beyond one’s control.  
 
Although he has not received financial counseling, the problem is being resolved 
and is under control. AG ¶ 20(c) applies. The IRS has accepted his Offer in 
Compromise on which he paid $1,705 in December 2010 and $5,000 in September 
2011. The offer was for $8,523, which leaves a balance of approximately $1,800 yet to 
be paid. His actions represent a good-faith effort to repay the IRS. AG ¶ 20(d) applies. 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because he is not disputing any of his debt.  
 
The remaining $1,800 yet to be paid does not raise concerns about his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Having paid the majority of the debt, I 
believe he will pay the remaining balance. He has no other outstanding obligations.  
 
Drug Involvement 
 
AG ¶ 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: Use of 
an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's 
reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it 
raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and 
regulations. 
 
6 
 
AG ¶ 25 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying: 
 
(a) any drug abuse, and  
 
(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, 
purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; 
 
Applicant used marijuana in high school and again following his divorce. In May 
1999, he paid a $500 fine after pleading guilty to possession of marijuana. (Ex. 1) In AG 
¶ 25(a) drug use and AG ¶ 25(c) for possessed drugs, apply.  
 
AG ¶ 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
 
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, 
 
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of 
clearance for any violation; 
 
 There are no “bright line” rules for determining when conduct is “recent.” The 
determination must be based “on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within 
the parameters set by the directive.” ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 
months before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows “a significant period of 
time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,” then an administrative judge 
must determine whether that period of time demonstrates “changed circumstances or 
conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.”2 
                                                          
2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge’s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the 
absence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge 
excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug 
use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis, the Appeal 
Board stated:  
 
 
7 
Applicant did not attempt to hide his arrest or illegal drug usage on his e-QIP. 
Applicant used cocaine from July 1998 to January 2000. This use was outside the 
scope of inquire on his e-QIP, but he revealed it anyway. His last use of cocaine is 
approximately 12 years ago. His last use of marijuana was in November 2008, 
approximately three years ago. He has not used marijuana since obtaining his current 
job. He no longer associates with those individuals with whom he used marijuana. Due 
to the passage of time since his last cocaine and marijuana use, AG ¶ 26(a) applies. 
This period of abstinence and disassociation from drug-using associates allows AG ¶ 
26(c) to apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
Compare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage 
of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel 
the administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of 
law, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply 
that mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR 
Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (“The administrative judge articulated a 
rational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at 
alcohol rehabilitation.”) (citation format corrections added). 
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency 
analysis of an administrative judge stating: 
 
The administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of 
improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security 
clearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year 
from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing]. It also included the illegal 
purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. 
 
 
8 
 
9 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. His illegal drug use is sufficiently old 
as not to be a current security concern. He has reached an agreement with the IRS to 
pay his past-due taxes. He paid one tax firm almost $7,000 to address his past failures 
to file timely returns. He now employs a different tax firm to file his returns and intends 
to continue using that firm in the future. It is unlikely Applicant will be late in filing his tax 
returns.  
Other than the remaining $1,800 he owes the IRS, he has no additional past-due 
obligations. He is not living beyond his means. He is driving a 2000 Mazda truck. The 
issue is not simply whether all his taxes are paid or are being paid – which they are – it 
is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security 
clearance. (See AG & 2 (a)(1).) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without 
questions or doubts about Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from 
his financial considerations and illegal drug use.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a –1.c:  For Applicant 
   
 Paragraph 2, Drug Involvement:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
