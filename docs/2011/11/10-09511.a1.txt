APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On February 13, 2011, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant
of the basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)
of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a decision on the written record.  On September 21, 2011, after considering the record,
Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.
Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether there is a nexus between
Applicant’s circumstances and a risk to the national security and whether the Judge’s adverse
decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm the
decision.
Applicant disclosed substantial adverse information in his April 2010 security clearance
application including: (1) he filed bankruptcy; (2) he had possessions or property repossessed or
foreclosed; (3) he had failed to pay federal, state, or other taxes; (4) a lien had been placed against
his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts; (5) he had defaulted on a loan; (6) he had bills
or debts turned over to a collection agency; (7) he had an account or credit card suspended, charged
off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; and (8) he had been over 180 days delinquents on
debts.
In July 2010, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
investigator.  During the interview, Applicant attributed his financial problems in large part to a
failed trucking business that he owned from 2003 to 2009. In late 2007, his two largest customers
went out of business, and he also began losing customers to larger trucking companies. He used his
personal credit cards to keep his business afloat.  Applicant failed to pay income taxes, using the
money to make payroll instead.  At the time he closed his business down, he estimated that he was
approximately $250,000 in debt.  Applicant stated during his July 2010 interview that he intends to
pay all of his debts from his salary. He expects to earn $700 per day with minimal expenses. He
estimated that his debt at the time of the July 2010 interview was $200,000.  Applicant predicted that
he would be able to pay off all of his debt in two years if employed by his sponsoring employer.
Applicant’s SOR is broken down into two parts. The first part alleges 11 separate delinquent
debts totaling approximately $134,508. The second part alleges 35 separate delinquent debts that
were included in Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in September 2008. The total amount of
these additional 35 debts totals approximately $328,690. Applicant’s September 2008 bankruptcy
was dismissed in May 2009 for failure to make payments as agreed. 
Applicant’s numerous debts include four separate delinquent debts owed to the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS), totaling $188,741, as well as an additional $27,334 owed to his state tax
authority.  Applicant explained that his decision to “delay” payment of taxes was the only reasonable
choice he had at the time. He added that by delaying payment of his taxes, he was able to meet
payroll and keep his business afloat, at least for a while. His bankruptcy petition lists $237,190 in
liabilities.
Applicant’s SOR Answer  and his Response to the FORM contain lengthy explanations of
the origin of his business-related and personal debts.  He states that he will be able to begin or
resume payment on these debts once his employment stabilizes. Applicant states that he has been
able to pay off five debts, two of which were alleged in the SOR. Applicant did provide
documentation in his Answer to the SOR that he had paid some of his creditors; however, it is
difficult to determine with certainty from the documents in the FORM which SOR debts, if any,
have been paid or addressed.  The venue precludes an administrative judge from going outside the
four corners of the documents contained in the FORM.  
In the Analysis, the Judge concluded that Applicant had failed to demonstrate responsible
action with regard to his debts.  He concluded that Applicant’s indebtedness was sizable and
ongoing.  Accordingly, he concluded that Applicant had not mitigated the security concerns raised
by the SOR.
On appeal, Applicant argues that his financial situation does not demonstrate that it is
improper for him to have a security clearance.  The Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational
connection between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant’s security
eligibility.  Security clearance determinations are not limited to consideration of work performance
or conduct during duty hours.  The absence of security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse
security clearance decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-00505 at 2 (App. Bd.  Jan. 26, 2010).  The
federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles or fails to safeguard
classified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See Adams v. Laird,
420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  Furthermore, direct or objective evidence of nexus is not
required.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-16765 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2009).
Applicant discusses his interpretation of the record evidence.  However, the brief is not
sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge mis-weighed Applicant’s testimony on these matters, nor
is it sufficient to undermine the Judge’s finding that there was little or no corroboration for
Applicant’s claims.  A Judge is presumed to have considered all of the record evidence.  Applicant
has not rebutted this presumption, nor has he demonstrated that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence.
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-06691 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011).  Furthermore, a party’s
disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the record evidence or an ability to argue for an
alternative interpretation of the record evidence is not sufficient to demonstrate error.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 08-08944 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009).
Applicant’s cites to Hearing Office decisions he contends are similar to his case.  While
decisions by Hearing Office Judges in other cases may be cited as persuasive authority, those cases
are not binding legal precedent which a Hearing Office Judge must follow in another situation.
Applicant’s reliance on other Hearing Office decisions does not demonstrate that the Judge erred
in this case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-03845 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2009).
The record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated
a satisfactory explanation for the decision, “including a ‘rational connection between the facts found
and the choice made.’”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.
Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168
(1962)).  The Judge’s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that
a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”
Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).
