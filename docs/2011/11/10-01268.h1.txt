Decision
______________
METZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:
Based on the record in this case,  Applicant’s clearance is denied.1
On 12 August 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline
F, Financial Considerations.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, requesting a hearing.2
DOHA assigned the case to me 6 October 2011, and I convened a hearing 17
November 2011. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 28 November 2011.
Applicant claimed for the first time at hearing (Tr. 42) that SOR debts 1.k and 1.n were for the same3
repossession. However, that claim is belied by Applicant’s credit reports, his own earlier statements, and his
testimony. Applicant testified (Tr. 32) that he has several repossessions. His September 2009 credit report
(GE 4) shows that the $30,524 individual automobile loan Applicant took out in June 2005 was current, with
a reported balance of $20,549 and no amount past due. The same credit report showed a $19,705 joint
automobile loan taken out by Applicant in June 2004, charged off in March 2007 for $5,566, with a $5,096 past
due balance remaining. Applicant discussed this delinquent debt with a government investigator in October
2009 (GE 2) and acknowledged that it was a joint debt that he and his  first wife incurred, but could not agree
how to resolve. In his May 2011 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 3), Applicant documented his
agreement to settle the remaining debt for $3,245, payable in 24 monthly payments of $135. Nevertheless,
Applicant has made none of the required payments. In the same interrogatories, Applicant claimed without
corroboration to have settled the $20,549 debt for $15,999 payable in $100 monthly installments. Again, none
of the required payments have been made.

Findings of Fact
Applicant admitted SOR financial allegations 1.a, 1.e, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n-1.s. He
denied SOR 1.b-1.d, 1.f-1.j, and 1.m, claiming that he had paid seven accounts and was
paying on two others. He is a 43-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense
contractor since January 2005. He seeks to retain the clearance he was granted in
about January 2005.
Applicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to at least March 2001,
when he filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection to rid himself of over $15,000 in
unsecured debt. He acquired the debts while he was in the military, and just could not
stay current with the payments after he  got married in September 1995 and got out of
the military in April 1997. He received his discharge in June 2001. Although Applicant
denies having received bankruptcy protection under chapter 13 in 1994, the bankruptcy
petition prepared by Applicant’s lawyer records just such a discharge, on the signature
page where Applicant validated the chapter 7 filing (GE 3).
The SOR alleges 18 delinquent debts totaling over $64,000. However, the
judgments at SOR 1.o and 1.p appear to constitute SOR debt 1.b, reducing the total
amount owed to just under $62,000. Further, the actual delinquent debt at SOR 1.k is
$20,549, not $30,000, and the actual delinquent debt at SOR 1.n is $5,096, not
$19,000, further reducing the delinquent debt to about $38,500 (GE 4). Applicant denied
about $5,100 delinquent debt, admitting the rest. The bulk of the debt is for a $20,549
automobile repossession (SOR 1.k) and a $5,096 automobile repossession (SOR 1.n).3
Another $4,000 is for another delinquent education loan (SOR 1.l).
Applicant claims to have paid seven debts totaling $600, but his evidence proves
only that he settled five medical debts totaling $347 (SOR 1.f-1.j) in May 2011 (Answer),
along with seven medical debts not alleged in the SOR. He documented a repayment
plan for SOR debt 1.m, which showed four $100 payments February-May 2011.
However, the payments were credited to accrued interest, and the balance on the
account has grown to nearly $2,400 (Answer). He has not made all the scheduled
payments since May 2011, so he has still not begun reducing the principal balance (Tr.
3
56). In addition, although his answer claimed to be paying on SOR debt 1.b, he had only
proposed a repayment schedule, which the creditor rejected (Tr. 44).
Applicant filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2001 because of several
individual debts that he was just not able to bring under control. However, his financial
difficulties resumed in 2001-2002 when he and his first wife were experiencing marital
difficulties. He made good money, but she did not work, and both of them had poor
spending habits. In addition, his employment was subject to the vagaries of government
contract work and he had some health problems between 2005 and 2008. Applicant’s
first marriage ended in 2005, and when he remarried in 2008, his second wife brought
financial problems of her own to the marriage. 
Applicant attributes his financial problems largely to his separation and divorce.
He moved out of the marital home—solely owned by his ex-wife—in December 2004,
and remained homeless for all practical purposes until 2007. Nevertheless, he bought a
$30,000 automobile in 2005 because he was angry about the divorce and thought he
deserved a new automobile (Tr. 41). He was hospitalized for three days in March 2005,
but the stay was covered by medical insurance. However, because Applicant’s job
changes sometimes meant changes in his medical insurance, he sometimes
experienced problems sorting out which insurer should be paying the bills. Applicant
claims without corroboration to have been unemployed for about a month in late 2007-
early 2008. Nevertheless, Applicant’s July 2005 clearance application (GE 1) shows
continuous employment from at least May 1997. 
In 2009, Applicant and his second wife began working with a credit counseling
organization that sensibly recommended that they pay their small debts quickly and
begin saving to be able to address their larger debts from a position of strength, that is,
by being able to accept whatever settlement offer was made by the creditor once
contact was made. The credit counselor prepared a budget that shows that Applicant
has $700 positive monthly cash flow even with allowance for what the counselor calls
the “Murphy’s law” factor. The budget also shows Applicant making $700 monthly
charitable contributions.
However, Applicant’s progress under the plan has been painfully slow. His
evidence shows that he paid four outstanding medical bills (not alleged in the SOR)
totaling about $530 in May 2011, and also settled another 12 accounts totaling about
$740 for $595 in May 2011. Those 12 accounts include five accounts totaling $347
alleged in the SOR. Applicant made total payments of $400 on a repayment plan (1.m)
but has not been able to keep up with the payments. Applicant’s ability to work on
repaying the SOR debt has been hampered by his repaying legal fees he incurred in
2009 trying to reduce his child support payments from $1,400 to $1,000 per month (AE
A). He has been repaying $300 per month on that debt. However, it is not clear why
Applicant incurred that debt, since Applicant and his wife came to a mutual agreement
to reduce the child support to $1,100 per month, and that figure was never judicially
confirmed (Tr. 36-37).
See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).4
¶19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;5
4
Applicant has a $20,000-30,000 retirement account with his current employer
that both he and his employer make contributions to. His interest in the account will vest
in two years, meaning he will be able to borrow against the balance to address his
larger debts, which is his plan. He has never been delinquent with the rent at his current
home (AE B).
Policies
The adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person’s suitability for
access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and
mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.
Each decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is
not, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case
can be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or
denial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,
the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).
Security clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant or continue an applicant’s security clearance. The Government
must prove, by substantial evidence, disputed facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the
burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.
Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden
of persuasion.
Persons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship
with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a
compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,
reliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.
The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard compels deciding any
reasonable doubt about an Applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4
Analysis
The Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and
Applicant did not fully mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has a history of financial
problems dating back to at least 2001, if not 1994. The financial problems appear to be
due to his financial mismanagement and not any one factor, or combination of factors,
beyond his control. Applicant has over $38,000 in unresolved debt.  In keeping with the5
recommendations of his credit counselor, he has not been in contact with any of the
creditors, waiting until he has sufficient money to pay whatever lump sum settlement he
might be able to negotiate.
¶ 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that6
it is  unlikely to recur . . . 
¶ 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control . . . and7
the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
¶ 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.8
¶ 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications9
that the problem is being resolved or is under control;
5
Applicant does not fully meet any mitigating factors for financial considerations,
and the partial application of the mitigating conditions is insufficient to overcome the
adverse implications of his current financial situation. His financial difficulties are recent
and ongoing, and apparently not under circumstances unlikely to recur.  Overall,6
Applicant has not acted responsibly in addressing his debts.  Applicant has been7
working with a credit counselor for over two years, and has significant positive monthly
cash flow, yet has documented payments of only $1,500, about half of which is SOR
debt. These payments are inadequate to constitute a good faith effort to address his
debts  or to demonstrate that his financial problems are headed for resolution.  The8 9
financial counseling he has undertaken has resulted in very little progress. The
unplanned legal expenses were incurred to reduce his child support obligation. Even
recognizing the drain those expenses placed on his finances, Applicant still had
discretionary income that could have been used to address the next level of debts
(those more than $200. Apparently, he intends to take no further action on his debts
until he fully vests in his retirement accounts in two years. This is too open ended a plan
to mitigate the security concerns raised by his financial problems. Further, the record
lacks any information upon which to base a “whole-person” analysis. Applicant has a
long term plan, but very little short term progress. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F
against Applicant.

Conclusion
Under the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for
Applicant. Clearance denied.
