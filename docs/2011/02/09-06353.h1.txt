MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant stopped paying rent to a former landlord after he had to break his lease. His 
truck loan, a consumer credit account for electronic equipment, and several medical debts 
became delinquent due to the seasonal nature of his employment and his eventual layoff in 
December 2008. As of February 2010, he owed around $21,436.17 in past due debt. He 
began repaying his debts in August 2009, and has since paid in full or settled the remaining 
balances. Clearance granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On February 26, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations, which provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a 
security clearance. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective 
within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

Applicant initially responded to the SOR on March 12, 2010. He requested a hearing 
but did not admit or deny each of the allegations of the SOR. On April 12, 2010, he 
submitted an answer in which he admitted the allegations in SOR 1.a, 1.c, 1.h, 1.m, and 
1.n. He denied SOR 1.l, and indicated he did not recognize the medical debts alleged in 
SOR 1.b, 1.d–1.g, and 1.i–1.k. On May 4, 2010, the case was assigned to me to consider 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. On May 17, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for June 9, 2010. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant was represented by the chief 
steward of his union. Six Government exhibits (Ex. 1-6.) were entered into evidence. Exhibit 
2 was admitted over Applicant‟s objection. Incorporated in Exhibit 2 is a report of subject 
interview that contained information concerning alcohol-related incidents that were not 
alleged in the SOR. Department Counsel asserted that the document was offered solely for 
the financial information. I admitted the document in full for consideration of the information 
relevant and material to Applicant‟s financial situation. Through his union steward, Applicant 
submitted 11 exhibits (Ex. A-K) that were accepted into the record without objection. 
Applicant also testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 18, 2010. 
 
At Applicant‟s request, I held the record open initially until June 23, 2010, for the 
receipt of additional financial documentation. Five more exhibits were timely received (Ex. L-
P) and entered without objection. On June 23, 2010, I granted Applicant a three-week 
extension, until July 14, 2010, to submit additional documents. On July 23, 2010, Applicant 
offered proposed exhibits Q through T, which were entered without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of February 
26, 2010, Applicant owed $3,897 to a former landlord (SOR 1.a), $2,545 in medical debt in 
collection (SOR 1.b, 1.d–1.f, 1.i–1.k), $13,527 for a repossessed vehicle (SOR 1.c), $137 in 
cable television debt (SOR 1.h), $1,602 in delinquent credit card debt (SOR 1.l), $136 for 
insurance (SOR 1.m), and $391 in past due telephone charges (SOR 1.n). In his Answer, 
Applicant admitted the debts for the leased apartment (SOR 1.a), truck (SOR 1.b), cable 
television (1.1.h), insurance (SOR 1.m) and telephone (SOR 1.n). He denied the credit card 
delinquency and indicated he did not recognize the medical debts. After considering the 
pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old divorced male, who has been employed as a grinder for a 
defense contractor since April 2009. He had worked for the company previously from 
January 1975 to May 1980. (Ex. 1.) Applicant held a confidential-level security clearance 
during 2007 and 2008 while working as a foreman for a gas pipeline company. (Ex. 1.) 
 
Applicant worked for a natural gas pipeline company from November 1999 to 
December 2008. (Ex. 1.) The work was seasonal in nature, so there were long stretches 
when he earned no income. He worked full-time hours when he was on the job. (Tr. 32.) In 
May 2001, Applicant bought a truck for $38,000, taking out a loan of $25,194 that he repaid 
at $530 per month until December 2002 when he was without work. He subsequently 
 
 3 
received two notices requesting payment. He did not respond because he had no earned 
income. (Tr. 79.) Around May 2003, Applicant stopped paying his rent on an apartment that 
he shared with his brother. (Ex. 2; Tr. 93.) Around July 2003, Applicant‟s truck was 
repossessed and sold at auction. He was left owing a deficiency balance around $8,998 
(Ex. 2; 4; 5; L.), although Applicant thought that he had no further obligation after the truck 
was sold. (Tr. 33, 68.) In January 2004, the creditor referred a $9,398 balance for collection 
(SOR 1.c). (Ex. 4.)  In April 2005, Applicant‟s former landlord placed a $4,197 balance for 
back rent and other fees for collection (SOR 1.a). (Ex. 2; 4; 5.) 
 
After nine years working off and on for the natural gas company, Applicant was laid 
off in December 2008. (Ex. 1; Tr. 62.) In February 2009, he incurred $333 in medical costs 
at a local hospital. The charges were satisfied with a final payment applied March 4, 2010 
(Ex. J.), but he owed other medical debts incurred when he was out of work in the past. (Ex. 
4.) 
 
In April 2009, Applicant started working for his current employer. On June 11, 2009, 
he completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on which 
he responded affirmatively to questions 26.f, “Have you ever defaulted on any type of 
loan?,” 26.g, “Have you had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency?,” and 26.n, 
“Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” (Ex. 1.) Applicant indicated he 
had paid an $800 hospital debt in June 2006, and his truck loan had been paid in full after 
auction in May 2002. He disclosed unpaid medical debt, but indicated that he had made 
repayment arrangements. (Ex. 1.) 
 
A check of Applicant‟s credit on June 25, 2009, revealed an unpaid deficiency 
balance on the truck loan, and some consumer credit debts not listed on his e-QIP. (Ex. 4.)  
On July 16, 2009, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator, in part about his 
finances. He disclosed that he incurred a hospital debt of $500 around January 2009.
1
 
Applicant denied he had received any notice of a deficiency balance on his loan for his truck 
after the vehicle was auctioned, although he did not dispute the reported debt. Concerning 
the apartment debt, Applicant admitted that he had stopped paying rent, and indicated it 
was because he had been confined to jail for four months for drunk driving.
2
 He contested 
the amount of the debt, which he believed was around $2,000 rather than the reported 
$4,197.  Applicant did not recognize several of the medical debts in collection. (Ex. 2.) 
 
                                                 
1
Available hospital billing records (Ex. J) indicate Applicant incurred medical charges of $175 in February 2009, 
and that he paid $333 to the hospital over the next year. He was refunded $374 in May 2010. (Ex. F.) 
 
2 
Applicant indicated on July 16, 2009, that the DUI offense occurred in November 2003, and that he was jailed 
from January to May (dates not recalled). On July 22, 2009, he clarified that his last DUI was instead in 
November 2001, and that he was incarcerated from January to May 2002. (Ex. 2.) Yet, in his answer and at his 
hearing, Applicant indicated that he broke his lease in 2002 because he had to move on short notice for a job 
assignment. (Tr. 70.) He later testified that he moved just before the DUI charge. Credit reports indicate a last 
activity date of May 2003 on the debt, but the creditor‟s records reflect that he owed $360.85 as of August 2003, 
and did not pay any of his $629 monthly rent starting in September 2003. (Ex. L.) Applicant could have been 
mistaken about the dates of his incarceration, but even if he stopped paying rent because of his imprisonment, 
his alcohol use was not the primary cause of his financial problems. 
 
 4 
Applicant made little effort to resolve his debts before August 2009. He spent about 
$3,000 to $5,000 for his mother‟s care in a convalescent home and later her funeral 
between April 2009 and September 2009. (Tr. 72-73.) On receipt of a collection notice, he 
began repaying the apartment debt (SOR 1.a) in August 2009. (Ex. A; Tr. 75.) Applicant 
borrowed $5,000 from his 401(k) account to cover his mother‟s expenses, the payments on 
the apartment debt, and the payment on the loan for his current vehicle. (Tr. 94.) As of June 
2010, Applicant was repaying his 401(k) loan at $21 weekly. (Tr. 102-03.) He had repaid 
about $1,000 of the 401(k) funds as of early June 2010. (Tr. 103.) 
 
In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on November 6, 2009, that 
he did not owe a deficiency balance on the truck loan (SOR 1.c) because the vehicle had 
been repossessed. He acknowledged owing the medical debts in SOR 1.b., 1.d, and 1.e. 
He also did not dispute the cable television (SOR 1.h) and telephone (SOR 1.n) debts, 
which he attributed to his relocation for a job with the pipeline. He also did not contest that 
he owed his former landlord (SOR 1.a). However, he denied any recognition of the debts in 
SOR 1.f–1.g and 1.i–1.m. (Ex. 3.)

 As of early June 2010, Applicant‟s hourly wage at his defense contractor employment 
was $19.26, which was sufficient to cover his living expenses. He accepts whatever 
overtime is available, and is paid $26 an hour for that time. (Tr. 96.) He has medical 
insurance. Applicant rents a room near his work at $125 per week, inclusive of utilities and 
cable television. (Tr. 86-87, 105-06.) He has discretionary funds of about $100 a month, 
which were going toward his old debts as of June 2010. (Tr. 63-64, 66.) Applicant is paying 
$300 a month for a 2003 model-year economy car that he bought in 2007, using his income 
tax refunds for a down payment. (Tr. 81.) Applicant owes around $1,600 to $1,800 on his 
current car loan. (Tr. 95.) Applicant does not have a credit card account. (Tr. 87.) He has 
about $500 in passbook savings. (Tr. 100.) He has not received any financial counseling, 
although he has been living according to a budget that he prepared for himself in early 
2009. (Tr. 100.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a „right‟ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant‟s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are 
not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge‟s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number 
of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
                                                 
4 
Applicant testified that he intended to borrow around $9,000 from his family. (Tr. 54, 69.) 
 
 7 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, 
Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18, as follows:  
     
Failure or inability to live within one‟s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG ¶ 
19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant began to have financial problems in late 2002. He stopped paying on his 
truck loan and the vehicle was repossessed, leaving him with a debt of $8,998. Even if he 
was unaware that he owed a deficiency balance after the truck was sold at an auction, he 
knew that he had defaulted on the loan. In spring 2003, while he was out of work (Tr. 85.), 
he ceased paying for about $700 in electronic equipment that he had purchased to help a 
nephew, and the debt continued to mount. Between September 2003 and February 2004, 
he did not pay his rent for an apartment that he shared with his brother. In addition to the 
$6,517 in outstanding debt for the rent and electronic equipment, he failed to pay a cable 
television debt of $137 and telephone charges of $391 from 2003. And he continued to 
incur medical debt that was not covered by insurance. By early 2009, he owed around 
$2,617 in delinquent medical expenses. Even if he overlooked the $136 insurance debt in 
SOR 1.m, he knew he was seriously in default on several other obligations. AG ¶ 19(a) and 
¶ 19(c) are clearly implicated. 
 
 
 8 
The Government‟s case for application of AG ¶ 19(f), “financial problems that are 
linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling problems, or other issues of security concern,” is 
not clearly established. There is conflicting evidence about whether Applicant may have 
stopped paying his rent because of his incarceration following his third DUI offense.
5
 (Ex. 2.) 
While Applicant may have spent funds on alcohol before then that could have gone instead 
to paying his financial obligations, several of the debts in the SOR were incurred after he 
had stopped drinking. Inconsistent income and lack of medical insurance were the primary 
causes of his financial problems. 
 
Four Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual‟s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person‟s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
 
Applicant‟s financial problems are too recent to favorably consider AG ¶ 20(a). As of 
his June 2009 e-QIP, Applicant had taken no steps to resolve any of his old delinquencies. 
However, AG ¶ 20(b) applies in that insufficient income due to the seasonal nature of his 
work and the lack of medical insurance at times contributed to, if not caused, his inability to 
remain current in his payments. Non-discretionary medical expenses, such as he incurred 
for treatment of a broken hand in 2006, are not counted against him. Applicant‟s purchase 
of electronic equipment for his nephew could be considered an irresponsible expenditure, 
but it would be less so if he had sufficient income to make the monthly payments when he 
took on the debt in March 2001. With no evidence of his income and expenses during this 
period, it is difficult to conclude that he acted responsibly when he took on that debt. He 
admitted receiving a couple of bills from the creditor, but he was on unemployment at the 
time. (Tr. 85.) Applicant also had an obligation to determine whether he owed anything on 
his truck loan after his vehicle was repossessed, and he apparently just assumed that he 
had no further obligation after it was sold. Applicant failed to act responsibly as well in the 
handling of his apartment debt. He knew that he had broken the lease, whether it was 
because he had to move for his job, was incarcerated, or for some other cause such as 
                                                 
5 
See footnote 2, supra. 
 
 9 
unemployment. AG ¶ 20(b) does not mitigate his failure to timely notify his creditors of his 
financial situation. 
 
However, Applicant had a reasonable explanation for the delay in addressing his 
debts in 2009. He was unemployed from December 2008 until April 2009, and incurred 
expenses for his mother‟s care and then her funeral. Since August 2009, he has taken 
sufficient steps to resolve his debts to qualify for mitigation under AG ¶ 20(c) and ¶ 20(d). 
Documentation submitted during and after his hearing substantiates that the debts in the 
SOR have been satisfied or settled under terms acceptable to his creditors, in part with his 
income tax refunds. Assuming he acted on his stated intent, Applicant borrowed from his 
family some if not all of the $6,675.84 in funds that he paid to his creditors after his June 9, 
2010, hearing. While he will have to start repaying any funds borrowed from his family 
immediately, his current financial situation is stable. Applicant lives frugally and takes 
advantage of overtime opportunities at work, so he is likely to repay the funds lent to him on 
terms acceptable to his family provided he has stable employment. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant‟s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and all 
relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual‟s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
Applicant failed to act proactively in the past to address debts that had become 
delinquent. Yet once he was in a position to make some payments, he began to clean up 
his credit. In response to a collection notice from his former landlord, he paid $1,100 toward 
that debt before the SOR was issued. He exhibited good faith by continuing to make 
payments toward his old debts until they were satisfied in full or settled, and he is not 
continuing to incur new delinquencies. Based on the information before me, I conclude that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance at this time.
