Summary of Case 
 
Applicant was born in Egypt in 1960. He immigrated to the United States in 1979 
and became a U.S. citizen in 1990. His spouse was born in the United States; however, 
she lived in Syria from the age of 3 to 19. She currently lives in the United States and 
has a Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD)-issued security clearance. She works 
as a linguist. However, she traveled to Syria in 2007, and she communicates with 
several aunts and uncles, who live in Syria. Applicant’s two children are U.S. citizens 
and live in the United States. Applicant is a DoD linguist with an exceptional record of 
service in Iraq. The allegation that Applicant contacted a terrorist entity in Pakistan is 
not substantiated. Foreign influence concerns raised by his spouse’s connection to 
Syria are mitigated. 
 
Applicant had a 1989 DUI and was arrested in 2002 for impersonating a police 
officer. He failed to disclose these two events on his 2004 security clearance application 
(SF-86). In 1992, Applicant’s fiancée obtained a restraining order against him, which he 
violated. In 2003-2004, he engaged in sexual behavior with prostitutes in Southwest 
Asia. In January 2004, he was accused of threatening his site manager in Iraq. All of the 
personal conduct allegations, except for the allegation concerning his sexual 
involvement with prostitutes, are mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.

History of the Case 
 
On August 1, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing version of his security clearance application (e-QIP version) 
(hereinafter SF-86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On August 20, 2010, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
alleging security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign influence) and E (personal 
conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) 
promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005. The SOR detailed reasons why 
DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

On October 6, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. On November 1, 2010, Department Counsel was 
prepared to proceed. On November 3, 2010, the case was assigned to me. The hearing 
was delayed while Applicant unsuccessfully sought documentation concerning his 
alleged contact with a terrorist organization in Pakistan. (Tr. 22-23) On December 13, 
2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice and the hearing was held on January 25, 2011. At 
the hearing, Department Counsel offered 13 exhibits (GE 1-13) (Transcript (Tr.) 26), 
and Applicant offered 20 exhibits (AE A-T). (Tr. 24-25, 39-40) Applicant objected to my 
consideration of GE 3, and I overruled that objection. See Procedural Rulings, infra. 
There were no objections to the other exhibits, and I admitted GE 1-13, and AE A-T. (Tr. 
27, 40) Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notice. 
(HE 1-3) On February 2, 2011, I received the hearing transcript. I held the record open 
until February 3, 2011. (Tr. 167, 219) After the hearing, Applicant provided 13 exhibits, 
which were admitted without objection. (AE U-AH)1 Applicant also provided one 
correction to the transcript. (HE 4) 
 
Procedural Rulings 
 
On December 1 and 3, 2010, Applicant requested information from the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concerning the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a that Applicant “had 
contact with an entity in Pakistan which has been linked to a known terrorist 
organization.” (AE Z, AH)  
 
Applicant objected to my consideration of GE 3, a November 22, 2010, FBI 
memorandum written to DOHA. GE 3 states, “FBI investigation has determined a 
possible contact between [Applicant] and an entity in Pakistan which has been linked to 
a known terrorist organization.” Some of the basis of this statement is classified. (Tr. 32-
33) Applicant objected to the failure to provide discovery concerning the basis of this 
FBI’s statement. (Tr. 28-34, 37-38, 174-76) Department Counsel described GE 3 as an 
admissible summary of a police record and cited ISCR Case No. 03-06770 (App. Bd. 
Sept. 9, 2004) to support admissibility. (Tr. 35-36) I overruled the objection and 
concluded the objection went to the weight of the evidence, rather than to its 
admissibility. (Tr. 37) I also noted the document had minimal probative value as 
“possible contact” showed a speculative and tenuous association between Applicant 
and a Pakistani-terrorist entity. (Tr. 37) Applicant also objected to the hearing statement 
of an FBI special agent that explained the basis of the FBI’s conclusion that there was a 
“possible” contact between Applicant and the terrorist entity. (Tr. 177, 179, 189) I 
overruled these objections. (Tr. 177, 179, 189) Department Counsel had previously 
received a classified FBI report; however, the FBI refused to grant permission to release 
that report to Applicant, and the classified FBI report was not provided to me. (Tr. 38-39) 
Additional information concerning GE 3 is in the section “Link to a known terrorist 
organization in Pakistan,” infra at page 5.  
 
Department Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning Syria 
and Pakistan (Tr. 11). Department Counsel provided supporting documents to show 
detail and context for the facts in the request. Applicant did not object to me taking 
 
1I marked each document as a separate exhibit. (AE U to AH)

administrative notice of the facts concerning Syria. (Tr. 11, 17) The Syria section of the 
Findings of Fact of this decision, infra, contains the material facts from Department 
Counsel’s submissions on Syria.   
 
Applicant objected to Department Counsel’s administrative notice request 
concerning Pakistan, arguing it was not relevant because of the lack of evidence of a 
connection between Applicant and Pakistan. (Tr. 11-16) Department Counsel explained 
that Applicant’s connection to Pakistan was a telephone call from Applicant’s telephone 
to a terrorist organization in Pakistan several years ago. Department Counsel agreed to 
narrow his request for administrative notice to a statement that the Pakistan 
Government has a serious problem with terrorism, and there are allegations of linkage 
between the Pakistani intelligence service and the Taliban and some terrorist 
organizations. (Tr. 14) I overruled Applicant’s relevancy objection. (Tr. 14, 16) 
Department Counsel’s request for administrative notice concerning Pakistan, along with 
related documents, is attached to the record.   
 
Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for 
administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 
2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice in ISCR 
proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or derived from government 
reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing 
fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs 
1.b to 1.d, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d with mitigating explanations to be made at his hearing. (HE 
3) He denied the remaining allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make 
the following findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old linguist, who has been employed by defense 
contractors for about eight years. In 1960, Applicant was born in Egypt. (Tr. 43) In 1979, 
he moved to the United States. (Tr. 43,195) In 1990, he became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 43) 
He married his spouse in May 2007. (Tr. 149) He has two children from a pervious 
marriage. (Tr. 41) He attended college from 1980 to 1983; however, he did not receive a 
degree. (SF-86, GE 1)  
 
 
2The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations 
to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. 
Applicant’s October 10, 2006, May 14, 2007, and June 21, 2007, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
interviews and his September 9, 2008, 33-page affidavit contain thorough descriptions of matters of security 
concern. (GE 2, 4) 
 
 
5 
                                                                                                                                              
                                           
After September 11, 2001, Applicant and his father wanted to help the United 
States against the terrorists. (Tr. 44-45) They both sought employment with the U.S. 
Government as linguists. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant’s father was deployed as a linguist and 
analyst to Guantanamo Bay for about four years,3 and Applicant was eventually 
deployed to Iraq in 2003. (Tr. 45, 95) Applicant was assigned to a Marine Corps unit, 
which was one of the first units to enter Iraq in March 2003. (Tr. 47-48) He assisted in 
the interrogations of prisoners of war, and helped locate weapons caches. (Tr. 48) He 
also helped locate a captured U.S. servicemember. (Tr. 48-49) Applicant took great 
pride in his assistance to U.S. forces, and in his role in fighting terrorists and the deaths 
and capture of terrorists in Iraq. (Tr. 49-50, 195) Applicant was under direct fire while 
serving in Iraq. (Tr. 50) After he was almost shot during a mission, the Marine Corps 
battalion commander permitted Applicant to be armed. (Tr. 51) He wore a Marine Corps 
uniform while in the field supporting his Marine Corps unit. (Tr. 51) Applicant was 
deployed to Fallujah during the battle in 2004. (Tr. 51)  
 
Applicant had a good reputation as a linguist, and the FBI and CIA requested his 
assistance on many occasions. (Tr. 51-52) On June 12, 2006, Applicant returned to the 
United States from Southwest Asia. (Tr. 52)      
 
Applicant currently owns a restaurant in the United States. (Tr. 42) He is married 
and has two children. (Tr. 41) His children are U.S. citizens and live in the United 
States. 
 
Link to a known terrorist organization in Pakistan 
 
An experienced counter-intelligence FBI special agent reviewed a classified 
document, relating to a closed FBI investigation, and provided an unclassified letterhead 
memorandum which states, “FBI investigation has determined a possible contact 
between [Applicant] and an entity in Pakistan which has been linked to a known terrorist 
organization.” (Tr. 171-75; GE 3) The quoted sentence was part of the classified 
investigative report, and was not generated in response to DOHA’s request for 
information about Applicant. (Tr. 172-73) The FBI “associated” Applicant’s phone 
number with an entity in Pakistan. (Tr. 178, 188) The association was through 
Applicant’s telephone subscriber account. (Tr. 181-82) The FBI special agent was not 
aware of when the investigation was conducted; however, he believed “it’s probably 
about eight years old, eight to ten years old.” (Tr. 180, 182) “[I]t was in the 2000s.” (Tr. 
182) He was not aware who made the telephone call, and he did not know whether 
Applicant was in the location to use his telephone when the call was made. (Tr. 183, 
188) A source mentioned Applicant’s name, and what may have happened is they 
checked Applicant’s subscriber account. (Tr. 184-86) The FBI investigation containing 
the reference to Applicant was not directed towards Applicant’s activities. (Tr. 185) 
Applicant was merely a reference in the unrelated investigation. (Tr. 185) Applicant’s 
phone calls were not monitored. (Tr. 188) Applicant’s phone number and service 
provider were not listed in the classified FBI summary. (Tr. 186) The FBI has no 
investigative report on Applicant, and declined to search the other investigative case file 
to determine when the call was made, the number called from, or the name of the 
 
3His father recently retired from driving limousines. (Tr. 96) 
 
6 
                                                                                                                                              
                                           
subscriber. (Tr. 187) In sum, anyone who had access to the phone that called Pakistan 
could have made the call. (Tr. 188)   
  
Applicant denied any contact with anyone in Pakistan. (Tr. 53, 99, 195; SOR ¶ 
1.a) He suggested that if there was contact with an entity in Pakistan, the person who 
called was Applicant’s son, who has the same name as Applicant. (Tr. 54; AE M) 
Applicant’s son was born in 1984 in state N where the phone call was probably made to 
Pakistan. In 2002 and in 2003, until he was deployed to Hungary, Applicant and his son 
lived in the same household in state N. (Tr. 191-92) His son was 18 or 19 years old at 
that time. (AE M) Applicant was not aware that his son had any Pakistani friends at that 
time. (Tr. 194)  
 
Applicant’s 26-year-old son has bipolar disorder and does not take his 
medications. (Tr. 55) His son is a drug abuser. (Tr. 54) His son has Pakistani friends. 
(Tr. 54, 60) Applicant’s first spouse was a Catholic, and his son was raised as a 
Catholic. (Tr. 55) His son converted to the Muslim religion. (Tr. 56) Applicant learned his 
son had become a radical Muslim, who referred to Christians, including his mother and 
sister, as infidels. (Tr. 56-57) Applicant’s son told Applicant he “would feel much happier 
if my sister and my mom were dead. And he said, I will do it myself because they’re 
infidels, anyway.” (Tr. 57) Applicant’s first wife obtained a restraining order against her 
son. (Tr. 57) In November 2009, Applicant notified the FBI of his concerns about his 
son. (Tr. 57-60, 93; AE T) Applicant provided a document to the FBI, and FBI agents 
came to Applicant’s restaurant and interviewed him. (Tr. 61)4 Applicant’s son said he 
planned to go to Iraq and join the fight against the United States, including against his 
cousin, who is a U.S. Marine, serving in Iraq. (Tr. 59)  
 
Applicant’s son and his parents currently live in state N. (Tr. 55, 94) Applicant left 
state N in 2002. (Tr. 96) In January 2010, Applicant’s son was indicted for stalking, 
threatening a witness, and contempt of court, and in October 2010, he pleaded guilty to 
obstructing government operations/contempt of court by sending a witness a telephonic 
text message. (AE M)    
 
Applicant said it was tough to inform the FBI about his own son; however, 
“national security is extremely important” to him. (Tr. 93) He argued that he has proven 
his integrity during his service overseas for the Marines, CIA and other U.S. 
Government agencies. (Tr. 92-93)  
 
Foreign influence concerns and Syria 
 
Applicant’s 32-year-old spouse was born in the United States. (Tr. 62, 98, 154) 
When she was three years old, her father passed away, and she and her mother 
returned to Syria. (Tr. 102, 149) Her mother passed away when Applicant’s spouse was 
17 years old. (Tr. 150) She lived in Syria until she was 19 years old, when she returned 
to the United States. (Tr. 103, 149) Her Syrian passport expired in the 1990s. (Tr. 103) 
From 2003 to the present, she has been employed as a linguist for a DoD contractor. 
 
4The FBI agents declined to make statements at Applicant’s hearing and to provide written 
statements about Applicant’s disclosures to them. (Tr. 165; AE T) 
 
7 
                                                                                                                                              
(Tr. 152-53) In 2004, she received a Secret clearance, and in August 2008, she 
received a Top Secret clearance. (Tr. 63, 153) Applicant and his spouse met in Kuwait, 
while pending deployment to Iraq. (Tr. 103-04)  
 
Applicant’s spouse’s parents were born in Syria, and they are naturalized U.S. 
citizens. (Tr. 62, 98, 150-51) Applicant did not believe his spouse had dual citizenship 
with Syria. (Tr. 102) She does not have any siblings. (Tr. 63)  
 
Applicant’s spouse has two aunts and three uncles on her mother’s side of the 
family, and one uncle and three aunts on her father’s side of the family. (Tr. 151) All of 
her aunts and uncles live in Syria. (Tr. 63, 151; SOR ¶ 1.c) Her aunts have no 
relationship to the Syrian Government. (Tr. 143-44) She contacts them or they contact 
her about three or four times a year. (Tr. 104-05, 143, 155) She is not very close to her 
other aunts. (Tr. 105) Applicant and his spouse were visited by her aunts, when they 
were in Syria in 2007. (Tr. 106) After leaving Syria when she was 19, she has been to 
Syria once in 1999 (when she was 20) and once in 2007. (Tr. 109, 154) She is close to 
her cousin, who is a U.S. citizen and lives in the United States. (Tr. 155) She 
communicates with her cousin on a weekly basis. (Tr. 155) 
 
Applicant might communicate with his spouse’s aunts once or twice a year to say 
hello or happy holidays, when they call to speak to Applicant’s spouse. (Tr. 64) The last 
time Applicant talked to anyone in Syria on the telephone was about two years ago. (Tr. 
141, 156) Applicant and his spouse went to Syria in 2007 for their honeymoon. (Tr. 64, 
153) They stayed for 26 days in two Syrian hotels. (Tr. 65, 107) When Syrians ask 
about his employment, he tells them that he works in the hotel management industry. 
(Tr. 107-08)  
 
Syria 
 
Syria borders on Iraq, Israel, Syria, Turkey, and Lebanon. Syria is approximately 
the same size as North Dakota. Syria’s population in 2009 is estimated to be about 21 
million people. 
 
Officially Syria is a republic; however, in reality it is ruled by an authoritarian 
regime. Syria is included on the U.S. State Department's List of State Sponsors of 
Terrorism. There are several known terrorist groups in Syria. The Syrian Government 
continues to provide political and material support to Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist 
groups. Several terrorist groups maintain their offices and some of their leadership in 
Syria. In addition, the Syrian Government permits Iran to transfer weapons and supplies 
through Syria to assist terrorists in Lebanon. Syria is one of the main transit points for 
foreign fighters entering Iraq. A travel warning for Syria warns about the risks of 
terrorism due to the September 2006 attack on the U.S. embassy in Damascus. Syrian 
forces killed the four individuals who attacked the U.S. embassy in 2006. There have 
been other attacks on the U.S. Ambassador's residence and the U.S. embassy in 1998 
and 2000.

The United States instituted economic sanctions against Syria due to their active 
and passive support of terrorism in the Middle East. No commercial aircraft owned or 
operated by the Syrian Government may take off or land in the United States. There are 
human rights abuses in Syria that include: systematic repression of Syrian citizens’ 
ability to peacefully change the government; arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life; 
torture and physical abuse of prisoners and detainees; arbitrary arrests and detentions; 
restrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association; government 
corruption; and violence and discrimination against women. Torture is occasionally 
used, including against foreign citizens. Security personnel have placed foreign visitors 
under surveillance, have monitored telephones, and have searched hotel rooms and 
possessions of foreign citizens.  
 
 Syria opposed the Iraq war in 2003, and foreign relations between Syria and the 
United States deteriorated. In 2005, the United States withdrew its ambassador to Syria 
after the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri.   
 
Personal Conduct 
 
In 1989, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). 
(Tr. 65; SOR ¶ 2.a; GE 4 at 7-8) His blood alcohol content was .14. (Tr. 110; GE 4 at 8) 
Applicant pleaded guilty, received a $250 fine, and six months of probation with 
suspended license. (Tr. 65-66, 110-11; GE 4 at 8) He received alcohol counseling, and 
he completed his sentence. (Tr. 65-66, 110-11) He did not have any subsequent 
alcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 66) He consumes moderate amounts of alcohol, and does 
not drink alcohol before driving. (Tr. 109; GE 4 at 8) 
 
In 1992, Applicant discovered that his fiancée was seeing another man. (Tr. 67, 
112) He demanded that she return the engagement ring he gave her. (Tr. 67, 112; GE 4 
at 7) He was devastated that she would cheat on him. (Tr. 116) There was an 
unpleasant argument. (Tr. 112) He said he would “do what it takes to get it back.” (Tr. 
113) She perceived his statement as a threat because of the angry tone of his voice. 
(Tr. 113) She obtained a restraining order against Applicant. (Tr. 66, 111; SOR ¶ 2.b; 
GE 4 at 5) He went to her door and knocked on it; however, he denied that he damaged 
her door by kicking it. (Tr. 114, 117-18; GE 4) She accused him of damage to property, 
obstructing a court order, and harassing communication, and the police arrested 
Applicant. (Tr. 67, 113-14; SOR ¶ 2.c) He did not assault her and there was no mutual 
affray. (Tr. 112) Applicant said he was not arrested. (Tr. 68) He learned about the arrest 
warrant and turned himself in to authorities. (Tr. 68, 117) He said her allegations were 
false, she withdrew her support for the charges before trial, and the charges were 
dismissed. (Tr. 67)  
 
Defrauding a bank 
   
A January 11, 1995 preliminary police report indicated on December 22, 1994, 
Applicant placed three empty deposit envelopes marked with $120, $120, and $50 in a 
bank in state F, and then withdrew $100 from his account, which had a negative 
 
9 
                                                                                                                                              
                                           
balance. (GE 4 at 8-9; GE 8)5 The report was in “default” status and was supposed to 
be followed up with fingerprinting of the deposit envelopes. (GE 8) The offense is listed 
as “Fraud-false ID/impersonat” and “petit theft.” (GE 8) The bank provided videotapes of 
the fraudulent deposits to the police. (GE 8) The police report states, “[Applicant] 
advised that he deposited $120. He than made a withdrawal of $60. At 1812 hrs, he 
returned to the bank and placed a blank envelope into the drop off box advising that he 
was depositing another $120. He than made a withdrawal for $40. At 1814 hrs, he 
deposited an envelope into the drop off box advising that he deposited $50.” (GE 8 at 4) 
 
The police report does not indicate whether or not Applicant was arrested. (GE 8) 
Applicant denied that he attempted to defraud the bank, and asserted he was probably 
away at sea, working for a cruise ship when the offenses were committed. (Tr. 129-31) 
He denied that he was ever in city B in 1995, where the offense occurred. (GE 4 at 8-9)6 
However, Applicant’s May 14, 2007 OPM PSI indicates he lived in city B where the 
offense occurred in 1997-1998 and was employed at “P[]’s restaurant,” which is located 
in city B (GE 2 at 9) The 1995 police report indicates Applicant is employed at “P[]’s 
restaurant,” which is located in city B. (Compare GE 2 at 9 with GE 8 at 2) Applicant 
recently contacted the police department in city B, where the report originated and was 
advised they had no record of the incident. (Tr. 131)  
 
Applicant’s October 8, 2004 SF-86 indicates he worked at “P[]’s restaurant” from 
March 1997 to June 1998. (GE 13) He worked at a cruise line in a different city in the 
state F from January to September 1995. (GE 13) From September 1995 to March 
1997, he worked in a restaurant in state N. (GE 13) Applicant’s October 8, 2004 SF-86 
did not indicate he ever lived in state F. (GE 13) 
 
Applicant addressed the non-SOR allegation that in 1998, Applicant wrote a bad 
check in Florida. (GE 4 at 1-2) The creditor provided a statement that there was no 
record of Applicant having a returned check. (AE U) 
 
 
 
 
5The SOR did not allege that Applicant committed the 1995 theft from a bank. In ISCR Case No. 
03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not 
alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). I have not considered this non-SOR allegation because it is not substantiated. I have not 
considered any of the other non-SOR allegations discussed in this decision for any purpose that 
negatively reflects on Applicant’s worthiness to hold a security clearance.  
 
6Of course, the offense occurred in 1994, and the police report does not indicate when Applicant 
was interviewed.  
 
10 
                                                                                                                                              
Involvement with prostitutes overseas from 2003 to 2005 
 
From 2003 to 2005, Applicant had sexual encounters with prostitutes on 
approximately 15 occasions in two foreign countries. (Tr. 73-75, 132; SOR ¶ 2.e; GE 4 
at 25) Applicant’s September 9, 2008 sworn statement to an OPM investigator 
discussed his involvement with prostitutes in two Southwest Asia countries: 
 
Q: How do you reconcile your relationship with your wife (girlfriend at the 
time) and your solicitation of prostitutes at the same time? 
A: I was dating my wife during the last trip to [two Southwest Asian 
countries in November 2004], but she was not with me in the country. I felt 
very guilty after, however, it really hit me when she arrived and she told 
me that she missed me. I then made a vow never to do it again and to 
prove it to myself that I would be more devoted to her, I proposed to her 
on 3 Apr 2005. I have never cheated on my wife since. 
 
Q: Does your wife now know of your conduct at the time? 
A: She knows of the [encounters with prostitutes prior to their dating 
relationship], however [she] has no knowledge of the instances that 
took place while we were dating. 
 
Q: What would occur if your wife found out about these encounters? 
A: She would be heartbroken. She would be extremely hurt. I don’t think 
she would leave me but it would take a lot to mend the hurt. 
 
Q: Can you be blackmailed with this information? 
A: No. I would inform my wife of my actions rather than being blackmailed 
to commit any acts against national security.  (emphasis added) GE 4 at 
page 26 of 33 pages.  
  
Applicant began dating his future wife on January 11, 2004. (Tr. 134, 157) At his 
hearing, he insisted the sexual encounters with prostitutes occurred before he started 
dating his future spouse. (Tr. 75; 134; 139-41) He said he may have encountered or 
talked to prostitutes after January 11, 2004, because prostitutes frequent the same 
clubs and hotels as DoD contractors in two Southwest Asia countries. (Tr. 76-77, 132; 
GE 4 at 25) Applicant denied that he had sexual contact with any of the prostitutes after 
January 11, 2004 (Tr. 76-77, 132-134, 139-41). Applicant was confronted with his 
September 9, 2008 sworn statement, and Applicant responded: 
 
I didn’t tell [the OPM investigator] I slept with prostitutes on every single 
trip from 2003, 2004, and 2005. This is absolutely not true, sir. I did not 
sleep with any women period, never mind prostitutes, ever since I 
met my wife on January 11th 2004. I just want to make that clear. I have 
no reason to sleep with any prostitutes. I am married to a wonderful lady, 
a very great lady. I had no reason to even look further after I met her. 
(emphasis added) (Tr. 134)

*  *  * 
 
Q:  .  .  . [Your September 2008 statement indicates] “During these stays, I 
met with prostitutes. During each of the trips to [two Southwest Asia 
countries], I solicited prostitutes about four times .  .  . “ 
A: That’s correct.  
 
Q: “I was single with no commitments at the time.” 
A: That’s correct. 
   
Q: [Your September 2008 statement continued,] “About a year later, 
November of ’04, I was deployed [and went to two Southwest Asia 
countries for R&R].  
A: Yes. 
 
Q: “During both trips, I met with prostitutes.” 
A: That is correct. 
 
Q: All right. What is the difference between soliciting and meeting? 
A: I mean, when I went to [two Southwest Asia countries], I specifically 
went there to meet with and sleep with prostitutes. This is the main reason 
why I used to go. But after I met my wife, I continued to go to [two 
Southwest Asia countries] with other friends, but never slept with 
prostitutes. I just met with them because they are almost impossible to 
avoid. They are everywhere. (emphasis added) (Tr. 140-41) 
 
Applicant and his spouse agreed that he disclosed to his spouse his sexual 
contacts with prostitutes before their dating relationship. (Tr. 78, 159-62) 
 
Threats to site manager in 2004 
 
On February 25, 2004, Applicant’s site manager and a Human Relations (HR) 
Assistant Manager accused Applicant of calling the site manager on February 26, 2004, 
and stating Applicant would, “kick your ass,” “you’re a liar,” and “you better not let me 
see you. I’ll do something bad to you.” (Tr. 79, 135; GE 11, GE 12, AE R) Applicant 
explained that the site manager called Applicant “a moron and stuff.” (Tr. 80) Applicant 
denied the site manager’s allegations about Applicant threatening to kick the site 
manager’s ass, and promising to do something bad to him. (Tr. 135) Applicant’s site 
manager and the HR Assistant Manager said Applicant was upset that he was being 
transferred from his present unit to Baghdad. (GE 11, 12)  
 
At his hearing, Applicant said that in January 2004, a new site manager in Iraq 
“made a pass at [Applicant’s future spouse’s] breasts.” (Tr. 79, 135) Applicant said he 
told the site manager to stay away from his girlfriend, otherwise he would report the site 
manager to the company. (Tr. 136) (As indicated previously on page 10, Applicant said 
his first date with his future spouse was on January 11, 2004.) On January 25, 2004, 
Applicant received a written counseling for insubordination and assault from the site 
 
12 
                                                                                                                                              
manager. (Tr. 81; SOR ¶ 2.f; GE 9) The January 25, 2004 counseling, which was 
witnessed by the HR Assistant Manager, stated that Applicant admitted that he 
requested a transfer to Baghdad, and then told members of his unit he was being forced 
to go to Baghdad by the site manager. (GE 9, 10)  
 
The site manager’s MFR recommended to the site manager’s company that 
Applicant be processed for termination based on his threatening and unprofessional 
behavior as well as Applicant’s opposition to the transfer. (Tr. 81; SOR ¶ 2.g; GE 9, 11) 
However, Applicant’s employer, which was a subcontractor of the site manager’s 
company, doubted the credibility of the site manager’s allegations, and rejected any 
disciplinary action. (Tr. 82; AE R) Applicant stayed in country, and the site manager was 
transferred out of country. (Tr. 83) Applicant left employment with the contractor in June 
2004. (AE Q) He provided a March 8, 2006 email from his employer asking Applicant to 
return to work for the company. (AE P) An October 26, 2009 email from his employer in 
2004 indicates their records show Applicant resigned from his employment; however, he 
is “eligible for rehire.” (AE Q)  
    
Falsification of 2004 security clearance application (SF-86) 
 
On October 8, 2004, Applicant completed an SF-86, which asked one question 
about his alcohol-related offenses, and one question about serious criminal offenses: 
“Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or 
drugs?” and “In the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted 
of any offense(s) not [previously] listed? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless 
the violation was alcohol or drug related.)” Applicant responded, “No” to both questions. 
He failed to disclose his DUI in 1989 and his arrest for impersonating a police officer in 
2002. (SOR ¶¶ 2.h and 2.i; Tr. 85-86, 136)  
 
Applicant explained that he failed to provide accurate information because he 
rushed through completion of the 2004 SF-86. (Tr. 85-86) This was his first SF-86, and 
he thought he was supposed to list offenses in the last seven years. (Tr. 87, 137-38) He 
disclosed the DUI to counterintelligence before his first deployment to Iraq about the 
same time he completed the SF-86. (Tr. 138) He also thought he did not have to list 
offenses with fines of less than $150, and therefore he failed to list the arrest for 
impersonating a police officer. (Tr. 89-90; GE 4 at 4-5) 
 
In 2006, Applicant completed his SF-86. The facility security officer (FSO) told 
everyone that that was completing their SF-86 to be sure and list all drug and alcohol-
related offenses, and that there was no time limit. (Tr. 88) He disclosed the 1989 DUI. 
(Tr. 88; GE 1) He also disclosed the disorderly conduct charge because his FSO said it 
should be disclosed. (Tr. 90-91; GE 1) 
 
Misuse of badge and a unit coin 
 
Applicant donated money to the police department in state N, and he received a 
badge indicating “Honor Legion Police Department.” (Tr. 70-71, 119-20) Applicant glued 
the badge inside his wallet, hoping that if the police in state N stopped him for a traffic 
 
13 
                                                                                                                                              
violation they would notice the badge and let him out of a traffic ticket. (GE 4 at 3, 31) In 
December 2002, Applicant and several linguists learned they were selected for a DoD 
program and were celebrating their assignments at a restaurant in state V. (Tr. 69) After 
eating in the restaurant, they were waiting for a cab. (Tr. 70, 118-19) The bouncer told 
them to wait outside; however, Applicant objected because it was cold outside. (Tr. 70, 
119) Applicant took the cab driver’s card out of his wallet to show the card to the 
bouncer. (Tr. 120) When he opened his wallet, the bouncer evidently saw the badge for 
the Honor Legion Police Department. Applicant was arrested later that evening for 
impersonating a police officer. (Tr. 69-72, 118, 120; SOR ¶ 1.d; GE 4 at 3-5)  
 
When Applicant went to court, the judge dismissed the impersonating police 
officer offense, and he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid a $73 fine. (Tr. 69, 
72, 121) The reason he pleaded guilty to the disorderly conduct offense was because 
he did not want to miss his deployment, and he did not want to hire a lawyer to contest 
the offense. (Tr. 73) He denied that his conduct was disorderly. (Tr. 73)  
 
Applicant bought a coin with a badge on it from an Air Force base exchange 
(BX). (Tr. 124; GE 4 at 5, 32) The unit coin was for the unit Applicant was supporting as 
a contractor. (Tr. 125; GE 4 at 5) The BX sells the item with glue so that it can be placed 
in one’s wallet. (Tr. 124) He purchased the item because he was proud of his 
association with the unit. (Tr. 125; GE 4 at 32) Most of the contractors he knew had the 
same type of unit coin in their wallets. (Tr. 125) Applicant volunteered to an OPM 
investigator during his personal subject interview (PSI) that in 2005, an inspector 
general officer (IG) noticed that Applicant had this item glued into the inside front of his 
wallet when he went into a club overseas. (Tr. 122-24; GE 4 at 5) Applicant was 
accused by another contractor of using the coin to obtain privileges from hotels or bars 
in Southwest Asian countries. Applicant got rid of the unit coin after the IG noticed it. 
(Tr. 125) Misuse of the unit coin was not listed as an SOR allegation, and is not 
substantiated as an offense. See n. 5, supra.   
 
Character Evidence 
 
A senior executive employed by a U.S. intelligence agency, who served with 
Applicant and his spouse in Southwest Asia, described Applicant as talented, hard 
working, well-liked, and patriotic. (AE A) Applicant has a positive attitude towards his 
service in support of missions, and expressed a sincere debt of gratitude to the United 
States for helping his family. (AE A)  
 
A DoD field counterintelligence specialist, who served with Applicant in 
Southwest Asia from May 2003 to March 2004 and has known him for more than seven 
years, lauded Applicant’s contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B) He 
emphasized Applicant’s hard work, dedication, trustworthiness, and professionalism. 
(AE B) Applicant was his team’s “top selection” among the linguists available for their 
missions. (AE B) Two U.S. Army captains, who served with Applicant in Southwest Asia 
in 2003-2004, made similar positive statements about Applicant’s dedication and 
professionalism. (AE E, J)   
 
 
14 
                                                                                                                                              
                                           
Applicant received certificates of appreciation or commendation in 2003, 2004, 
2006, and 2008 for his contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE C, D, G, K, L) 
These certificates cite his professionalism, dedication, initiative, and loyalty. Id. He 
received a letter of appreciation in 2003 for his “superb assistance” on a mission for a 
U.S. Marine Corps Expeditionary Unit serving in Southwest Asia. (AE F)   
 
Applicant’s award of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal was signed 
by the Secretary of the Navy on May 6, 2003. (AE H) This award notes in part: 
 
[Applicant] spent many long, arduous hours translating during the 
meetings of senior officers and key Iraqi officials, assisting in 
interrogations of enemy prisoners of war, and debriefing civilians ranging 
from Saddam Hussein’s senior leaders to common people on the street. 
He worked tirelessly, often without sleep and under direct enemy fire. 
Interrogations that he helped to conduct resulted in information that helped 
[his Marine Corps battalion] capture key enemy facilities, paramilitary 
leaders and weapons caches. During the entire operation, he showed 
unyielding courage and dedication to his country and his fellow citizens. 
[Applicant] brings great credit upon himself and the United States of 
America.   (AE H) 
 
A May 5, 2003, letter of appreciation from a Marine Corps counterintelligence 
element described Applicant’s extraordinary efforts on behalf of the U.S. war effort 
stating: 
 
[Applicant provided] critical information [though his interrogations of Iraqi 
personnel] leading to the rescue of an American Prisoner of War,[7] the 
capture of over 25 enemy paramilitary officers, countless weapons caches 
and the capture of the first enemy headquarters facility taken during the 
war. [He] was pivotal in his role as a linguist, not only translating secret 
enemy documents and conducting simultaneous interpretation for 
countless meetings, debriefings and interrogations, but doing all of that for 
over six weeks on an average of three hours [of] rest per day and often 
under direct enemy fire. (AE I) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
 
7The identity of the American POW is restricted. (Tr. 48-49; GE 4 at 29) 
  
 
15 
                                                                                                                                              
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
The DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly stated: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance 
of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. 
“The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole 
person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them 
apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their application requires the

Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). The DOHA 
Appeal Board may reverse the administrative judge’s “decision to grant, deny, or revoke 
a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.” ISCR Case No. 07-
16511 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) (citing Directive ¶¶ E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.).8 The 
federal courts generally limit appeals to whether or not the agency complied with its own 
regulations.   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guidelines B (foreign influence) and E (personal conduct). 
 
Foreign Influence 
 
  AG ¶ 6 explains the security concern about “foreign contacts and interests” 
stating: 
 
Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual 
has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or 
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a 
way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by 
any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should 
consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such 
considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United 
States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a 
risk of terrorism. 
 
AG ¶ 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: 
 
 
8See ISCR Case No. 09-03773 at 7 n. 4-6 (A.J. Jan. 29, 2010)(discussing appellate standards of 
review). 
 
 
17 
                                                                                                                                              
(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional 
associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a 
foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign 
exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  
 
(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that 
create a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation to 
protect sensitive information or technology and the individual’s desire to 
help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  
 
(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of 
citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign 
inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. 
 
The allegation that Applicant had “possible contact” with “an entity in Pakistan 
which has been linked to a known terrorist organization” (SOR ¶ 1.a) is refuted. The FBI 
did not provide the date of the possible contact, or the telephone number used to call 
the Pakistani entity. Applicant may not have been in state N when the call was made to 
Pakistan. Applicant denied making any contacts with anyone in Pakistan. Applicant’s 
son has a criminal record and is mentally unstable. His son has adopted jihad, stated he 
wants to attack the United States, and he has threatened Applicant’s former spouse 
because she is a Christian. Applicant’s son or one of Applicant’s son’s friends may have 
used Applicant’s telephone to call the entity in Pakistan associated with terrorism. It is 
telling that the FBI never interviewed Applicant about the call to Pakistan, or made other 
investigative efforts to verify the contact. Applicant’s honorable and brave service in Iraq 
on behalf of the Marine Corps and a DoD intelligence service is inconsistent with 
allegiance to a known terrorist organization. In sum, there is insufficient evidence that 
Applicant contacted a Pakistani entity, and this allegation is resolved for Applicant.    
 
AG ¶¶ 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply to Applicant’s spouse’s connection to Syria. 
Applicant’s spouse was born in the United States, and then she lived in Syria from age 
3 to 19. She has five aunts and four uncles who currently live in Syria. She 
communicates with some of them three or four times per year. She traveled to Syria in 
1999 and 2007. Applicant shares living quarters with his spouse. He and his spouse 
visited Syria in 2007, where they went for their honeymoon.    
 
Applicant’s spouse has a sufficient relationship with her aunts and uncles 
because of communications and visits to raise a security concern. “[T]here is a 
rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the 
immediate family members of the person’s spouse.” ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 
DOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Although aunts and uncles are not 
immediate family members, his spouse has a sufficient emotional connection with one 
or more of her Syrian aunts and uncles to establish a security concern. Applicant’s 
relationship with his spouse, and through her with her aunts and uncles creates “a 
heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion” 
because of Syria’s “disregard for human rights, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its 
 
18 
                                                                                                                                              
antipathy to U.S. regional Interests” See ISCR Case No. 09-03114 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 
22, 2010) (discussing insufficient mitigation because of Syria’s internal circumstances). 
 
Similarly, Applicant and his spouse’s relationships with one or more of her aunts 
and uncles living in Syria create a potential conflict of interest between Applicant’s 
“obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help” any of 
her family members who are in Syria. For example, if terrorists or the Syrian 
Government wanted to expose Applicant to coercion, they could exert pressure on his 
spouse’s aunts and uncles.  
 
The mere possession of close family ties with a family member living in Syria is 
not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or their 
spouse has a close relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this 
factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially 
result in the compromise of classified information. See generally ISCR Case No. 03-
02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  
 
The nature of a nation’s government, its relationship with the United States, and 
its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant’s family 
members are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, 
persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian 
government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or 
the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United 
States. The relationship of Syria with the United States places a significant, but not 
insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his spouse’s 
relationships with her family members living in Syria do not pose a security risk. 
Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose 
between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist one of his spouse’s aunts or 
uncles living in Syria, who might be coerced by the Syrian Government or terrorists 
operating in Syria.  
 
Guideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. “The United 
States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information 
from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, 
regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to 
those of the United States.” ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). 
Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States 
over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, 
we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, 
especially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 
2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  
 
While there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Syria or terrorists 
seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his 
spouse, or her relatives living in Syria, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in 
the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities, and 
Syria has a problem with terrorism. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence 
 
19 
                                                                                                                                              
of Applicant’s spouse’s contacts with one or more of her aunts or uncles living in Syria 
and has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG ¶¶ 
7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of 
any mitigating conditions.  
 
AG ¶ 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns 
including: 
 
(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in 
which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those 
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be 
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign 
individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the 
U.S.; 
 
(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual’s sense of 
loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country 
is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding 
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected 
to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; 
  
(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and 
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign 
influence or exploitation; 
 
(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or 
are approved by the cognizant security authority; 
 
(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency 
requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from 
persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and 
 
(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property 
interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not 
be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. 
    
AG ¶¶ 8(a) and 8(c) have limited applicability. Applicant visited Syria in 2007, 
which is recent. Applicant’s spouse has frequent contact with her relatives in Syria. See 
generally ISCR Case No. 09-03114 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010) (holding 
communications once a month were sufficient to be frequent). However, because of his 
connections to his spouse, and her connections to relatives in Syria, Applicant is not 
able to fully meet his burden of showing there is “little likelihood that [his relationships 
with his relatives who are Syria citizens] could create a risk for foreign influence or 
exploitation.”    
 
AG ¶ 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG ¶ 8(b) analysis is Applicant’s “deep 
and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.” Applicant has strong family 
 
20 
                                                                                                                                              
connections to the United States. His spouse and two children are U.S. citizens. His 
spouse has a Top Secret DoD-issued security clearance and is a linguist. Applicant and 
his spouse have served as linguists in Southwest Asia in a combat zone. Applicant’s 
service is especially noteworthy and includes exposure to direct enemy fire on multiple 
occasions in Iraq. 
 
Applicant’s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the 
potential conflict of interest created by his relationship with his spouse, and her 
relationships with her aunts and uncles living in Syria. There is no evidence that 
terrorists, criminals, the Syrian Government, or those conducting espionage have 
approached or threatened Applicant, his spouse, or her family in Syria to coerce 
Applicant or his spouse for classified or sensitive information. As such, there is a 
reduced possibility that Applicant, Applicant’s spouse, or Applicant’s spouse’s aunts and 
uncles living in Syria would be specifically selected as targets for improper coercion or 
exploitation. While the U.S. Government does not have any burden to prove the 
presence of such evidence, if such record evidence was present, Applicant would have 
a heavy evidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns. 
It is important to be mindful of the United States’ contentious relationship with Syria, and 
especially Syria’s support for terrorist groups and systematic human rights violations. 
Syria’s conduct makes it more likely that Syria would coerce Applicant through his 
spouse’s family, if Syria determined it was advantageous to do so. The fact that 
Applicant’s spouse’s family members living in Syria are unaware that he or his spouse 
has U.S. Government-related employment or that they hold security clearances reduces 
the risk that Applicant will be coerced through his spouse’s family living in Syria; 
however, the risk is still substantial. Syrian intelligence agents and terrorists might learn 
that Applicant or his spouse has a clearance through means other than his family living 
in Syria.     
 
AG ¶¶ 8(d) and 8(e) do not apply. The U.S. Government has not encouraged 
Applicant or his spouse’s involvement with her family members living in Syria. Applicant 
is not required to report his contacts with his spouse’s family members living in Syria. 
 
AG ¶ 8(f) does not apply because it is only available to mitigate concerns raised 
by property interests in Syria under AG ¶ 7(e). Applicant and his spouse do not have 
any property interests or investments in Syria.  
 
In sum, the primary foreign influence security concern is Applicant’s spouse’s 
relationships with her aunts and uncles living in Syria. These relatives live in Syria and 
are readily available for coercion. The Syrian Government’s antipathy towards the 
United States and failure to follow the rule of law further increase the risk of coercion. 
However, Applicant and his spouse have made extraordinary contributions to the United 
States war effort as linguists in Southwest Asia. Those contributions demonstrate their 
“deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,” and I am confident that 
Applicant will “resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.” See AG ¶ 
8(b).  
 
 
 
21 
                                                                                                                                              
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
AG ¶ 16 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying with respect to the SOR allegations in this case: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning 
relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent 
medical authority, or other official government representative;  
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply 
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the 
person may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes 
but is not limited to consideration of:  .  .  . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or 
rule violations; and 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such 
as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing. 
 
There is sufficient evidence to apply AG ¶¶ 16(a), 16(b), 16(d), and 16(e). When 
Applicant completed his 2004 SF-86, he did not disclose his 1989 DUI, and he did not 
disclose his 2002 arrest for impersonating an officer. There is also substantial evidence 
that he violated a restraining order in 1992, had sexual encounters with prostitutes in 
two Southwest Asia countries in 2003 and 2004, committed the 1989 DUI, engaged in 
the disorderly conduct in 2002, and threatened bodily harm to his supervisor in 
Southwest Asia in 2004. His behavior violates multiple statutes and rules.  
  
 
22 
                                                                                                                                              
Certainly, such crimes and rule violations violate important civil and criminal rules 
in our society, and these offenses are conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it 
adversely affects a person’s professional and community standing.  Thus, AG ¶ 16(e)(1) 
applies and further inquiry concerning the applicability of mitigating conditions is 
required.  
 
 
AG ¶ 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; 
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or 
occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules 
and regulations. 
  
AG ¶ 17(f) applies to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.f to 2.i. As to the allegations in 
SOR ¶¶ 2.f and 2.g, Applicant denied that he threatened his site manager with bodily 
injury. He attributed the site manager’s allegations to Applicant’s threat to tell his site 
manager’s supervisor about the site manager’s inappropriate sexual advances towards 
his future spouse. Applicant’s company doubted the credibility of the site manager’s 
allegation, and Applicant did not receive any disciplinary action. 
 
23 
                                                                                                                                              
                                           
The allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.g and 2.h are that he failed to disclose9 derogatory 
criminal information on his 2004 SF-86. Applicant credibly denied that he intentionally 
failed to disclose his 1989 DUI and 2002 arrest for impersonating a police officer on his 
2004 SF-86. He explained that he hurried through the completion of his SF-86 and 
failed to disclose the 1989 DUI because it was more than seven years previously, and 
he did not disclose his 2002 arrest because it resulted in a $73 fine for disorderly 
conduct. In 2004, he did not consult with his security officer concerning these issues. In 
2006, Applicant’s security officer advised him that he needed to disclose all alcohol-
related offenses regardless of the passage of more than seven years, and 
misdemeanor-criminal arrests, even though the fine was less than the $150 threshold in 
the SF-86 question. Applicant complied with this advice, and disclosed both arrests on 
his 2006 SF-86. 
 
AG ¶¶ 17(c) to 17(e) apply to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a to 2.d. Applicant’s 
1989 DUI was 22 years ago, and no other alcohol-related offenses have occurred. 
Applicant’s 1992 violation of the restraining order was relatively minor and did not result 
in a conviction or physical harm to the victim. Applicant’s 2002 impersonation of a police 
officer and 2005 misuse of a unit coin are not substantiated. His 2002 disorderly 
conduct is substantiated; however, it is a relatively minor, isolated offense that resulted 
in a $73 fine. 
 
  The mitigating condition outlined in AG ¶ 17(e), “the individual has taken 
positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or 
duress” applies to all of Applicant’s offenses, except for the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.e. 
Security officials and Applicant’s spouse are well aware of the issues raised by the 
allegations in the SOR. His conduct is well-documented in law enforcement and security 
records. The federal government’s knowledge of these allegations eliminates any 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not believe Applicant would 
compromise national security to avoid public disclosure of these offenses.  
 
The allegation in SOR ¶ 2.e is not fully mitigated. Applicant’s sexual conduct with 
prostitutes in Southwest Asia remains a security concern because Applicant was 
evasive or deceptive at his hearing about his conduct with prostitutes after he began 
dating his future spouse on January 11, 2004. His September 9, 2008 statement to an 
OPM investigator was more credible than his statement at his hearing about his conduct 
 
9The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the 
burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the 
omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 
2004)). 
 
24 
                                                                                                                                              
                                           
with prostitutes after January 11, 2004. He was unwilling to be fully candid at his 
hearing about why he was ashamed of his conduct with the prostitutes, and his 
expressed rationale to the OPM investigator is the probable motive for his failure to the 
candid at his hearing. He did not want his spouse to know that he continued to engage 
in some type of sexual conduct with prostitutes after they began dating.     
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines B and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) 
were addressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
There are some facts supporting mitigation of security concerns; however, they 
are insufficient to fully mitigate all concerns. In regard to the foreign influence concerns 
raised by Applicant’s spouse’s aunts and uncles living in Syria under the whole-person 
concept, consideration must be given to the geopolitical situation in Syria, as well as the 
dangers existing in Syria.10 The danger of violence or coercion from terrorists in Syria 
and the threat of coercion from the Syrian Government make coercion and abuse more 
likely than in many other countries. Terrorists continue to threaten the interests of the 
United States, as well as those who cooperate and assist the United States. Syria has 
provided support for terrorist groups and shown some hostility towards United States 
efforts in Iraq, Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon.   
     
In 1979, Applicant immigrated to the United States. In 1990, he became a U.S. 
citizen. Applicant’s spouse and son were born and live in the United States. Applicant 
and his spouse have served with U.S. forces in Southwest Asia. Applicant significantly 
contributed to mission accomplishment of U.S. forces in Iraq. Applicant was under direct 
enemy fire on multiple occasions. Applicant and his spouse are absolutely loyal to the 
 
10 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient 
discussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion).

United States. They love the United States and consider the United States to be their 
home, and not Syria. The connections to Syria are too attenuated and limited to 
outweigh Applicant’s connections to the United States and past service to the 
Department of Defense.  
 
Applicant provided exceptionally positive character evidence. His performance as 
a linguist in 2003-2006 in Southwest Asia was truly extraordinary. His efforts under 
dangerous, arduous conditions result in important mitigation of security concerns. His 
2003 award of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal by the Secretary of the 
Navy and 2003 letter of appreciation from a Marine Corps counterintelligence element, 
quoted starting at page 14, provide a detailed description of his heroism, dedication and 
bravery. Multiple character statements and certificates of appreciation laud Applicant’s 
dependability, competence, professionalism, loyalty, and trustworthiness.  
 
Nevertheless, the circumstances tending to support revocation of his security 
clearance are too significant to be mitigated at this time under the whole-person 
concept. Applicant’s sexual conduct with prostitutes in Southwest Asia continued until 
after January 11, 2004, as indicated in his September 2008 OPM PSI. Applicant was 
evasive or deceptive at his hearing about his conduct with prostitutes after he began 
dating his future spouse on January 11, 2004. Applicant’s September 9, 2008 statement 
to an OPM investigator was more credible than his statement at his hearing about his 
conduct with prostitutes after January 11, 2004. He was unwilling to be fully candid 
about why he was ashamed of his conduct with the prostitutes because he did not want 
his spouse to know that he continued to engage is some type of sexual conduct with 
prostitutes after they began dating.     
 
After weighing all the facts and circumstances in this decision, including 
Applicant’s demeanor, sincerity, and honesty at his hearing, I conclude he has not fully 
honest or candid concerning his involvement with prostitutes in Southwest Asia after 
January 11, 2004, and SOR ¶ 2.e cannot be mitigated.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence concerns 
are mitigated; however, personal conduct concerns are not fully mitigated. For the 
reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a to 2.d: For Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.e:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 2.f to 2.i:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
