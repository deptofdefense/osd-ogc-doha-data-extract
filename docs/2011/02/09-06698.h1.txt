HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s financial problems were caused by his unemployment and 
underemployment. His statement of reasons (SOR) lists 10 debts totaling $16,745. 
Approximately $13,500 of his SOR debts relate to two student loans. Applicant paid six 
SOR debts, established a payment plan on one debt, and intends to establish a 
payment plan on one debt. He disputes two SOR debts. Applicant has a viable plan to 
resolve all SOR debts. In the last two years, he reduced his delinquent debt by about 
$7,000. Financial considerations are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 10, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of his security clearance application (SF-86) 
(GE 1). On August 20, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) 
issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. (HE 3) On October 
14, 2010, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed on Applicant’s case. 
On October 18, 2010, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to me. On November 3, 2010, 
DOHA issued a hearing notice and on November 30, 2010, Applicant’s hearing was 
held. (HE 1) At the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits (GE 1-8) (Tr. 
18), and Applicant offered 16 exhibits. (Tr. 20-26; AE A-P) There were no objections, 
and I admitted GE 1-8 and AE A-P. (Tr. 18, 26) Additionally, I admitted the hearing 
notice, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR as hearing exhibits. (HE 1-3) On 
December 7, 2010, I received the transcript. On February 24, 2011, Department 
Counsel provided 14 exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (AE Q-AD)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admits responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 
1.f. (HE 3) He denied responsibility for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i. (HE 3) His 
admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (Tr. 7) For the last 
two years, he worked as an executive assistant. (Tr. 36) In 1998, he graduated from 
high school. He is currently a sophomore in college, and he is majoring in business. (Tr. 
7-8, 54)  
 
In 1998, Applicant joined the Navy. (Tr. 28) He served in the Navy for eight years 
and was awarded the rate of Yeoman (E-4). (Tr. 8, 28-30) He was discharged from the 
Navy in June 2006 with an Honorable discharge. (Tr. 32; GE 1) He served in the Navy 
Reserve for an additional three years, until October 2009. (Tr. 41) He has never been 
married. (Tr. 34; GE 1) Applicant takes care of his 15-year-old brother. (Tr. 34) He 
currently holds a clearance at the Secret level. (Tr. 9) His SF-86 did not include any 
reportable involvement with illegal drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, or criminal 
offenses involving civilian law enforcement. (GE 1)

Financial Considerations 
 
After completing his active Navy service, Applicant was unemployed for about 
four months. (Tr. 37) He worked in a restaurant as a fry cook until July 2007. (Tr. 33, 37-
40) After July 2007, one company employed Applicant for three months, and another 
employed him for a year. (Tr. 37-38) Due to unemployment and underemployment, he 
generated delinquent debt, was evicted from an apartment, and his vehicle was 
repossessed. (Tr. 39-40) 
  
Applicant’s SOR listed 10 debts totaling $16,745. The status of his 10 SOR debts 
is as follows:  
 
1.a (education debt—$11,338)—DISPUTED AMOUNT. Applicant enrolled in a 
college, and he completed two classes. (Tr. 43; AE O at 17; AE P at 25) He was 
deployed. He informed his school, and his tuition assistance program withdrew their 
financial support because he was unable to complete some courses. (Tr. 41; AE at 5) 
Applicant disputed the amount owed on the debt. (Tr. 42) He believed that if the school 
deducted the two courses from his debt, or if the Veterans Administration reimbursed 
him for the two classes, the debt would be reduced to $4,500 to $6,200. (Tr. 43) He was 
working with the creditor to obtain a settlement. (Tr. 42)    
 
1.b (telecommunications debt—$232)—PAID. On November 10, 2010, Applicant 
paid this debt. (Tr. 43; AE I; AE O at 15, 17, 25)  
 
1.c (utility debt—$238)—PAID. On November 10, 2010, Applicant paid this debt. 
(Tr. 44; AE J, S) 
 
1.d (telecommunications debt—$327)—PAID. On April 8, 2010, Applicant settled 
this debt in full. (Tr. 45; AE D; AE O at 11, T)   
 
1.e (education debt—$2,260)—PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant’s November 2, 2010 
credit report, does not list the SOR creditor or collection agent (except as a credit 
inquiry in 2008); however, it shows several educational accounts in either deferred or 
current status, including one for $2,262. (AE O at 4-10, 20) Applicant has an established 
payment plan where he agreed to pay $340 every other month, which will result in the 
satisfaction of the debt in February 2012. (AE AA, AB)     
 
1.f (telecommunications debt—$722)—PAID. On November 22, 2010, the 
creditor wrote that the debt was paid in full. (Tr. 44, 46-47; AE K, L, O at 15, U, V, W)2 
 
 
2Applicant provided three letters from the same collection agent for a telecommunications 
creditor. The three letters are dated November 22, 2010, and have different client account numbers or 
credit reporting numbers, and all three indicate the pertinent debt is resolved. (AE K, L, M) After his 
hearing he resubmitted copies of the same three letters from the creditor. (AE U, V, W) 
 
4 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
1.g (collection debt—$488)—PAID. On February 21, 2008, Applicant’s Military 
Star debt of $581.17 was paid. (Tr. 47; AE E) Applicant contended the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.g was the Military Star debt.  
 
1.h (collection debt—$159)—DISPUTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR DEBT. 
Applicant contacted the creditor; however, the creditor was unable to determine the 
basis of the debt. (Tr. 48-49) Applicant was unable to determine his responsibility for 
this debt. (Tr. 48-49)     
 
1.i (insurance debt—$553)—PAID. On January 13, 2011, Applicant began 
making $45 monthly payments to the creditor, which was a satisfactory arrangement for 
the creditor. (Tr. 50; AE X-Z) However, in an email dated February 18, 2011, Applicant 
said the debt was settled for $445 and paid. (AE AC)    
 
1.j (collection debt—$428)—SUCCESSFULLY DISPUTED DEBT. Applicant did 
not have an account with the creditor, and he disputed the debt. (Tr. 50) It was removed 
from his credit report and did not appear on his 2009 or 2010 credit reports. (Tr. 50; AE 
O, P) 
 
In April 2010, DOHA interrogatories sought information from Applicant about 15 
delinquent debts. (AE N at 11) Applicant provided proof of payment for five of the 15 
debts and they were not included on his SOR. On March 20, 2008, he resolved a 
judgment of $625 by an apartment complex. (AE D, Q) On February 2, 2010, he paid 
$1,200 and resolved a debt relating to an apartment complex suing Applicant for 
$4,653. (AE A, B)3 On February 3, 2010, he resolved a judgment of $625 by an 
apartment complex. (AE C, R)  On March 12, 2010, he paid a creditor $98, and resolved 
a debt from November 2007. (AE G) On April 5, 2010, a medical debt for $170 was paid 
in full. (AE H) The payments on Applicant’s $15,000 car loan are $369, and the account 
is current. (AE P at 14)      
 
Applicant generated a personal financial statement. (GE 6 at 2) His monthly 
income is $3,437, his monthly expenses are $2,650, and his monthly remainder is about 
$760. (Tr. 51-53)  Applicant has not had credit counseling. (Tr. 59) On December 10, 
2010, Applicant signed an agreement with a credit counseling service, and he agreed to 
pay the service $599 on January 14, 2011. (AE AD)   
 
In sum, three SOR debts are disputed: 1.a ($11,338); 1.h ($159); and 1.j ($428)).  
Six debts were paid: 1.b ($232); 1.c ($238); 1.d ($327); 1.f ($722); 1.g ($488); and 1.i 
($553). The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for $2,260 is in a payment plan. 
 
 
 
3Applicant had three judgments against him by two apartment complexes. (Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) report of investigation (ROI) personal subject interview (PSI) on August 19, 2008; AE 
N at 3-6) Applicant was on active duty in the Navy, and his brother stayed in Applicant’s apartment 
complex while he was deployed. Id. The rent was not paid, and the apartment was damaged. Id. On 
another occasion, Applicant failed to pay one month of his rent. Id.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concerns are under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, his OPM ROI PSI, and his statement at his hearing. His debts became 
delinquent in 2006 and 2007. Applicant’s SOR listed 10 debts totaling $16,745. 
Approximately $13,500 of Applicant’s delinquent SOR debt related to two student loans. 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s conduct in resolving his debts warrants full application of AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). Applicant’s deployment while attending college classes, unemployment, and 
underemployment had a profoundly negative affect on his financial circumstances and 
caused most of the SOR debts to become delinquent. He resolved about $7,000 of 
delinquent debt in the last two years. He has paid six SOR debts and five non-SOR 
debts. He is making payments on his student loan in SOR ¶ 1.e ($2,260). He plans to 
set up a payment on his remaining student loan in SOR ¶ 1.a ($11,338) as soon as the 
issue of the amount of the debt is established. I found his promise to resolve his 
remaining, unresolved debts to be credible.4 His financial problems were generated by 
circumstances largely beyond his control. There is no evidence that he acted 
irresponsibly.    
 
Two recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 
20(a) and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the Applicant had $41,000 in delinquent 
credit card debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. 
Id. at 2. She filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her 
decision. Id. at 1-2. The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, 
had been unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former 
husband was inconsistent in his payment of child support. The Appeal Board 
determined that AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the 
 
4 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that 
Applicant’s debts were unresolved at the time the Administrative Judge’s decision was 
issued. The Appeal Board also decided that the record evidence raised the applicability 
of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of evidence5 of irresponsible behavior, poor 
judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. Id. at 4.   
  
Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an Applicant, who had been sporadically 
unemployed and lacked the ability to pay his creditors, noting that “it will be a long time 
at best before he has paid” all of his creditors. The Applicant was living on 
unemployment compensation at the time of his hearing. The Appeal Board explained 
that such a circumstance was not necessarily a bar to having access to classified 
information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required 
to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a 
serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 
(App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  The Applicant in ISCR Case 
No. 08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a 
repayment plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate 
that plan.” Id. The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because 
it did not “articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the 
Administrative Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that Applicant could or should 
have done under the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor 
financial condition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not “responsible” in light 
of his limited circumstances.” Id.   
 
Application of AG ¶ 20(c) is warranted. Although Applicant did not provide proof 
that he completed financial counseling, he has enrolled in a financial advice and 
counseling service. He also generated a personal financial statement (PFS) as part of 
his response to DOHA interrogatories. He maintains his own budget. Applicant’s 
financial situation was damaged by insufficient income as a result of unemployment and 
underemployment. His SOR lists two student loans totaling $13,500 out of a total of 
$16,745 in SOR debt. His student loans are 81% of his SOR debt. One student loan is 
in a payment plan, and the amount of the other student loan is being disputed. Once the 
amount of his disputed student loan is established, he has promised to arrange a 
payment plan to resolve it. Applicant established that he acted responsibly under the 
 
5 Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden 
to disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.

circumstances. He established contact with his creditors.6 He attempted to pay or settle, 
or attempted to establish payment plans with his creditors. His financial problem is 
being resolved or is under control. He paid six of ten SOR debts. He admitted 
responsibility for and taking reasonable and responsible actions to resolve his remaining 
SOR debts, showing some good faith and partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d).7  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not fully applicable. Applicant disputed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h 
($159) and 1.j ($428). The creditor could not find one debt and the other debt was 
removed from his credit report; however, full mitigating credit is not warranted because 
he did not provide “documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or 
provide[] evidence of actions to resolve the issue” as required in AG ¶ 20(e).   
 
In sum, Applicant fell behind on his debts because of unemployment and 
underemployment. His deployment while attending college resulted in a disputed 
student loan debt. It is unlikely that such problems will recur. He resolved about $7,000 
of delinquent debt in the last two years. He paid six SOR debts and five non-SOR debts. 
One student loan is in a payment plan, and does not appear on his current credit report 
as delinquent. One substantial student loan remains to be resolved. His efforts are 
sufficient to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Assuming, financial 
considerations concerns are not mitigated under AG ¶ 20, security concerns are 
mitigated under the whole-person concept, infra.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
 
6“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
7The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 30 years old. He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with 
his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support 
the U.S. Government as an employee of a contractor, and previously as a Sailor on 
active duty for eight years in the Navy as well as for his three-years of service in the 
Navy Reserve. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his 
employer. His security clearance application does not list any reportable incidents 
involving illegal drugs, alcohol, the police, or courts. There is no evidence that he 
abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His unemployment, underemployment, and 
deployment while in college contributed to his financial woes. I give Applicant 
substantial credit for admitting responsibility for seven of ten SOR debts. He did not 
admit full responsibility for one SOR debt because he disputed the amount of the debt, 
the creditor was unable to locate one disputed debt, and one disputed debt was deleted 
from his current credit report.   
 
All of Applicant’s SOR debts, except for two debts, are either in current status or 
disputed. Six SOR debts were paid, and five non-SOR debts were paid. I am confident 
he will keep his promise to continue resolving his student loans and avoid future 
delinquent debt. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person 
analysis in financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has ‘ . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  
 
Applicant is an intelligent person, and he understands how to budget and what 
he needs to do to establish and maintain his financial responsibility. There is simply no 
reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a “meaningful track record” of 
debt re-payment. I am confident he will keep his promise to pay his delinquent debts8 
because of his track record of financial progress shown over the last two years.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  For Applicant 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
8 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit 
reports, investigation, and additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the 
government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security context 
to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future 
revocation of a security clearance.  An administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional 
clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 WL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2000). See also ISCR Case 
No. 04-03907 at 2 (stating, “The Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary 
security clearance to allow her the opportunity to have a security clearance while she works on her 
financial problems.” and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, 2004)). This footnote 
does not imply that this Applicant’s clearance is conditional.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted.
