Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant, a naturalized U.S. citizen since 1993, failed to mitigate the security
concern caused by his possession and use of a foreign passport. Clearance is denied. 
On August 17, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guidelines C (foreign preference). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR, dated September 10, 2010, in which he admitted all
SOR allegations and requested a decision based on the record without a hearing.
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 19,
2010, which was mailed to Applicant on October 21, 2010. Applicant was notified he had
30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections thereto or any additional

information he wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on
October 26, 2010. His response to the FORM was received by DOHA on November 24,
2010. The case was assigned to me on December 15, 2010.
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 51-year-old man who has been employed continuously by a defense
contractor since February 1989. He previously worked for the same contractor from 1985
to 1988. Applicant is currently a vice president and general manager for the contractor.  
Applicant was born in Brazil in 1960. He first came to the U.S. as a tourist in 1976.
He returned to the U.S. on a student visa in 1978, and he has resided in the U.S. since.
Applicant graduated from college in the U.S. in 1982. He obtained a masters degree from
a school in the U.S. in 1984. He obtained a second masters degree from a university in the
U.S. in 1992. 
Applicant became a permanent resident U.S. alien in about 1985. He became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in October 1993, and he has possessed a U.S. passport since at
least October 2003. Applicant’s parents joined him in the United States in the 1980s. They
both became naturalized U.S. citizens in the early-1990s. Applicant’s parents are now
retired and live in the United States. Applicant does not have any siblings.
Applicant maintains dual citizenship with Brazil. Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he
has renewed his Brazilian passport in July 1997, June 2002, and February 2009. His
current Brazilian passport will not expire until February 2014. There is no indication in the
record that Applicant has ever contemplated renouncing his Brazilian citizenship. 
Applicant travels extensively throughout the world as part of his employment. He
uses his U.S. issued passport for all international travel, with the sole exception of his
travels to Brazil. Applicant explained that because he is a dual citizen with Brazil he must
use a Brazilian passport to enter that country and he is ineligible to receive a visa to enter
Brazil on his U.S. passport. His employment requires him to travel to Brazil on occasion.
He also has a few friends and relatives who reside in Brazil, who he intends to visit in the
future.
Applicant has been married to a U.S. citizen since June 1991. He and his wife have
three children, ages 18, 14, and 9. Applicant’s children are dual citizens of the U.S. and
Brazil, having acquired Brazilian citizenship at birth by virtue of Applicant’s Brazilian
citizenship. Applicant’s two oldest children possess Brazilian passports so they can travel
with Applicant to Brazil to visit friends and relatives.  
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and

mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Clearance decisions must be fair and
impartial decisions based upon relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-
person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although
the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not
outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case
can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,
Guideline C (foreign preference), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most
relevant in this case. 
  The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of5
the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant6
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.    11

Analysis
Guideline C, Foreign Preference
Foreign preference is a concern because when an individual acts in such a way as
to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may
be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the
United States.
Applicant possesses a current Brazilian passport which he is unwilling to relinquish
or otherwise invalidate because he needs it to travel to Brazil on business and to visit
friends and relatives in Brazil. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 10(a): exercise of any right,
privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the
foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession
of a current foreign passport applies. 
Applicant has renewed his Brazilian passport on at least three occasions since he
became a U.S. citizen. He has used that passport to travel to Brazil in the past and he
intends to use it for future travel to Brazil. His children acquired dual citizenship with Brazil
by virtue of Applicant’s Brazilian citizenship, and the two oldest children have obtained
Brazilian passports to allow them to travel to Brazil with Applicant to visit friends and
relatives. 
As a dual citizen with Brazil, Applicant apparently does require a Brazilian passport
to travel to that country. However, he has resided in the U.S. since 1978, he has worked
continuously for the same employer in the U.S. since 1989, and he has been a U.S. citizen
since 1993. There is no record evidence to indicate why Applicant has retained his
Brazilian citizenship, or that he has ever considered renunciation of that citizenship as an
alternative to renewal of his Brazilian passport. 
Security clearance decisions are made in terms of the national interest and are in
no sense a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  There is nothing in this record12
to indicate that Applicant is anything but a loyal U.S. citizen or that he has an actual
preference for Brazil over the U.S. However, because Applicant retains a Brazilian passport
that he is unwilling to surrender, I am unable to find that he has refuted, extenuated, or
mitigated the foreign preference concerns alleged by the Government. Thus, I am
compelled to find no mitigating condition exists and that Applicant has failed to mitigate the
foreign preference security concern.
    
  I have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this
case, the whole-person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Applicant failed to
mitigate the foreign preference security concern that exists in this case. He has failed to
overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. Guideline C

is decided against Applicant. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant
Applicant a security clearance. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline C: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraph 1.a: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
