O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the 
guideline for financial considerations. Accordingly, her request for a security 
clearance is denied. 
  
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 20, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required for her 
employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing 
background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and

Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s request.  
 
 On July 16, 2010, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the 
Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines (AG).2 In her Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on August 4, 
2010, Applicant admitted allegations 1.a. and 1.c. under Guideline F and denied 
the remaining allegations. She also requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge.  
 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September 1, 2010, and 
the case was assigned to me on September 7, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of 
Hearing on September 15, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
October 14, 2010. During the hearing, I admitted six Government exhibits (GE 1-
6). Applicant and one witness testified. She also offered eight exhibits, which I 
admitted as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through H. I held the record open to allow 
Applicant to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted eight 
documents, admitted without objection as AE I through P. DOHA received the 
transcript on October 21, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After 
a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and the 
evidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional findings of 
fact. 
 
 Applicant, who is 62 years old, completed a bachelor’s degree in 1972 and 
a master’s degree in 2005. She married in 1988, and has a 27-year-old daughter 
and a 37-year-old son. She divorced in 2002. Applicant worked as an office 
manager for approximately five years between 1998 and 2003. She was 
unemployed for almost one year between 2003 and 2004. She worked for federal 
contractors between 2004 and 2006. She obtained her current position with a 
federal contractor (employer A) in October 2006. She is a senior technical writer 
and developer. Applicant accepted a position as an adjunct college professor at 
employer B in 2005, and a second teaching position at employer C in 2006. 
Applicant continues to work part-time for employer B. This is her first application 
for security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 20-22; 72, 99, 108) 
 
1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as 
amended. 
 
2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  
 
 
 
3  
                                                     
 Applicant’s daughter has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She lives 
with Applicant and works intermittently for short periods, when her medication 
does not interfere with her performance. Applicant's daughter is not covered by 
Applicant's health insurance. Applicant’s son was unemployed from May 2008 to 
at least May 2009. She helps him with his expenses. She took care of her mother 
when she became ill in about 2004. She paid her mother’s medical bills and 
home care costs. Her sisters did not contribute to their mother’s support. 
Applicant paid for medical expenses during her mother’s terminal illness in 2006, 
and the funeral and burial. (GE 2; Tr. 20, 67, 100) 
 
 Applicant has filed her income tax returns every year. However, starting in 
about 1995, two of her employers withheld insufficient amounts from her pay, 
resulting in a tax debt. (Tr. 63, 101) Applicant testified, 
 
I’m not quite sure of the year, but I was working for a contractor, 
and that contractor did not take out enough taxes, so the taxes 
became to get more and more.  I paid the first one.  I noticed that 
they weren’t taking out enough.  But the second one and the one in 
2006, I wasn’t able to pay it, basically because my mom was 
terminally ill, and I had to help her.  So I was unable to pay. (Tr. 19) 
 
In the years when Applicant's income tax obligation was relatively small, 
approximately $400 to $500, she paid it. When it was more, she could not afford 
to pay it all, but sometimes sent a partial payment with her return. Applicant tried 
reducing her exemptions to increase her withholding. She has not requested that 
an additional amount be withheld from her salary. In 2003, Applicant requested a 
payment plan from the IRS, and started paying $300 per month. She then lost 
her job and was unemployed for about 10 months. She found employment in 
June 2004, and started her adjunct teaching positions in 2005 and 2006. She no 
longer made the IRS payments. In about 2008, the IRS garnished $1,200 per pay 
period from Applicant's salary from employer A. As a result, in January 2009, she 
satisfied a lien of $12,634, which covered tax years 1996, 1997, 2002, and 
2003.3 Applicant was due refunds in 1997 and 2003, but the IRS applied them to 
her delinquent tax debt. It also seized approximately $1,500 from her bank 
account. (GE 3; AE F, G; Tr. 41-42, 46-50, 58-59, 63-66, 85-92)  
 
 The SOR alleges the following additional federal liens, which total 
$29,455: 
  
 a lien of $4,800, filed in 2001, for tax years 1993 and 1995; and  
 
 a lien of $24,555, filed in 2009, for tax years 2006 and 2007.  
 
3 This satisfied lien is not alleged in the SOR and, therefore, will be considered only as part of the 
whole-person analysis. 
 
 
 
4  
                                                     
Applicant testified she did not receive a notice of the $4,800 lien, and called the 
IRS to request one “a couple of years ago.” She did not pursue the request since 
then. After her May 2009 security interview, Applicant contacted the IRS and was 
advised to complete a form requesting an installment plan. In April 2010, 
Applicant made one payment of $503 toward the IRS liens. In September 2010, 
one month before the hearing, she contacted the IRS and requested a 
installment plan. She expected a response within 30 to 60 days. She did not 
provide evidence of a response during or after the hearing. (GE 1, 3, 4; AE F – I; 
Tr. 19-20, 58-62, 92, 96-97) 
 
 Applicant attempted to refinance her mother’s house, in order to obtain 
additional funds to pay off her IRS liens and other debts. She did not qualify for 
the loan because of her low credit score. She may attempt to qualify in the future, 
when her score improves. In 2004, Applicant paid a tax advice company $1,500 
to review her taxes, ensure the amounts owed were correct, and to negotiate a 
payment plan or an offer in compromise with the IRS. The company reviewed her 
taxes, but required an additional $1,500 to continue, and Applicant could not 
afford to pay it. Several years later, in about 2006, Applicant contacted a CPA for 
assistance, but could not afford the $3,000 fee. She has never been advised to 
increase the amount of tax withheld from her pay. (Tr. 93-96) (GE 3; Tr. 39-40) 
 
 Applicant’s monthly net pay as of mid-2010 was $6,550 (including her 
teaching salary). Her monthly expenses and debt payments total $5,600, leaving 
a monthly net remainder of $950.4 She does not have a savings account, but 
does contribute to a retirement plan. (GE 3; Tr. 39-40) 
 
 The nine debts listed in the SOR total almost $43,000. The delinquencies 
appear in Applicant's credit reports of May 2009 and January and June 2010. 
(GE 4-6, AE P) The status of the SOR debts, other than the IRS liens discussed 
previously, follows. 
 
• State tax lien: $8,504, PAID (allegation 1.c) – After her father died in 
1996, Applicant assumed responsibility for her mother’s medical care. As 
a result, she could not afford to pay her income taxes in state A, and a lien 
was filed in 1997. Applicant testified that she only became aware of the 
state lien about four years ago. She contacted the state tax office at that 
time. She did not pay it because she believed it was incorrect. She did not 
live in state A in 1997, having left in 1992, and she never worked in state 
A. She did not contact the state A tax office since the security investigation 
began. Although she testified that the state A lien had not been resolved, 
4 Applicant testified that she made only one payment of $503 to the IRS, rather than regular 
monthly payments of this amount listed on her personal financial statement. Without that monthly 
payment, her net monthly remainder is $1,450. (GE 3)

she provided a Release of Lien after the hearing showing that the debt 
was satisfied in 2003.5 (GE 2, 4; AE J; Tr. 22-23, 54-55, 97) 
 
$         Credit card: $1,169, UNPAID (Allegation 1.d.) - Applicant opened this 
credit card account to pay for her mother’s expenses. At her May 2009 
security interview, she stated she had contacted the creditor and 
negotiated an agreement to pay $800 by June 2009, noting that the 
account would be paid within a few months. She did not pay the debt in 
2009. Between 2006 and 2010, she made two payments. In April 2010, 
Applicant offered a $100 payment to settle the account. On September 1, 
2010, she requested the creditor validate the debt. On September 15, 
2010, the creditor notified her of the original creditor, account number, and 
the balance due of $1,190. As of September 15, 2010, the creditor was 
investigating to determine if the amount owed is correct. Applicant did not 
submit documentation during or after the hearing showing the balance had 
been determined or the account had been paid, and the debt appears on 
Applicant's November 2010 credit bureau report. (GE 2, 5; AE A, B; K, P; 
Tr. 25-31, 39, 74-76) 
 
$        Medical debts totaling $510, PAID (allegations 1.e. and 1.f) – At her 
May 2009 security interview, Applicant was unsure about the source of 
these medical debts. On September 1, 2010, she asked the creditor to 
validate that they were her debts. On September 15, 2010, the creditor 
confirmed that the debt stemmed from hospital services for her daughter. 
Applicant provided documentation showing that she paid both debts 
through deduction from her bank account on October 22, 2010. (GE 2; AE 
A, L, M; Tr. 25-26) 
 
$   Wrecker service, $1,788, UNPAID (allegation 1.g.) At her May 2009 
security interview, Applicant stated she paid $200 for towing service after 
her car was totaled in an accident. The car was sold and the proceeds 
applied to the debt. Applicant was unaware that she owed anything 
further. The debt became delinquent in 2003. In about 2008, she 
contacted the credit reporting agencies to dispute the debt. She did not 
receive a response. She testified that the debt did not appear on her credit 
bureau report, but then re-appeared. On April 6, 2010, Applicant offered 
the creditor $100 as a settlement. On September 1, 2010, she asked the 
creditor to validate the debt. She did not receive a response. The debt 
appears on her 2009 credit bureau report, but not the 2010 credit bureau 
reports. (GE 2, 4, 5, 6; AE A, N; Tr. 25, 68-71)  
 
5 Applicant was married in 1988 and divorced in 2002. As of April 2009, her ex-husband lived in 
state A. The record does not indicate if it was Applicant's husband who paid the lien in 2003. (GE 
1) 
 
 
 
6  
                                                     
• Telephone: $119, UNPAID (allegation 1.h.) – In her May 2009 security 
interview, Applicant stated she was not aware of this debt, and would 
investigate it within 30 days. In May 2010, she contacted the creditor, and 
was told the debt would be removed from her credit bureau report, 
because it was not her debt. She provided a letter showing that a phone 
account with the creditor listed in the SOR had been deleted from her 
credit bureau report. However, the account number and the balance 
($500) shown on Applicant's exhibit are not the same as those reflected in 
the Government’s 2009 credit bureau report. Therefore, it appears that 
Applicant's exhibit does not refer to the same account that appears in the 
SOR. The SOR debt does not appear in Applicant's January or June 2010 
credit bureau reports. (GE 3, 4, 5, 6; AE C; Tr. 31-34, 76-80) 
 
$        Credit card: $1,427, DISPUTED (Allegation 1.i.) - Applicant opened this 
credit card account in 2006 to help her son with his expenses. The creditor 
sold the account to a collection agency in 2008. After falling behind in her 
payments, Applicant negotiated a new payment arrangement in April 2009 
of $60 per month.6 She told the security investigator in May 2009 that it 
would be paid off within a few months. She testified that she believes she 
paid the debt in full. In September 2010, Applicant disputed this account 
with the creditor. She provided evidence that the creditor requested this 
account be deleted from Applicant's credit bureau report. The debt does 
not appear on Applicant's November 2010 credit bureau report. (GE 2, 4, 
5, 6; AE A, D, E, K, O, P; Tr. 25, 36-38, 71-74, 81-83) 
 
Applicant’s friend testified that she has known Applicant since 1977, when 
they were both young teachers. They see each other about twice per month, and 
are in phone or email contact every day. She has been to Applicant's home, and 
notes that Applicant lives frugally and is careful with her money. Applicant was 
the emotional and financial support for her mother during her terminal illness. 
The witness has known Applicant's daughter since she was born. She testified 
that, because of the daughter’s mental condition, Applicant is her sole financial 
support. She attested to Applicant's strong sense of integrity. (Tr. 105-113) 
 
Policies 
 
 Each security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and 
material information, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication 
policy in the AG.7 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in 
¶ 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the “whole-person” concept. 
6 The report of Applicant's interview notes that she stated she was paying $600 per month. 
Applicant corrected this amount at the hearing, testifiying that the arrangement was for $60 per 
month. (GE 2; Tr. 72)

7  
                                                     
 The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does 
not determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific 
applicable guidelines are followed when a case can be measured against them 
as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented 
by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative 
factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at AG ¶ 18. 
 
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest8 for an applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the 
initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the 
preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. 
Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in 
the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to 
refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.  
 
 Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a 
heavy burden of persuasion.9 A person who has access to classified information 
enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and 
confidence. Therefore, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each applicant possesses the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect 
the national interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national 
interest” standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an 
applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.10 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and 
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of 
which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An 
individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a 
concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is 
8 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). 
 
9 Id. at 528, 531. 
 
10 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
8  
also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially 
profitable criminal acts. 
 
 The evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG ¶19 (a) 
(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG ¶19 (c) (a history of not 
meeting financial obligations). The SOR alleges $37,859 in unpaid back taxes 
owed to the federal and state governments. The state tax lien, $8,504, was paid 
in 2003, though the record is unclear about whether it was Applicant who paid it. 
The federal liens, totaling $29,355, remain unpaid. Applicant's history 
demonstrates a failure to meet financial obligations. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute 
or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Applicant's debts are both recent and frequent. They have been accruing 
for years. They are not in the distant past, as approximately $29,000 in federal 
income taxes remains unpaid. Her inattention to her financial obligations may 
recur in the future. Her failure to make consistent attempts to resolve her debts 
over the years, until recently, raises questions as to her reliability and judgment. 
AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 Only partial credit is available under AG ¶ 20(b). Applicant has had 
circumstances that affected her ability to pay her debts. She was unemployed for 
almost one year. She supports her daughter, who cannot remain consistently 
employed. She supported her mother financially for years, and helps her son with 
his expenses. However, these situations have been spread over the past ten 
years, and during most of this time Applicant was gainfully employed, even 
receiving extra income for several years from additional jobs. She has almost 
 
 
9  
$1,000 remaining at the end of the month. Applicant has not acted responsibly 
toward her debts by using these funds to consistently pay her debts.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant testified 
that she made payments on her IRS tax liens in the past. However, the liens that 
were resolved were primarily paid through garnishments of her pay and seizure 
of her tax refunds. Such payments do not constitute a good-faith effort. Although 
the state lien is paid, it does not appear to have been through Applicant's efforts, 
as she testified that it was not paid, even though it had been paid in 2003. She 
paid two medical debts of about $500 about one week after the hearing. She 
successfully disputed a credit card debt, but not until one month before the 
hearing. Applicant's actions have been recent, and occurred shortly before the 
hearing. She receives some credit under AG ¶ 20(d) for making payments in 
2003 to the IRS. 
 
 Applicant successfully disputed a telephone debt and it was removed from 
her credit report, although it was not the account that was alleged in the SOR. 
She provided documentation showing she disputed one credit card debt listed in 
the SOR, which was removed from her credit report. AG ¶ 20(e) applies.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate 
an applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented 
and have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I 
have also reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the 
appropriate guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. 
 
 
 
10  
 Applicant is a mature and educated adult, who has demonstrated 
character in her personal life by assisting her adult son financially, caring for her 
mother’s medical needs, and supporting her adult daughter who suffers from a 
mental condition. Applicant's non-tax delinquencies amount to about $3,000, 
which is not security-significant, given her income. However, more than $29,000 
in past-due federal income tax liens remains unpaid. Applicant recently satisfied 
an additional $12,634 federal lien, but it was paid primarily through garnishment 
and seizure of her refunds, rather than her own efforts. Her failure to stay abreast 
of her debts over the past several years can be ascribed in part to bearing family 
financial burdens. But her lack of diligence about her obligations to the federal 
government is a serious concern. Her independent actions to resolve her tax 
debts have been inconsistent. Many of her steps were taken shortly before the 
hearing, indicating that she was responding more to the security process than to 
her legitimate obligations. Applicant failed to act responsibly when she did not 
rectify her persistent under-withholding, which started in the 1990s. Her lack of 
attention to her federal tax debt, and sporadic efforts on other debts, do not 
demonstrate reliability and good judgment.  
 
A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information shows 
that Applicant has not satisfied the doubts raised about her suitability for a 
security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by 
section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST Applicant 
 
 Subparagraphs 1.a. – 1.h.    Against Applicant  
  
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant’s request for 
a security clearance is denied.
