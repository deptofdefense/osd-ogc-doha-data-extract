GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance or access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 25, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an ESPQ version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories 
pertaining to his financial situation. He responded to the interrogatories on June 29, 
2010.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him another set of interrogatories, 
again pertaining to his financial situation. He responded to the interrogatories on June 
29, 2010.3 On August 17, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated February 25, 2005. 
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated June 29, 2010).

pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 24, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on September 10, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on October 14, 2010, and 
the case was assigned to me on November 9, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
January 4, 2011, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on January 26, 2011. 
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (1-5) and 10 Applicant exhibits (A-J) 
were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The record remained 
open to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on January 28, 2011, he 
submitted 22 additional exhibits (K-AF) which were admitted into evidence without 
objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on February 10, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in ¶¶ 
1.a. through 1.f. of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings 
of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon 
due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a weather observer or technician,4 and he is seeking to retain a SECRET security 
clearance. He was previously granted a SECRET security clearance in 1999 or 2000.5 
A May 1996 high school graduate, he received an associate’s degree in 1999, and is 
presently two classes shy of obtaining a bachelor’s degree in environmental science.6 
Applicant worked part-time and full-time as a fast food server and a construction laborer 
until June 1999, when he enlisted in the U. S. Air Force.7 After serving on active duty for 
six years, primarily as a weather technician, in the United States, as well as in the Far 
4 Tr. at 63, 89. 
 
5 In his SF 86, supra note 1, at 9, Applicant indicated he was granted a security clearance in April 1999. 
During his hearing, he stated the clearance was granted “around” 2000. Id. at 6, 88.

East and the Middle East,8 Applicant decided to leave active duty because he wanted a 
family to come home to every night and a “steady job at home,” not overseas.9 He 
decided to pursue his dream to become a realtor, and concluded his military service in 
2005.10 In September 2007, Applicant married, and in March 2009, he and his wife had 
a son.11  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2006. Upon 
leaving active military service and becoming a realtor, Applicant found the local housing 
market to be “very good.” He was successful for about eight to ten months.12 However, 
his optimism was short-lived for, in 2006, the “bottom fell out” of the local housing 
market as the U.S. economy started to deteriorate.13 His income was severely impacted 
and significantly reduced. In 2008, he managed sell only one home.14 The following 
year, he sold several homes.15 In an effort to generate more money to make up for his 
lost real estate commissions, Applicant took part-time jobs as a desk clerk and a door 
man at a local resort.16 In May 2007, he started working for his current employer as a 
weather technician.17 His wife’s health became a serious issue creating several 
thousands of dollars in medical bills.18 When his son was born, both his wife and his 
son experienced health problems, adding additional medical expenses.19 With medical 
bills coming in and his wife no longer working, Applicant was unable to remain current 
with his monthly bills without additional income. He occasionally borrowed some money 
from his family to keep his bills current, but the rising gasoline prices and the absence of 
qualified buyers made his real estate career difficult.20 As a result, accounts became 
delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off.

In 2008 and 2009, Applicant sought a loan modification on his residential 
mortgage in an effort to reduce his monthly payments. The bank representative required 
a lump sum payment of $4,400 just to qualify for the loan modification program, as well 
as increased monthly payments to repay the deficiency.21 Negotiations collapsed when 
the creditor refused to reduce the required payments and Applicant was unable to 
continue paying both delinquent amounts and the increased monthly payments. 
Applicant’s residence went into foreclosure, and in November 2010, it was sold to the 
creditor for $100.22 Prior to the actual foreclosure, Applicant brought a potential buyer to 
the creditor but the offer was rejected.23 At the time of the foreclosure, the total 
outstanding balance was $192,712.16. After deducting the foreclosure sale price and 
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan guaranty, the deficiency balance 
came to $168,669.87. The creditor elected to write off the remaining deficiency and 
waived its right to pursue the deficiency balance.24 Applicant no longer owes that 
deficiency balance. 
 
In 2010, Applicant managed to sell one house,25 and his income was again 
reduced because his employer curtailed all weekend and evening schedules and 
reduced the work week to 32 hours.26 Applicant no longer works shifts and lost his night 
time salary differential.27 His wife recently was certified as a group fitness instructor and 
is anticipating obtaining a position at a local fitness center.28 
 
In 2008 or 2009, Applicant attended a financial seminar conducted at his 
church.29 He also watched a video and had the opportunity to learn the Dave Ramsey 
method of financial management involving debt management, budgeting, money 
management, and repayment strategies.30 Applicant has a plan and a budget, but 
presently he has insufficient funds to make a significant dent in his delinquencies. He 
has a spread sheet to track and prioritize expenses,31 and has reduced all unnecessary

expenses.32 Nevertheless, following the Ramsey video feed, Applicant called all of his 
creditors in an effort to establish repayment plans.33 In addition, as a result of his 
delinquencies, limited income, the horrible local housing market, and the general state 
of the economy, Applicant also met with an attorney to explore the possibility of filing 
bankruptcy. He failed the “means test” necessary to file bankruptcy,34 and his only 
alternative was to reduce all “unnecessary” expenditures and pay his debts.  
 
Applicant currently has a $3,100 monthly salary, $242 monthly VA disability, and 
$935 monthly GI Bill student support, for a total monthly income of $4,535.35 In addition, 
he recently received $8,100 on a British Petroleum environmental claim due to the oil 
spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and $3,100 in real estate commissions.36 He estimated he 
has a monthly remainder of $150 available for discretionary spending.37 Applicant 
intends to eventually pay off or settle all of his delinquencies as soon as the economy 
improves, and the local housing market picks up. He remains confident he will be 
successful.38 
 
The SOR identified six purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit 
reports from 2009 and 2010, totaling approximately $181,918 in collection or charged 
off accounts and an additional $487 in a past due account. Some accounts reflected in 
the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or 
collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly, in many instances 
duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a 
different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by complete account numbers, 
while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the 
last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. Some accounts reflect no account 
number. The information reflected is not necessarily accurate or up to date.  
 
Of the six accounts, two have been paid off or settled (SOR ¶¶ 1.c.39 and 1.f.40), 
three are being paid under an agreed repayment plan (SOR ¶¶ 1.a.,41 1.d.,42 and

Applicant’s local board of realtors dues are current,46 and he has three properties

Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Applicant’s enlisted performance reports reflect the highest ratings possible. His 
compliance with standards was “Exemplifies top military standards;” his knowledge of 
military duties was “Excels in knowledge of all related positions. Masters all duties;” and 
his performance of assigned duties was “The exception. Absolutely superior in all 
areas.”49 He was routinely recommended for immediate promotion. His real estate 
broker has known him for three years and has characterized him as a “hard working, 
very devoted trustworthy man.”50 A friend, who has known Applicant for six years, said 
he always remains calm and composed, and he is honest and committed with the 
utmost integrity.51 Applicant’s site supervisor, a person who has known Applicant since

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”54 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”55   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”56 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the

56 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.57  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”58 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”59 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
57 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until about 2006. At some point, he failed to keep up with his monthly 
payments, and accounts started to become delinquent. Some accounts were placed for 
collection, and some accounts were charged off. He lost his home to foreclosure. AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@60  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced sometime in 2006, when the bottom 
fell out of the local housing market and the U.S. economy started to deteriorate. As a 
realtor, the rising gasoline prices, the absence of qualified buyers, and the stagnant real 
estate market were devastating. Because his financial difficulties commenced nearly 
five years ago and continued until the present, it was initially frequent and continuing in 
nature. However, Applicant addressed the situation, and, in an attempt to generate 
more income to satisfy his debts, he took additional part-time jobs as a desk clerk and a 
door man at a local resort. Then he sought and obtained a position with his current 
employer. While the local real estate market and the U.S. economy have not yet 
rebounded, his actions to mitigate his financial situation, under the circumstances, does 
60 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

not cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.61 
AG ¶ 20(a) applies.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies because there were several conditions, largely beyond 
Applicant’s control, that made a substantial negative impact on Applicant’s financial 
situation. The devastated economy and local housing market effectively destroyed 
Applicant’s ability to make a living in real estate, at least in the short term, until the 
present. The business downturn in the housing market was so severe that it effectively 
constituted a loss of employment. The unexpected medical bills, generated because of 
health issues for both his wife and son, merely exacerbated his financial problems. 
These events were clearly beyond Applicant’s control, and Applicant acted responsibly 
to address the debts that resulted.62 
 
AG & 20(c) applies because Applicant received financial counseling, and there is 
clear and abundant evidence that his financial problems are being resolved and are 
under control. While he still has delinquent accounts, he has established a budget, 
presented a personal financial statement, and is following his repayment plans in 
reducing his delinquencies.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) applies because Applicant attempted to address his delinquent debts 
well before the SOR was issued. Nevertheless, circumstances were such that he was 
unable to resolve them all either by settling them or by paying them off, although he 
attempted to do so.63 He has paid off or settled, or otherwise resolved accounts with 
several creditors, including some non-SOR creditors, and is currently active with 
repayment plans for the remaining creditors. The sole exception is his home equity loan 
or “purchase money” second mortgage, which is awaiting a decision by the creditor to 
determine if the balance will be excused or remain due. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
61 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
62 Id. at 4. 
 
63 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has a 
history of financial delinquencies commencing in 2006. He permitted accounts to 
become delinquent and placed for collection or charged off. He lost his home to 
foreclosure. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. 
Applicant’s financial delinquencies were the unfortunate consequence of a devastated 
economy and local housing market, as well as unanticipated medical expenses. 
Applicant was unable to sustain himself as a realtor because of the rising gasoline 
prices, the absence of qualified buyers, and the stagnant real estate market. 
Nevertheless, he addressed the situation and took additional part-time jobs as well as a 
new permanent position. He did not turn his back on his creditors. Instead, he has paid 
off or settled, or otherwise resolved accounts with several creditors, including some 
non-SOR creditors, and is currently active with repayment plans for the remaining 
creditors. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.64 His substantial 
good-faith efforts are sufficient to mitigate continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 
2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
