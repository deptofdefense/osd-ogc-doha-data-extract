GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 4, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on August 9, 2010.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him 
another set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on September 20, 
2010.3 On November 17, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated March 4, 2009. 
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated August 9, 2010).

pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 1, 2010. In a written statement, dated 
December 21, 2010, Applicant’s attorney responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared 
to proceed on January 26, 2011, and the case was assigned to Administrative Judge 
Robert Tuider on February 1, 2011. It was reassigned to me on February 10, 2011. A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on March 2, 2011, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on March 22, 2011. 
 
 During the hearing, four Government exhibits (GE 1-4) and seven Applicant 
exhibits (AE A, and C-H) were admitted into evidence without objection or over 
objection.4 Applicant objected to GE 5 for identification, and Department Counsel 
objected to AE B for identification. I withheld rulings pertaining to the two documents 
and afforded the parties the opportunity to submit briefs regarding same. Applicant and 
two other witnesses testified on his behalf. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on 
March 30, 2011. The record was kept open until April 5, 2011, to enable the parties to 
furnish the briefs, and kept open until April 15, 2011, to enable them to submit written 
closing arguments.  
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
As noted above, Applicant objected to GE 5 for identification (GE 5/ID)5 because 
no foundation had been presented.6 During a discussion on the objection, Department 
Counsel acknowledged GE 5/ID had not been developed during the investigation and 
was not a component of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) report of 
investigation. Instead, GE 5/ID was obtained by a DOHA security specialist – an 
 
3 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated September 2, 2010). 
 
4 Applicant’s objection to Government Exhibit 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit 
Report, dated October 21, 2009), was overruled. Likewise, Department Counsel’s objection to Applicant Exhibit C 
(Initial Forensic Mortgage Audit, dated February 22, 2011), was overruled.

adjudicator – in preparation for the drafting of the SOR.7 He also urged that I reconsider 
because GE 5/ID is a relevant and material document.8 In his brief in support of 
admission, Department Counsel claimed the admission of GE 5/ID was justified and 
commented on the general rules of admissibility in DOHA cases; the admissibility of 
credit reports as business records; and the rules for authentication of documents. 
Department Counsel went further by stating:9  
 
In this instance, the Credit Bureau Report was collected and furnished by 
the DOHA personnel under the authority of the Directive and E.O. 10865 
(enclosure 1 to the Directive), and Paragraph E3.1.2 of the Additional 
Procedural Guidance of the Directive. The latter empowers DOHA to take 
interim actions necessary to determining whether to grant or continue a 
security clearance. The list of Actions provided in Paragraph E3.1.2 of the 
Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive is not exclusive. 
 
In his brief against the admission, Applicant’s attorney claimed admission of GE 
5/ID was not justified, and noted that Paragraph E3.1.20 of the Directive states that 
official records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business are 
admissible so long as they have been furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to 
its responsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of Defense. 
 
While the Directive may empower DOHA to take various interim actions, 
including the issuance of interrogatories, necessary to determining whether to grant or 
continue a security clearance, contrary to Department Counsel’s assertion that there is 
no specific limitation on such actions, there are such limitations. Paragraph E3.1.20 sets 
one of those limitations.10 In general, an investigator investigates and an adjudicator 
adjudicates. In this instance, the adjudicator crossed the line and functioned as an 
investigator in order to perfect evidence in support of allegations in an SOR against 
Applicant.11 GE 5/ID was not furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its 
responsibilities under E.O. 10865. Accordingly, Applicant’s objection to GE 5/ID is 
sustained. 
 
Also as noted above, Department Counsel objected to AE B for identification (AE 
B/ID) because it was merely an answer to a complaint, and as such, it was not the best

10 The following limitation applies: 
 
Official records or evidence compiled or created in the regular course of business, other than DoD 
personnel background reports of investigation (ROI), may be received and considered by the 
Administrative Judge without authenticating witnesses, provided that such information has been 
furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its responsibilities in connection with assisting the 
Secretary of Defense, or the Department or Agency head concerned. . . . 
 
11 During his presentation, Department Counsel acknowledged that the adjudicator was acting in an 
investigative capacity. See Tr. at 28.

evidence available.12 He also noted that the document merely refers to allegations that 
had not yet been decided by the court.13 Along with his brief on the issue, Applicant 
subsequently submitted the original complaint to merge with AE B/ID. Department 
Counsel did not submit a brief. Based on the issues presented in the SOR, I find that AE 
B/ID as supplemented is relevant and material. Accordingly, Department Counsel’s 
objection to AE B/ID is overruled and AE B is admitted. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.b. and 1.d.) of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. He denied the remaining factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a., 1.c., and 2.a.) of the SOR. 
After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a parts inspection specialist.14 He is seeking to obtain a secret security clearance. A 
1994 high school graduate, Applicant has a May 1998 bachelor of science degree in 
chemistry, a 2007 master of science degree in quality management systems, and a May 
2009 master of science degree in industrial systems engineering.15 Over the years, 
Applicant has held several different positions with various employers. He was a 
production and analytical chemist from February 1999 until August 1999;16 a research 
and development chemist from September 1999 until May 2003;17 a newspaper 
“deliverer” from June 2003 until April 2004;18 and a quality control inspector at two 
different companies from April 2004 until January 2005, and from February 2005 until 
May 2005.19 He joined his current employer as a parts inspector in April 2005.20 
Applicant has never served with the U.S. military.21 
 
Applicant was never married,22 but he and his fiancée have two children, a son 
(born in 2004) and a daughter (born in 2006).23

Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about August 2008 
when, because of the downturn in the economy, his employer eliminated overtime and 
he was put on furlough with mandatory days off without pay.24 The absence of overtime 
continued through March 2009.25 Unforeseen expenses occurred, especially when the 
air conditioning unit at his residence failed.26 During a three-month period of no 
overtime, during which Applicant needed funds to enable him to pay his mortgage, he 
borrowed about $1,700 from his father each month.27 Applicant repaid his father 
$5,076.68 in March 2009.28 At some unspecified point thereafter, Applicant started to 
again be delinquent on his monthly accounts. 
 
The SOR identified three purportedly continuing delinquencies, as reflected by 
credit reports from 2009,29 and 2010,30 totaling approximately $37,111, in charged-off 
or past due accounts. Some accounts reflected in the credit reports have been 
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts 
are referenced repeatedly, in many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either 
under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. Some accounts are 
identified by complete account numbers, while others are identified by partial account 
numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating 
other digits. The information reflected is not necessarily accurate or up to date.  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): On November 13, 2007, Applicant financed the purchase of a 
planned unit with a mortgage of $209,000 from a local bank.31 His monthly payments 
were $1,303.89.32 Applicant fell behind in his mortgage payments, and on August 26,

2009, Freddie Mac Default Asset Management (Freddie Mac) informed Applicant that 
he might be eligible for the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), “which is a 
part of the federal Making Home Affordable Program to help homeowners avoid 
foreclosure whenever possible.”33 He was advised that there were no costs associated 
with the program.34 Applicant was also told:35 
 
First, Home Retention Services will determine if you are eligible, based on 
your financial situation. If you are, Home Retention Services will look at 
your monthly income and housing costs, including any past due payments, 
and then determine an affordable mortgage payment. At first, you will 
make the new monthly mortgage payment during a Trial Period. If you 
make those payments successfully and fulfill all Trial Period conditions, 
[the mortgage lender] will permanently modify your mortgage loan.  
 
The modification may involve one or more of the following changes: 1) 
bringing your account current; 2) reducing the interest rate on your loan; 3) 
extending the term of the loan, and/or 4) delaying your repayment of a 
portion of the mortgage principal until the end of the loan term. 
 
Applicant submitted a hardship affidavit to Freddie Mac.36 On October 6, 2009, 
Freddie Mac informed Applicant that he was deemed eligible for a loan modification 
under the HAMP.37 He was advised that if his income documentation did not support 
the income amount discussed, two things could happen: his monthly payment under a 
trial period plan could change, or he might not qualify for the loan modification 
program.38 If he did not qualify, Freddie Mac “will work with you to explore other options 
available to help you keep your home or ease your transition to a new home.”39  The 
trial period established under the plan commenced with a monthly payment of 
$1,246.86 due on or before November 1, 2009, and was to continue for three months.40 
Applicant contends that at some point in the loan modification process he was advised

by the mortgage lender that in order to be eligible for a loan modification he must be 
behind in his payments.41 Nevertheless, Applicant made his timely payments under the 
trial period plan.42 At some point, the mortgage lender persuaded Applicant to continue 
making his monthly payments beyond the trial period while the modification process 
was underway so as to make it more affordable for Applicant and to avoid foreclosure.43 
Believing that the modification was imminent, Applicant continued making his payments 
for an additional two mont 44
 
On March 11, 2010, Applicant received written notice from the mortgage lender 
that his application for loan modification had been rejected and that his initial 
qualification for the program had been a mistake.45 The mortgage lender demanded all 
delinquent payments.46 On an unspecified date, the mortgage lender filed an action to 
foreclose Applicant’s mortgage, claiming $204,495.12 in principal on the mortgage, 
together with interest from October 1, 2009, late charges, and costs.47 In April 2010, 
Applicant engaged an attorney to represent him in the foreclosure action.48 Applicant’s 
attorney secured the services of a licensed mortgage broker to perform a forensic audit 
of the paperwork associated with Applicant’s foreclosure action. The initial report was 
issued in February 2011, and it found substantial irregularities on the part of the 
mortgage lender.49  
 
In his Answer to the foreclosure complaint, Applicant asserted a number of 
affirmative defenses, including the following:50 (1) there is a lack of standing because 
the plaintiff in the action is not the original mortgage lender; (2) the plaintiff has unclean 
hands because it engaged in a pattern of criminal activity involving falsifying information 
on the loan application; falsifying mortgage documents; violating the Financial 
Institutions Reform Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA);51 and violating 
the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)52 by

payments to his account; (4) failing to fulfill all conditions precedent to the acceleration 
of the Note and Mortgage; (5) maintaining a pattern of waiver; and (6) equitable 
estoppel. No decision regarding the foreclosure action has yet been rendered. 
 
The October 2009 credit report indicates the mortgage account had a balance of 
$205,140, with a past due balance of $3,343, that was 60 days past due.53 The July 
2010 credit report indicates the mortgage account had a balance of $204,495, with a 
past due balance of $14,834, that was 180 days past due.54 It reflects no mortgage 
payments having been made by Applicant during or after the HAMP trial period plan, 
although Applicant made five such payments. The December 2010 credit report 
indicates the mortgage account had a balance of $204,495, with a past due balance of 
$22,982, and indicated there was a foreclosure proceeding pending.55 It too reflects no 
mortgage payments having been made by Applicant during or after the HAMP trial 
period plan. 
 
 (SOR ¶ 1.b.): Applicant had a bank credit card which he opened in 2007 to pay 
for utilities and gifts. When his employer eliminated overtime and he was put on furlough 
with mandatory days off without pay, and Applicant encountered unexpected expenses, 
his monthly accounts started to become delinquent. Applicant routinely made payments 
of the minimum amount due, and the interest rate on the card started to climb.56 At 
some point in early 2009, the account became delinquent and was placed for collection. 
The October 2009 credit report indicates the account had a balance of $12,652, with a 
past due balance of $2,346.57 The July 2010 and December 2010 credit reports reflect 
the same figures, but indicate the account was charged off.58 On January 21, 2009, 
over a year before the SOR was issued, Applicant signed a debt settlement agreement 
with a debt management company to obtain debt settlement services including financial 
guidance, budgeting, debt settlement, and creditor’s rights.59 Since he started the 
program, Applicant has received eight hours of financial counseling per month.60 The 
agreement called for the company to negotiate with two particular creditors (those listed 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.) the reduction of unsecured debt and settle accounts enrolled in

the 38 month program.61 Commencing in March 2009, Applicant made at least 20 
monthly payments of $381.51 to the company.62 That monthly amount included service 
fees and maintenance fees. The debt management company has already started 
settlement negotiations with the creditor,63 and once Applicant builds a sufficient 
reserve, the account will be resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Applicant had another bank credit card opened in 1999 to pay for 
routine bills, maintenance for his boat, and offshore gambling.64 When Applicant 
encountered his diminished income and unexpected expenses, this account started to 
become delinquent. Applicant routinely made payments of the minimum amount due, 
and at some point in early 2009, the account became delinquent and was charged off. 
The October 2009 credit report indicates the account had a balance of $9,666, with a 
past due balance of $9,663.65 The July 2010 and December 2010 credit reports reflect 
nearly identical figures.66 On December 7, 2010, with the assistance of his debt 
management company, Applicant and the creditor settled the account.67 The creditor 
agreed to accept a lump-sum payment in the amount of $5,010 as full and complete 
satisfaction of the debt.68 On or before February 1, 2011, Applicant paid the agreed 
amount, and the account was resolved as paid.69 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): Over the years, Applicant had a hobby of gambling online playing 
Texas Hold’em and card games.70 He generally played two times per week, spending 
$100 - $200 each time.71 Applicant acknowledged using his credit card, the one referred 
to in SOR ¶ 1.c., above, for his online gambling and estimated he charged $5,000 for 
such use.72 He has not gambled for at least two years.73

During the hearing, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting 
a net monthly income of $5,196.44; monthly expenses of $4,416.78; and debt 
repayments of $964.51.74 He estimated he had a monthly remainder of $815.15 
available for discretionary spending.75 Applicant contends, that with the exception of the 
one credit card for which there are current settlement negotiations, he is current on all 
other accounts and has not incurred any new debts.76 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
On March 4, 2009, when Applicant completed and submitted his SF 86, he 
responded to a question set forth in the SF 86. The SOR alleges Applicant deliberately 
failed to disclose complete information in response to the following financial question: § 
28b - (Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?). Appellant answered 
“no” to the question.77 He did not list either of his two delinquent accounts which came 
within the scope of the question (SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.). Applicant denied intending to 
convey a false impression and contended his response was based upon information he 
obtained in a credit report.78 The July 2010 and December 2010 credit reports both 
reflect that the accounts identified in SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c. were 90 days past due as of 
April 2009, not March 2009.79 Under those circumstances, Applicant answered the 
question truthfully, and did not deliberately falsify his response. 
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 The president of Applicant’s union local, who is also a coworker, is highly 
supportive of Applicant’s application for a security clearance. He believes Applicant has 
displayed a positive attitude and excellent work ethic, and is a “shining example of 
patriotism.”80 Applicant’s father and fiancée consider him trustworthy and faithful, and 
have never seen him demonstrate poor judgment.81

Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security

emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”82 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”83   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”84 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.85  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
82 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”86 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”87 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, if there are “financial problems that are linked to . . . gambling 
problems . . . ,” AG ¶ 19(f) is potentially disqualifying. As noted above, there was 
nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about August 2008 when, due to the 
downturn in the economy, his employer eliminated overtime and he was put on furlough 
with mandatory days off without pay. Although Applicant borrowed money to enable him 
to pay his mortgage, some accounts, including the one with which he gambled online, 
became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
19(c), and 19(f) apply. 
 
86 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
87 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
13 
                                      
 
                                                          
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@88 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about August 2008 
when, because of the downturn in the economy, his employer eliminated overtime and 
he was put on furlough with mandatory days off without pay. The absence of overtime 
continued through March 2009. When Applicant needed funds to enable him to pay his 
mortgage, he borrowed it from his father. Applicant repaid his father in March 2009. 
Applicant fell behind in his mortgage payments, and in August 2009, Freddie Mac 
informed Applicant that he might be eligible for HAMP, and was advised that he had to 
make the new monthly mortgage payment during a trial period. Once he fulfilled all trial 
period conditions, Applicant’s mortgage loan would be permanently modified. In October 
2009, Freddie Mac informed Applicant that he was deemed eligible for a loan 
modification under the HAMP. Applicant made his timely payments under the trial period 
plan, and continued making them for another two months to comply with the wishes of 
the mortgage lender. In March 2010, Applicant was notified that his application for loan 
modification had been rejected and that his initial qualification for the program had been 
a mistake. The mortgage lender demanded all delinquent payments, and when they 
were not forthcoming, the mortgage lender filed an action to foreclose Applicant’s 
mortgage. In his Answer to the foreclosure complaint, Applicant asserted a number of 
88 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

affirmative defenses, including many of those found to have existed by the conclusions 
of a regulatory review conducted by the various federal banking agencies and 
subsequent consent orders by and between those agencies and certain national banks, 
including the mortgage lender herein, designed to remedy the numerous matters 
requiring attention, including unsafe or unsound practices that were identified. No 
decision regarding the foreclosure action has yet been rendered. 
 
Of the two credit cards, one was placed for collection and the other was charged 
off. In January 2009, over a year before the SOR was issued, Applicant signed a debt 
settlement agreement with a debt management company to obtain debt settlement 
services including financial guidance, budgeting, debt settlement, and creditor’s rights. 
Since he started the program, Applicant received eight hours of financial counseling per 
month. The agreement called for the company to negotiate with two particular creditors 
(those credit cards listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.) the reduction of unsecured debt and 
settle accounts enrolled in the 38 month program. Commencing in March 2009, 
Applicant made at least 20 monthly payments to the company, and one delinquent 
credit card account was settled and paid off, and the debt management company has 
already started settlement negotiations with the remaining creditor. Once Applicant 
builds a sufficient reserve, the account will be resolved. Applicant is current on all other 
accounts and has not incurred any new debts. 
 
Much of what occurred was largely beyond Applicant’s control and took place 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant received counseling for 
his financial problems, and there are clear indications that the problems are now being 
resolved. The issues with the mortgage lender are not unlike similar issues found during 
the regulatory review conducted by the various federal banking agencies. Applicant 
acted responsibly under the circumstances, and his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment, are not in question. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e), 
apply. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 15:  
      
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns. Under AG ¶ 
16(a), a “deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to 
conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, 
 
15 
                                      
 
                                                          
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities,” is potentially disqualifying.  
 
Applicant’s omission in his response to the one inquiry in the e-QIP of critical 
information pertaining to financial delinquencies, provides sufficient evidence to 
examine if his submission was a deliberate falsification, as alleged in the SOR, or was 
the result of reliance on information appearing in a credit report, as he contends. As to 
the question pertaining to 90 day delinquencies, Applicant answered “no.” As noted 
above, a review of the July 2010 and December 2010 credit reports both reflect that the 
accounts identified in SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c. were 90 days past due as of April 2009, not 
March 2009. Under those circumstances, Applicant answered the question truthfully, 
and did not deliberately falsify his response. I had ample opportunity to evaluate the 
demeanor of Applicant, observe his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which 
he responded to questions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and 
listen to his testimony. It is my impression that his reliance on the information appearing 
in the credit reports was real and his explanations are consistent. Considering the 
quality of the other evidence before me, they have the solid resonance of truth. I find 
Applicant’s explanations are credible in his denial of deliberate falsification. AG ¶¶ 16(a) 
has not been established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the various aspects of 
this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a 
piecemeal analysis.89      
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has a 
history of financial delinquencies commencing in 2008, when he permitted accounts to 
89 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
16 
                                      
 
                                                          
become delinquent and placed for collection or charged off. He gambled and sustained 
approximately $5,000 in losses over the years. One account - his home mortgage - was 
moved into a foreclosure status. Two of his three accounts remain delinquent. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s initial financial delinquencies arose because of the downturn in the 
economy. His employer eliminated overtime and he was put on furlough with mandatory 
days off without pay. The absence of overtime continued through March 2009. Applicant 
borrowed needed funds to enable him to pay his mortgage, and eventually repaid the 
loan. He engaged the services of a debt management company to help him resolve two 
delinquent credit card accounts, and hired an attorney to dispute and defend a 
foreclosure action which he contends was filled with fraud. He settled one credit card 
debt, and is now working on the other credit card debt. The foreclosure action is in the 
state court, along with other such actions, and Applicant’s attorney believes Applicant 
can establish that the mortgage lender violated HAMP, FIRREA, and RESPA, among 
other laws. Applicant is current on all other accounts and has not incurred any new 
debts. Applicant did not turn his back on his creditors. Instead, he followed legal and 
financial advice. His substantial good-faith efforts are sufficient to mitigate continuing 
security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:90 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
90 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
17 
                                      
 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations and personal conduct. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    For Applicant 
   
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
