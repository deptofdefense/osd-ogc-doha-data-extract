GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 18, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to the 
interrogatories on August 9, 2010.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued him 
another set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on August 9, 2010.3

On October 27, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 1, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on November 12, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on January 26, 2011, and 
the case was assigned to me on February 2, 2011. A Notice of Hearing was issued on 
March 2, 2011, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 23, 2011.4 
 
 During the hearing, 5 Government exhibits (1-5) and 18 Applicant exhibits (A-R) 
were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The hearing transcript 
(Tr.) was received on March 31, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶¶ 1.a. 
through 1.d.) of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a senior systems integration and test engineer.5 He is seeking to retain a secret security 
clearance.6 He enrolled in the state college in May 2002, and with a self-guided study 
program, graduated with a bachelor of science in electrical engineering and technology 
in December 2007.7  
 
Over the years, since before he entered college, Applicant has held a number of 
different positions with various employers. He was an engineer from February 1985 until 
 
 
4 It apparently took one week for the Notice of Hearing to reach Applicant. As he was made telephonically 
aware of the hearing date before the issuance of the official notice, Applicant expressly waived the 15-day notice 
requirement. See Tr. at 12-13.

February 2004,8 then, with the same employer, was relocated to another state as an 
engineer where he remained until June 2006.9 He was laid off in June 2006, and 
remained unemployed until December 2006.10 From December 2006 until March 2007, 
he characterized himself as a real estate investor and student.11 Applicant joined his 
current employer in March 2007.12  
 
Applicant was married in June 1984.13 He has no children. He has never served 
with the U.S. military.14 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until June 2006 when both 
he and his wife were laid off from their respective jobs.15 His wife had been working at a 
local title company.16 While unemployed, Applicant and his wife lived off their savings 
and withdrawals from his 401(k) to pay their routine bills as well as two home 
mortgages.17 When Applicant finally received a job offer in December 2006, the salary 
offered was significantly less than what he had previously been making.18 In addition, 
the offer presented a dilemma, for if he accepted the job, he would be required to 
relocate to a different part of the state. The option was declining the job offer and 
remaining unemployed. He accepted the offer and relocated.19 Applicant’s wife 
eventually obtained a job in the new location, but, it too, was for a lower salary than she 
had before the layoff.20  
 
Applicant owns three properties, including the one in which he currently resides 
(property Charlie). He resided in property Alpha from the time he was relocated by his

employer in 2004, until he obtained his current position in 2007.21 The property was 
originally purchased by him as a rental property for $250,000, in January 2003.22 The 
property was appraised in 2004 at $517,000,23 but as of March 2009, had an estimated 
value of $300,000, with a first mortgage of $198,000 and a second mortgage of 
$294,000.24 The estimated value of the property decreased to $219,500 by January 
2011.25 When he moved away in 2007, he attempted to have it rented at $1,000 to 
$1,400 per month,26 but the rental agent was unable to obtain any tenants.27 The 
property has remained unoccupied, with the utilities on, and the lot maintained, since 
Applicant moved out.28  
 
Applicant’s monthly mortgage payments were $1,772.29Applicant exhausted all 
of his available assets in July 2009 and his monthly mortgage payments stopped.30 He 
estimates he is currently $45,000 in arrears on the first mortgage (SOR ¶ 1.c.), and it is 
in a foreclosure status.31 Negotiations between Applicant’s attorney and the mortgage 
lender have gone on for a substantial period, with a loan modification discussed, but 
never approved.32 In March 2009, the mortgage lender proposed Applicant refinance 
both his first and second mortgages with an adjustable rate mortgage of $498,000,33 but 
the matter was not consummated because of actions taken by the second mortgage 
lender, described more fully below. 
 
In January 2005, during a period of financial prosperity, Applicant applied at his 
credit union for a line of credit – essentially a second mortgage – on property Alpha 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.). His purpose for the second mortgage was to enable him to purchase 
another rental property.34 The credit union had property Alpha appraised at $517,000,

and informed Applicant that he qualified for a loan up to $425,000.35 Applicant found a 
water front property (Bravo), and purchased it in March 2005, financed by $385,000, 
including a $100,000 down payment.36 The monthly payments on the loans were about 
$1,200 and $785, respectively, not including taxes or insurance.37 Applicant was 
successful in renting the property to various renters, including local workers and 
vacationers for periods up to one year at a time.38 The property generally rented for 
$1,100 to $1,300 per month.39 The property value increased steadily until late 2008, 
when it reached nearly $600,000.40  
 
When Applicant became unemployed, he received 21 weeks of salary.41 
Consolidating his assets, Applicant sought to sell property Bravo.42 After months of 
negotiations with one would-be purchaser, with a sales price of $446,000, with an 
estimated closing date of June 2007, the transaction fell through.43 Applicant 
subsequently kept reducing the asking price to the lowest in the neighborhood, and 
even pursued short sales, but there were no offers received.44 Although Applicant 
inquired of the lender about short sales, no agreement could be reached.45 Applicant 
stopped making payments. The lender sued on the note and obtained a $289,000 
judgment.46 The estimated value of the property decreased to between $178,973 and 
$182,000 by January 2011.47 Applicant’s attorney and the mortgage lender have 
discussed loan modifications and settlement of the judgment for a substantial period, 
but nothing has yet been resolved.48

In response to an advertisement, Applicant obtained a bank signature loan to 
enable him to install hurricane windows in property Alpha (SOR ¶ 1.d.).49 He was 
offered a reduced interest rate and extended repayment period, and since it made good 
financial sense at the time, he accepted the offer.50 When his financial situation 
deteriorated, Applicant called the bank and attempted to modify the terms of the loan 
but the bank refused to do so.51 He made several attempts to resolve the issue before 
he missed any payments, but his requests were deemed by the bank to be against the 
law.52 Applicant made his last payment in June 2009.53 In October 2009, the bank 
charged off $10,805.54 Nevertheless, several days before the hearing, the bank 
contacted him and offered to settle the account for approximately 30 percent of the 
$10,000.55 Applicant intended to discuss the offer with his attorney, but to date, there 
has been no decision made. 
 
Applicant had a low 12 percent interest bank credit card since 1996, with a credit 
limit of $22,500.56 He turned to it when he needed funds to meet his routine living 
obligations, eventually owing a balance of $23,537 (SOR ¶ 1.a.).57 He made his 
payments until about May 2009, when the bank raised the interest rate on the unpaid 
balance to 29.99 percent.58 Applicant analyzed the financial situation and determined 
that paying 30 percent of the balance was not feasible in light of his other financial 
obligations, especially since the bank refused to offer him any help or resolution.59 
Applicant has authorized his attorney to attempt to negotiate more favorable terms for a 
settlement of the account which is now in collection.60 
 
Applicant purchased property Charlie in June 2007, financed by a $198,000 
mortgage.61 His current mortgage balance is $185,000.62 He leased an automobile in

March 2008, with a monthly payment of $286 over a term of 39 months.63 In October 
2010, Applicant purchased an automobile, financed with a $38,745 loan,64 with a 
monthly payment of $570.65  
 
Applicant has engaged the professional services of two attorneys in an attempt to 
negotiate settlements on the existing delinquent mortgages, loans, and credit cards. 
They have been partially successful, for he had three credit cards with delinquent 
balances totaling $57,594.64 charged off in 2009, and Applicant was issued Forms 
1099-C for the cancelled debts.66 They are continuing their efforts. Applicant would 
prefer retaining property Alpha, while selling property Bravo.67 
 
In August 2010, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
net joint monthly income of $6,346; monthly expenses of $1,547; and debt repayments, 
including mortgage, automobile loan and lease, and credit cards, of $3,085.68 He 
estimated he has a monthly remainder of $1,714 available for discretionary spending.69 
He also listed an asset of $40,000 in 401(k) accounts.70 Applicant claims that of the 
remainder, he is depositing $1,200 per month into their 401(k) accounts.71 
 
Applicant has never received any “formal” financial counseling or debt 
management guidance.72  
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 The senior engineering manager for whom Applicant works, is highly supportive 
of Applicant’s application to retain his security clearance. He noted that Applicant had 
received three certificates of recognition for his work; Applicant had displayed ethical 
integrity; and Applicant had briefed him on all details of both his personal affairs and

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”74 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”75   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”76 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.77  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”78 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”79 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
77 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). 
 
78 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
79 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
10 
                                      
 
                                                          
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until June 2006, when both he and his wife were laid off. At some point 
thereafter, he failed to keep up with his monthly mortgage payments and credit card 
payments, and those accounts started to become delinquent. Some accounts were 
placed for collection, and some accounts were charged off. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”80  
 
Applicant’s initial financial problems commenced in June 2006, when he and his 
wife were laid off. They eventually were both able to obtain new employment, albeit at a 
substantially lower salary. Applicant used his available financial resources, including 
withdrawals from their 401(k)s, his severance package payout, and credit cards, to 
continue to pay various accounts for a substantial period. However, at some point, he 
decided not to pour protected assets into saving his properties and he stopped making 
mortgage payments and credit card payments. A judgment was obtained against him in 
lieu of a foreclosure, and he was unable to sell his distressed properties. The situation is 
still unresolved for Applicant has empowered his attorneys to negotiate favorable 
settlements, but with the exception of three credit card accounts, no resolutions are at 
80 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

hand. Applicant has managed to remain current on other accounts, and even purchased 
a new residence, a new automobile, and leased another automobile, while allowing his 
home mortgages and loans associated with properties Alpha and Bravo unattended. 
Applicant joined his current employer in March 2007. Considering his decision to stop 
making payments in 2009 and his refusal to enter into repayment negotiations other 
than those calling for reduced settlements, his financial problems, related to the 
properties, are likely to continue. Applicant’s decision to retain property Alpha, and 
washing his hands of his responsibilities pertaining to the other accounts, casts doubt 
on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.81 AG ¶ 20(a) only minimally 
applies.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies because there were several conditions, largely 
beyond Applicant’s control, that made a substantial negative effect on Applicant’s 
financial situation. The plummeting housing market caused the value of his properties to 
change dramatically so that his mortgage loans covered properties that were now 
“under water.” That alone could be survivable but for the unprecedented recession 
which basically eliminated potential renters at rental levels sufficient for his mortgage 
payments. Rental payments were essential for Applicant to continue making his monthly 
mortgage payments, especially since both he and his wife were initially laid off before 
obtaining other jobs at substantially reduced salaries. These events were clearly beyond 
Applicant’s control, and Applicant initially acted responsibly to address the debts that 
resulted. However, once he calculated the economic realities and decided not to 
continue using his protected assets to pay the respective accounts associated with the 
properties, and demanded settlements very favorable to him, he failed to act 
responsibly.  
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has never received any financial 
counseling. AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies because Applicant attempted to address his 
delinquent debts before the SOR was issued. Circumstances were such that he was 
initially unable to resolve them all either by settling them or by paying them off, although 
he attempted to do so.82 He has paid off or settled, or otherwise resolved accounts with 
several non-SOR creditors. Applicant used his available financial resources, including 
withdrawals from their 401(k)s, his severance package payout, and credit cards, to 
continue to pay various accounts for a substantial period. However, at some point, he 
decided not to pour protected assets into saving his properties and he stopped making 
mortgage payments and credit card payments. Instead, Applicant purchased property 
Charlie in June 2007, financed by a $198,000 mortgage; he leased an automobile in 
March 2008, with a monthly payment of $286 over a term of 39 months; and in October 
2010, Applicant purchased an automobile, financed with a $38,745 loan, with a monthly

82 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

payment of $570. Instead of continuing to address his delinquent financial 
responsibilities, he directed his attorneys to negotiate settlements favorable to himself, 
rather than entertaining repayment arrangements. And he went on to incur new financial 
obligations. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is substantial evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant 
has a history of financial delinquencies commencing in 2006, when both he and his wife 
were laid off, and were eventually able to obtain employment at salaries substantially 
reduced from that they had been earning before their layoffs. Applicant used his 
available financial resources, including withdrawals from their 401(k)s, his severance 
package payout, and credit cards, to continue to pay various accounts, including his 
mortgages, for a substantial period. He has paid off or settled or otherwise resolved 
accounts with several non-SOR creditors. At some point, however, he permitted the 
SOR accounts to become delinquent and placed for collection or charged off. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is also substantial. 
Applicant’s initial financial delinquencies were the unfortunate consequence of his and 
his wife being laid off from their respective jobs. However, when he decided not to pour 
protected assets into saving his properties, and he stopped making mortgage payments 
and credit card payments, everything changed. Applicant went on to incur new financial 
obligations: he purchased property Charlie in June 2007, financed by a $198,000 
mortgage; he leased an automobile in March 2008, with a monthly payment of $286 
over a term of 39 months; and in October 2010, Applicant purchased an automobile, 
financed with a $38,745 loan, with a monthly payment of $570. Instead of continuing to 
address his delinquent financial responsibilities, he directed his attorneys to negotiate 
settlements favorable to himself, rather than entertaining more reasonable repayment 
arrangements.

I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.83 His initial 
good-faith efforts were substantial, but his subsequent and current efforts are not 
sufficient to mitigate continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) throu
The Appeal Board 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually p

Applicant’s current plan is not to settle or repay, but rather to be relieved of his 
delinquent accounts, with the intention of retaining property Alpha. The evidence in this 
instance is very closely balanced. Nevertheless, overall, the evidence leaves me with 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant
