GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 18, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
Security Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the 
interrogatories on June 18, 2010.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued her 
another set of interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on June 18, 2010.3 
On August 6, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated December 18, 2009. 
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated June 18, 2010).  
 
3 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated June 18, 2010).

Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 26, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on October 8, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated 
the Government was prepared to proceed on November 10, 2010, and the case was 
assigned to me on February 2, 2011. A Notice of Hearing was issued on March 2, 2011, 
and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on March 24, 2011.4 
 
 During the hearing, 8 Government exhibits (GE 1-8) and 26 Applicant exhibits 
(AE A-AB, there was no exhibit M) were admitted into evidence, some without objection, 
and other’s over objection. Applicant testified. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received 
on April 1, 2011. The record was kept open, initially until April 5, 2011, and 
subsequently until May 20, 2011, to enable Applicant to supplement the record. 
Applicant took advantage of those opportunities and she submitted four additional 
exhibits which were admitted into evidence (AE AC-AF) without objection. 
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
During the hearing, Applicant requested that I take administrative notice of 
certain enumerated facts pertaining to the economy and the local housing market, 
appearing in three Internet articles or blogs. Department Counsel objected. In response 
to my post-hearing Order that the objection had been sustained, Applicant submitted 
two publications of the U.S. Government, erroneously referred to by her as exhibits, but 
in actuality, materials meant to furnish certain enumerated facts pertaining to the 
economy and regulatory actions related to foreclosure activities. One was a publication 
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (“Supervisory Insights – 
Regulatory Actions Related to Foreclosure Activities by Large Servicers and Practical 
Implications for Community Banks,” dated May 2011) and the other from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, Monthly Labor Review (“The U.S. Housing Bubble and Bust: Impacts 
on Employment,” dated December 2010). Department Counsel did not object. Facts are 
proper for administrative notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source 
and relevant and material to the case. After weighing the reliability of the source 
4 It apparently took one week for the Notice of Hearing to reach Applicant. As she was made telephonically 
aware of the hearing date before the issuance of the official notice, Applicant expressly waived the 15-day notice 
requirement. See Tr. at 17.

documentation and assessing the relevancy and materiality of the facts initially 
proposed by Applicant, pursuant to Rule 201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I declined to 
take administrative notice of certain facts as they appear in the three articles or blogs, 
but I have agreed to do so as to the two U.S. Government publications.5 Moreover, 
while I did reject the specific facts set forth in the blogs, I shall take administrative notice 
of facts regarding the economy in general and the housing market in general, as well as 
material and relevant facts pertaining to the regulatory actions related to foreclosures 
and the U.S. housing bubble and bust. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the sole factual allegation (¶ 1.a.) 
of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
an administrative assistant.6 She is seeking to retain a secret security clearance with 
access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI).7 A 1978 high school graduate,8 
Applicant completed one year of college before dropping out to get married in May 
1980,9 and attended a community college for three months in 1987.10 Applicant joined 
her current employer in January 1986.11 She has never served in the U.S. military.12 
 
Applicant and her first husband had three children, a son (born in May 1982) and 
twin daughters (born in May 1983).13 Applicant and her first husband divorced in July 
5 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See 
McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 
n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 
at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice 
facts that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 
(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may 
utilize authoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) 
(citing internet sources for numerous documents). Tr. at 51-59.

1985.14 She married her second husband in November 1990, and they were divorced in 
July 2004.15  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until the local economy 
and the local housing market deteriorated some time during 2005-06. Applicant is the 
owner of three properties. After her divorce from her second husband, their residence 
was sold, and with some of the proceeds from that sale, she purchased the first 
property (property A) in December 2004, for $120,000.16 She financed $100,000.17 
Over the course of two to three years, Applicant resided in property A, off and on, going 
between property A and her parents’ residence.18 Applicant’s son rented the property 
and he resided there with his wife and son for about one year until they separated.19 At 
some point in 2009, property A became empty, and with Applicant unable to make her 
mortgage payments, property A went into a foreclosure status.20 Applicant received an 
escrow refund of $2,613.26 in December 2009, and she applied those funds, as well as 
some of her 401(k) funds to the unpaid mortgage balance.21 The mortgage is currently 
up-to-date, and the property was removed from foreclosure status.22 Property A is 
rented by a low-income family with five children23 with subsidies under the U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Housing Choice Voucher 
Program called Section 8.24 The property is not for sale.25 
 
With some of the proceeds from the sale of her former marital residence, as well 
as from the sale of a townhouse she retained as part of her divorce, and with an 
inheritance from her father’s estate, Applicant purchased the second property (property

B) in July 2005, and financed it for $238,540.26 Applicant resided in property B for a little 
over two years.27 The developer went into foreclosure, and his homeowner’s 
association (HOA) dues were not being paid. As a result, the HOA dues for the property 
owners, including Applicant, were increased.28 Applicant’s monthly HOA dues are 
$405.29 When issues occurred involving another property (property C), to be discussed 
further below, Applicant decided to sell property B. No potential purchasers ever looked 
at property B.30 While monthly mortgage payments may have been periodically delayed, 
property B did not enter a foreclosure status. Applicant applied some of her 401(k) 
funds to eliminate the delinquencies.31 In February 2010, Applicant finally rented 
property B and took the house off the market.32 The tenant paid a monthly rent of 
$1,300, which was about $118 or $120 less than Applicant’s mortgage payments.33 A 
new tenant, effective April 1, 2011, will pay $1,400 monthly rent.34 The mortgage is 
currently up-to-date, and property 35
 
The SOR identified only one continuing delinquency, a mortgage for a townhouse 
identified as property C. Applicant purchased property C in December 2005, for 
$250,000,36 with a down payment of $70,000 derived from the sale of another 
property.37 The townhouse was intended as a residence in a safe area for her twin 
daughters to live alone while they attended school and worked.38 Applicant’s daughters 
paid rent sufficient to cover the mortgage payment,39 and remained in property C until 
2008. The incomes of Applicant’s daughters were reduced so they were forced to scale 
back their expenses. At some point in 2007, they could no longer afford to pay the rent, 
and Applicant placed property C on the market.40 Property C has been for sale and for

rent since 2007,41 but except for a period when Applicant’s son occupied the 
townhouse, or Applicant had someone else stay there to keep the townhouse clean and 
presentable for possible showings, it has remained empty.42 Applicant kept reducing the 
sale price,43 and sought approval from the mortgage lender for potential short sales, 
and while the property was shown to potential buyers, and there were offers, the 
mortgage lender took too long to act on offers, and the buyers withdrew their offers.44 
As with her other two properties, Applicant continued paying the townhouse mortgage 
by using funds from her 401(k), but eventually she could not keep doing so for the 
townhouse.45 She exhausted all of her assets in trying to keep the mortgage current.46

property and engaged the services of another realtor to give t

Applicant engaged the services of an attorney in November 2008 to discuss 
possible options pertaining to property C.48 At that time it was decided that a short sale 
would be the best option since Applicant had indicated a desire to avoid foreclosure.49 A 
number of short sale offers were given to the mortgage lender, a Troubled Asset Relief 
Program (TARP) recipient, but in the words of Applicant’s attorney, the mortgage lender 
“has been a nightmare to communicate and work with.”50 The mortgage lender refused 
to accept more than one offer at a time, essentially ignoring back-up offers.51 It also 
took a substantial period for the mortgage lender to either reject or accept offers, in one 
instance taking nine months to accept the only offer it eventually accepted up to that 
time.52 The characterization of the mortgage lender by Applicant’s attorney is supported 
by the conclusions of the regulatory review conducted by the various federal banking 
agencies and subsequent Consent Orders by and between those agencies and certain 
national banks, including the mortgage lender herein. The Consent Orders were 
designed to remedy the numerous matters requiring attention, including unsafe or

in the amount of $120,000 was made on July 9, 2009;55 another offer in the amount of 
$125,000 was made on September 18, 2009;56 another offer in the amount of $91,500 
was made on September 10, 2010;57 and another offer in the amount of $104,000 was 
made in December 2010.58 While awaiting a mortgage lender decision on one offer, the 
mortgage lender filed for foreclosure on property C, but the process server attempted to 
serve the complaint at an address unconnected to Applicant.59 Applicant’s attorney 
contended the plaintiff in the foreclosure action cannot prove evidence of standing to 
bring the action.60 The attorney also commented that Applicant “had no control of the 
real estate market crash and the fraudulent banking transactions.”61 The September 
2009 offer was finally accepted nine months later by the mortgage lender with a closing 
date scheduled for June 2010, but the buyer was unhappy with the inspection results 
and could not wait for the decision. He withdrew the offer. As of September 29, 2010, 
Applicant’s mortgage balance was $185,851.43, with a past due amount of 
$49,203.54.62 The December offer was finally accepted on February 28, 2011, and was 
supposed to close on April 15, 2011.63 The buyer apparently had some issues with his

In December 2010, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting 
a net monthly income, including rental income, of $3,641.67; and monthly expenses, 
including mortgage payments, of $3,195.67 She estimated she has a monthly remainder 
of $446.67 available for discretionary spending.68 In May 2011, Applicant submitted an 
updated version of her personal financial statement reflecting a net monthly income, 
including rental income, of $4,594.44; and monthly expenses, including mortgage 
payments and repayment of 401(k) loans, of over $7,000.69 It is unclear if Applicant’s 
expenses are actual or projected. 
 
Applicant has altered her lifestyle. She no longer shops at the mall, but rather at 
the thrift shop, and she has closed all of her accounts. She no longer has any credit 
cards in her name, but uses a debit card associated with her bank account.70 Applicant 
has only one delinquent account, and that is the mortgage on property C.71 
 
Civilian Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Applicant’s overall performance assessments over the past eight years reflect an 
individual who is normally a successful contributor and, on occasion, a high 
contributor.72 She is described as being dedicated, loyal, trusted, trustworthy, 
respected, mission-oriented, and motivated.73 Her supervisor noted in her 2010 
assessment: “I have valued [Applicant’s] support and “Do what it takes to succeed”

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”75 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”76   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”77 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.78  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,

relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”79 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”80 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations” may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until the local economy and the local housing market deteriorated some time 
during 2005-06. She found it difficult to keep up with her monthly mortgage payments 
and, at some point, stopped making them. As of September 29, 2010, Applicant’s 
mortgage balance was $185,851.43, with a past due amount of $49,203.54. Property C

is currently in a disputed foreclosure status awaiting mortgage lender approval of a 
short sale. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”81  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) apply. Applicant’s initial financial problems commenced 
when the local economy and the local housing market burst some time during 2005-06. 
As the owner of three properties, she had previously been able to maintain renters in 
her properties. The rent received each month enabled her to make her mortgage 
payments and save for future investments. As the economy continued to deteriorate, 
the ability of her renters, including her daughters, to keep up with the monthly payments 
also evaporated. Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. She scrambled 
to find renters, or buyers, but the plummeting economy was such that there simply were 
none. She reduced the asking prices for both sale and rent. Applicant continued paying 
her mortgages by using funds from her 401(k), but eventually she could not keep doing 
so for property C. She exhausted all of her assets in trying to keep that mortgage 
current. 
 
Property A is now rented by a low-income family with subsidies under the HUD 
Section 8 program. Property B is rented. The mortgages of both property A and property 
B are up-to-date.  Property C, the sole focus of the SOR, is in a disputed foreclosure 
status, awaiting another approval of a short sale by the mortgage lender. The 
81 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

unprecedented decline in the housing market was not due to anything Applicant had 
done. She was merely one of the many innocent victims of the housing market 
correction. Applicant’s financial difficulties were largely beyond her control, and 
occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt 
on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.82  
 
AG & 20(c) partially applies. While Applicant has never received any “financial 
counseling” related to debt management, debt repayment, etc., she did seek guidance 
and real estate counseling from two licensed real estate agents and an attorney in 
handling her real estate difficulties. She followed their guidance and finally repaired two-
thirds of her real estate difficulties, returning property A and property B to financial 
stability. Property C remains her only unresolved issue. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) applies. Well before the SOR was issued, Applicant was addressing 
her financial difficulties with all of her properties. She has continued her aggressive 
efforts to restore her real estate portfolio to financial stability. She scrambled to find 
renters, or buyers; she reduced the asking prices for both sale and rent; she continued 
paying her mortgages by using funds from her 401(k); and she exhausted all of her 
assets in trying to keep the mortgage on property C current. Her continuing experiences 
with the mortgage lender have been exhausting. Various short sale offers, from $91,500 
to $125,000, were received by Applicant and promptly submitted to the mortgage 
lender, only to face lengthy delays in processing. In a business were timeliness is 
important, Applicant was faced with one delay that lasted for nine months before the 
decision was made. In that instance, the decision came too late. Circumstances may 
have been such that Applicant was unable to resolve all three of her mortgages by 
bringing them up-to-date, but she did do so with two of the properties. Her failure with 
respect to property C was not for lack of trying.83  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
82 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
83 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She has one mortgage 
which, as of September 29, 2010, had a balance of $185,851.43, with a past due 
amount of $49,203.54. The property is currently in a disputed foreclosure status. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s initial financial problems commenced when the local economy and the local 
housing market burst some time during 2005-06. She scrambled to find renters, or 
buyers; she reduced the asking prices for both sale and rent; she continued paying her 
mortgages by using funds from her 401(k); and she exhausted all of her assets in trying 
to keep the mortgage on property C current. Her continuing experiences with the 
mortgage lender have been exhausting. Various short sale offers, from $91,500 to 
$125,000, were received by Applicant and promptly submitted to the mortgage lender, 
only to face lengthy delays in processing. This problem was identified in the FDIC 
publication as an example of “inadequate organization and staffing of foreclosure units 
to address the increased volumes of foreclosures” and “weaknesses in quality control 
and internal auditing procedures.” These practices by the mortgage lender were not 
Applicant’s fault, for she was merely a victim of the process. Applicant has been unable 
to resolve all three of her mortgages by bringing them up-to-date, but she did do so with 
two of the properties. And her efforts pertaining to the remaining property have been 
unrelenting. 
 
I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the 
record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.84 Applicant’s 
continuing good-faith efforts have been extensive, and are sufficient to mitigate 
continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:85 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
84 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant’s current plan is to eventually resolve her only delinquent mortgage, 
and she has repeatedly made efforts to do so. She has resolved her two non-SOR 
mortgages, but has been, to date, unable to resolve the remaining property C mortgage. 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
         
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
