ANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: 
 
 After a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I conclude that 
Applicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government’s security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations, and the whole-person concept. His eligibility for a security 
clearance is denied. 
 
                                      Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP) on May 15, 2009. On June 23, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the 
security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
 
2 
 
 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the 
Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  
  
 Applicant replied to the SOR on September 9, 2010. However, he did not admit 
or deny the individual SOR allegations. On December 3, 2010, in response to DOHA’s 
direction, he answered the SOR in writing and specifically addressed five of the six 
allegations. He asked to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was 
assigned to me on February 8, 2011. On February 14, 2011, a Notice of Hearing was 
issued, scheduling Applicant’s hearing for March 2, 2011. On February 16, 2011, DOHA 
issued an amended Notice of Hearing, setting Applicant’s hearing for March 9, 2011. I 
convened a hearing, as scheduled, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
 
The Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which were 
marked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified 
and called no witnesses. He introduced seven exhibits, which were marked as Ex. A 
through G. Applicant’s exhibits were admitted to the record without objection. At the 
conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open for one calendar week, until March 16, 
2011, so that Applicant could submit additional information. Applicant timely filed three 
additional documents. I marked the documents as Applicant’s Ex. H, Ex. I, and Ex. J, 
and they were admitted to the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript of 
the hearing on March 17, 2011. 
 
Procedural Matters 
 
The Government noted that two of the SOR allegations were identified as 1.e. 
and proposed a technical amendment to designate the second SOR allegation 1.e. as 
SOR allegation 1.f. The SOR was thus amended without objection. 
 
     Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial 
Considerations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.f.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted 
the allegation at ¶ 1.d. He denied the allegations at ¶¶ 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., and 1.f. He 
neither admitted nor denied the allegation at ¶ 1.c. He also provided additional 
information. Applicant’s admission is included as a finding of fact. (SOR; Answer to 
SOR.) 
 
 Applicant is 43 years old. He has a high school education. After high school, he 
enlisted in the U.S. military and served on active duty from 1985 until 1991, when he 
received an honorable discharge. He was first awarded a security clearance in 1985. 
(Ex. 1; Tr. 23-25.) 
 
 Applicant is president and chief executive officer of an internet technology (IT) 
services consulting firm, which he founded in 1994. He owns 79% of the company, 
which is a corporation. Under the rules controlling the organization of the corporation, 
 
3 
 
 
8, 58-64.) 
                                           
Applicant is an employee. The company currently has about 50 employees. Applicant 
seeks a security clearance and authorization for a facility clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 25-27, 
51-53, 129-131, 153-154.) 
 
 Applicant is currently married.1 He has been previously married and divorced 
twice.2 He has a 20-year-old son from his first marriage and an 8-year-old daughter 
from his second marriage. His older child and his mother live in a European country, 
and the younger child lives with her mother in the United States. Applicant pays child 
support to the mother of his younger child. (Ex. 1; Ex. A; Tr. 27-2
 
 Applicant purchased a four-unit apartment house as an investment property. The 
property went into foreclosure in 2005, and Applicant owed $110,000 to a mortgage 
lender. Several years ago, Applicant contacted the lender to inquire about any liability 
he might have. The lender did not reply, and Applicant did not pursue the matter further. 
He assumes he no longer owes a debt on the foreclosed property. (Ex. 5 at 9; Tr. 81-82, 
135-137.) 
 
 The SOR alleges at ¶ 1.a. that Applicant owes $13,200 on a delinquent child 
support account. This debt is listed on Applicant’s credit report of May 5, 2010.3 In his 
December 3, 2010, Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation and asserted 
that he had sent his child support payments directly to his second ex-wife. He stated 
that he did not know he was required to send his child support payments to the state 
office of child support. He also stated that he had contacted the state office of child 
support, provided documentation to corroborate his direct payments to his second ex-
wife, and had been told that his direct payments would be credited in the state system. 
At his hearing, Applicant provided documentation from the state child support office 
stating that he was compliant with his child support court order. Applicant also provided 
a payment history showing he had made his required child support payments of $2,200 
each month from September 2010 through February 2011. (Ex. A; Ex. 4; Tr. 31-32, 83-
91.) 
 
 The SOR alleges at ¶ 1.b. that Applicant owed a household alarm business $271 
on a delinquent debt in collection status. This debt is listed on Applicant’s credit report 
of May 2009 and dates to 2007. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt 
but said he would pay it if he owed it. At his hearing, Applicant claimed that he had 
 
1 When Applicant completed his e-QIP in May 2009, he listed his marital status as divorced. At his 
hearing he acknowledged that he divorced his second wife in March 2006 and married his third wife in 
August 2006. He also stated that he and his third wife separated in 2007, and he no longer lives with her 
in a marital relationship. He stated that he and his third wife have not divorced, have a friendly 
relationship, and the third wife owns 10% of his company. (Ex. 1; Tr. 58-61, 144.) 
 
2 Applicant was married to his first wife from 1987 to 1997. He married his second wife 1998. The couple 
separated in about 2003. Divorce negotiations were contentious. (Ex. 1; Tr. 28-29.) 
  
3 Applicant provided a credit report dated October 4, 2010, showing that he was 120 days past due in 
paying his child support and owed a balance of $15,400. (Ex. B at 9.)  
 
4 
 
 
                                           
disputed the debt, and it had been dropped from his credit report. He provided a copy of 
his credit report to show that the debt was no longer listed. Applicant stated that he had 
not received a response from the credit bureau company to his dispute letter. However, 
he concluded that the alleged debt had been dropped in response to his dispute letter. 
(Ex. 2; Tr. 33-34, 91-93.) 
 
 The SOR alleges at ¶ 1.c. that Applicant owed a tax lien to State A for $55,744, 
entered against him in August 2007. While Applicant neither admitted nor denied this 
debt, I construe his non-responsiveness as a denial. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) 
 
 In response to allegation 1.c., Applicant provided a letter from a certified public 
accountant (CPA) he had retained to address the State A tax lien. The CPA reported 
Applicant was challenging the amount of the tax lien, which assessed Applicant $25,456 
(excluding interest) for tax year 2001, $2,554 (excluding interest) for tax year 2004, and 
$8,690 (excluding interest) for tax year 2005. According to the CPA, Applicant denied 
owing state income taxes to State A for tax year 2001 and part of 2002 because he 
claimed he lived in State B during that time.4 Since he denied any liability to State A for 
tax year 2001, Applicant asserted that he owed only $11,244 to State A for tax years 
2004 and 2005. (Ex. C; Tr. 35-38.) 
 
 In a post-hearing submission, Applicant submitted unsigned joint Federal and 
State B tax returns for himself and his second wife for 2001. On both returns Applicant 
and his wife listed their residence as in State A. Nothing in either return identifies a 
residence or period of residence in State B. The records provided by Applicant suggest 
that neither the Federal nor the State B returns were actually signed and filed.5 
Applicant asserted that he filed his 2004 and 2005 state taxes in 2006. (Ex. I; Tr. 99-
105.) 
 
 The SOR alleges at ¶ 1.d. that Applicant owes a federal tax debt of $47,025 to 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The tax debt covered tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 
and 2006. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt and stated that he had 
entered into a payment plan with the IRS to resolve the debt. At his hearing, he 
provided documentation to establish that he had made all required payments under the 
payment plan. (SOR; Answer to SOR; Ex. D; Tr. 39-41, 106-110.) 
 
 The SOR alleges at ¶ 1.e. that Applicant owes a $1,858 judgment debt, filed 
against him in 2006 by a homeowners’ association, and the debt remains unsatisfied. In 
his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt and stated that under the terms of   
his divorce agreement with his second wife, the debt was her responsibility. At his 
 
4 When he filed his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he resided in State B from January 1999 to January 
2001. He confirmed these dates during his June 2009 personal subject interview. He also stated that he 
resided in State A from January 2001 to December 2003. (Ex. 1 at 12; Ex. 5 at 12.) 
 
5 A cover letter from another CPA firm, dated July 9, 2010, advised Applicant and his wife to sign and 
mail their 2001 federal return on or before September 30, 2002, and to sign and mail their 2001 State B 
return on or before November 1, 2002. (Ex. I at 1.)

hearing, Applicant stated that he and his second wife agreed to divide the judgment 
debt and each would pay half. At his hearing, he admitted that he had reviewed his 
credit reports over the last two years and knew about the judgment against him. He 
provided a document, dated March 7, 2011, memorializing the agreement and signed 
by Applicant and his second wife on March 8, 2011. The agreement acknowledged that 
Applicant had paid his half of the debt to his second wife, and she would then pay her 
half of the debt. (Ex. E; Tr. 42-44, 110-115.) 
 
    The SOR alleged at ¶ 1.f. that Applicant owed a $4,400 judgment debt, filed 
against him in October 2006, and the judgment debt remained unsatisfied. In his 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the debt. At his hearing, Applicant admitted that 
the debt arose when he sold a home in 2005 or 2006 and the equity in the home was 
not sufficient to satisfy title fees. Applicant stated that he entered into an agreement with 
the creditor to satisfy the debt with monthly payments from his credit card. He could not 
remember how much he agreed to pay the creditor each month. However, Applicant 
stated that he lost his wallet containing the credit card used to pay the debt, and the 
payments were stopped. At his hearing, he provided a document from the creditor’s 
representative acknowledging full payment of the debt on March 7, 2011. (Ex. F; Tr. 45, 
115-118.) 
 
 Applicant acknowledged that his financial practices had led to debts which have 
remained unsatisfied over a long period of time. He attributed his delays in resolving his 
delinquent debts in part to his second wife, who was not cooperative in resolving their 
joint financial obligations. He also stated that he was poorly served by a CPA and by 
certain employees in his company. He replaced the CPA and fired the employees he 
concluded were carrying out bad financial practices. He stated that he intended to 
address financial issues in a more timely manner in the future. (Tr. 47-51.) 
 
 During his hearing, Applicant often had difficulty remembering financial matters 
with accuracy. For example, he did not know how long he had been paying his federal 
income tax lien. He didn’t remember whether he had delinquent debts when he was in 
the military or before he started his own business. He was not sure if he had any current 
outstanding debts.  (Tr. 39-40, 56, 123.) 
 
 In a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided information on his yearly 
income from 2001 to 2010. He compiled this information from his W-2 forms. In 2001, 
his yearly income was $289,492; in 2002, $150,021; in 2003, $111,476; in 2004, 
$81,482; in 2005, $130,345; in 2006, $179,863; in 2007, $173,539; in 2008, $195,218; 
in 2009, $193,537; and in 2010, $155,969. Applicant also provided proof that he filed his 
2008 federal income taxes. (Ex. H; Ex. J.) 
 
 At his hearing, Applicant provided a personal financial statement. He reported a 
net monthly income of $26,381. His monthly living expenses are as follows: rent, 
$4,000; groceries, $500; clothing, $1,000; utilities, $1,500; car expenses, $400; life and 
other insurance, $120; child support, $2,200; and miscellaneous (entertainment, 
transportation, etc.), $2,800. (Ex. G.) 
 
6 
 
 
 On his personal financial statement, Applicant identified two financial obligations: 
$47,000 to the IRS and $28,882 to State A. He reported he paid $1,500 each month to 
the IRS to satisfy his federal tax debt. He reported that he had not yet arrived at a 
payment plan with State A. Applicant’s net monthly remainder is $10,920. (Ex. G.)  
 
 Applicant reported the following assets: a real estate interest valued at $100,000; 
bank savings, $71,000; automobiles and boats, $40,000, miscellaneous, $10,000. 
Applicant has not had financial counseling. (Ex. G; Ex. 5 at 9-10.) 
 
                                                 Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and 
it has emphasized that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the 
Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at 
527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, an 
administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition 
to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list 
potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on 
the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
 
7 
 
 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns.   
 
Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt. Despite a substantial income, 
he did not pay his creditors for several years. This evidence is sufficient to raise  
potentially disqualifying conditions under Guideline F. 
 
The guideline includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions 
could apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant’s financial delinquencies. If the 
 
8 
 
 
financially delinquent behavior “happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” then AG ¶ 20(a) might 
apply.  If “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the 
person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” then AG ¶ 20(b) might apply.  If “the person has received or 
is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control,” then AG ¶ 20(c) might apply.  If “the 
individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts,” then AG ¶ 20(d) might apply.  Finally, if “the individual has a reasonable basis to 
dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and 
provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence 
of actions to resolve the issue,” then AG ¶ 20(e) might apply. 
 
While Applicant’s second divorce was contentious, his failure to resolve debts 
that grew out of the marriage cannot be seen as a reasonable response to 
circumstances that were stressful or beyond his control. He had the resources to pay or 
otherwise resolve his delinquent debts, but he failed to do so for several years. 
Applicant’s financial delinquencies involved substantial sums of money, occurred under 
circumstances that are likely to recur, and cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
 
Applicant provided documentation establishing that he was not in arrears in 
paying child support and had satisfied a federal tax debt. He disputed one debt and 
provided supporting documentation. His dispute with State A over his tax lien is 
ongoing. He paid or settled two debts the day before his hearing. However, despite a 
monthly net remainder of over $10,000, it is not clear that he has a plan in place for 
avoid financial delinquency in the future. While Applicant’s recent actions to satisfy his 
creditors have some merit, he has failed to demonstrate a track record of financial 
responsibility. He has not yet demonstrated priorities that emphasize paying his debts 
and avoiding additional financial delinquencies in the future. Moreover, his 
inattentiveness to his financial situation raises concerns. While I conclude that AG ¶¶ 
20(d) and 20(e) apply in part to the facts of Applicant’s case, I also conclude that AG ¶¶ 
20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) do not apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
9 
 
 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is financially 
successful and leads a business. He seeks a security clearance. However, he has failed 
to address his financial responsibilities for many years, even though he had the financial 
resources to do so. While he presented documentation supporting payment of the 
majority of the debts alleged on the SOR, he failed to demonstrate that he possessed 
good judgment in managing his financial obligations.  
 
I have reviewed the record, and I observed Applicant carefully at his hearing. I 
conclude that his assertions that he did not live in State A in tax year 2001 lack 
credibility.   
 
Applicant has addressed some of his delinquent debts only recently. His financial 
problems began when he was a mature adult. He has failed to demonstrate that he 
understands how to avoid excessive debt in the future. His long-term financial 
delinquencies raise concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. 
  
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present 
time as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I 
conclude, after a careful review of the facts of his case, the financial considerations 
adjudicative guideline, and the whole-person analysis, that Applicant failed to mitigate 
the security concerns arising from his financial delinquencies.     
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
            Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST  APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. - 1.b.:              For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.c.:                        Against  Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.d. -1.f.:   For Applicant 
 
 
10 
 
 
                                                Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
