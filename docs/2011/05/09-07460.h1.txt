FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on May 28, 2009. On 
September 21, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his 
application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on September 29, 2010; answered it on October 26, 
2010; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the 
request on October 27, 2010. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 1, 
 
2 
 
 
2011, and the case was assigned to me on January 13, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of 
hearing on February 10, 2011, scheduling it for March 2, 2011. DOHA issued an 
amended notice of hearing on February 17, 2011, rescheduling the hearing for March 
14, 2011, and changing the venue. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection, and a 
demonstrative exhibit summarizing the Government evidence was attached to the 
record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of one 
witness, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A and B, which were admitted without 
objection. I kept the record open until March 31, 2011, to enable Applicant to submit 
additional documentary evidence. At his telephonic request, I extended the deadline 
until April 15, 2011. He timely submitted AX C through G, which were admitted without 
objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX C through G are attached to 
the record as HX II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 22, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His 
admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 53-year-old machinist employed by a defense contractor. He has 
worked for his current employer since February 2009. He has never held a security 
clearance. 
 
 Applicant worked in a casino from August 2001 to June 2007, when he was 
separated for excessive absenteeism caused by medical problems. He worked for 
another casino from June to December 2007 and then for a construction company from 
December 2007 to July 2008. He was laid off from his construction job and unemployed 
from July 2008 until he began his current job. (Tr. 31-32.) 
 
 Applicant married in September 1977 and divorced in June 1998. He married his 
current spouse in November 2004. His current spouse has an adult daughter. Applicant 
has no children from his marriages. His wife’s daughter and two children live with him in 
a two-bedroom apartment. (Tr. 58-59.) 
 
Applicant’s net monthly pay is about $1,900, and his wife’s net monthly pay is 
about $1,200. His stepdaughter is not employed outside the home. (Tr. 29, 32-33.) His 
stepdaughter receives child support payments of $50 per week for each child. (Tr. 38.) 
After paying all his bills, he has a net monthly remainder of about $180. (Tr. 41; GX 3 at 
11.) He drives a 16-year-old car that is debt free, and his wife drives a four-year-old 
economy car for which they are paying about $400 per month. 
 
 Applicant disclosed numerous delinquent debts on his security clearance 
application. The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $17,500. His largest 
delinquent debt is a deficiency of $13,930 after a car repossession. 
 
 
3 
 
 
 Applicant admitted the car repossession debt in his answer to the SOR, but he 
disputed it at the hearing. In June 2010, he responded to DOHA financial interrogatories 
about the status of this debt by attaching a letter from the creditor reciting that he and 
the creditor had agreed to a payment schedule of $100 per month. (GX 2 at 3.) At the 
hearing, he testified that he was never notified of any deficiency after the car was 
repossessed, that he never received any demands for payment, that the debt does not 
appear on his recent credit report, and that he has been advised by a lawyer that 
collection is barred by the statute of limitations. (Tr. 25-27; AX A; AX B.)  
 
Applicant admitted all the other debts alleged in the SOR. He testified that he has 
contacted all the creditors alleged in the SOR but has been unable to negotiate 
payment arrangements with any of them. (Tr. 35-36.) He presented evidence that he 
had made small payments on two debts and settled one, but he did not present any 
documentation of his efforts regarding the eight other delinquent debts. 
 
 The table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts 
alleged in the SOR.

 Applicant’s father-in-law testified that Applicant loves his job. He described 
Applicant as a “decent guy” who is “always helping everybody.” (Tr. 65-66.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
 
4 
 
 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in 
conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts. The security concern under this guideline 
is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and his credit reports establish three disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”), 
AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 19(e) (“consistent 
spending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, 
significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial 
analysis”). Thus, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
the facts established by the evidence. 
 
“A security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an 
applicant’s personal debts. Rather, a security clearance adjudication is a proceeding 
aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in order to 
make a decision about an applicant’s security eligibility.” ISCR Case No. 09-02160 
(App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) 
 
 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This mitigating 
condition is not established, because Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, 
recent, and did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant experienced a marital 
breakup in 1998, but the debts alleged in the SOR did not become delinquent until 
several years later. Applicant’s largest debt, arising from the repossession, became 
delinquent in 2003 after he bought a car he could not afford. His unemployment in July 
2008 occurred well after his debts were already delinquent, except the medical debt 
 
6 
 
 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b and the cell phone bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. I conclude AG ¶ 20(b) 
is not established. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). This 
mitigating condition is not established because there is no evidence that Applicant has 
sought or received financial counseling. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of 
law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only 
establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement 
the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent 
debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be 
paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  
 
 Applicant has settled the cell phone bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, and he has made 
small payments on the telephone bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a and the cable bill alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.d. He has no clear plan to resolve the other debts alleged in the SOR and has 
not taken any significant action to resolve them. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is 
established for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, but it is not established for 
the other debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). At the 
hearing, Applicant disputed the deficiency due on the automobile repossession, on the 
ground that he was not contacted and notified of the deficiency and on the ground that 
the statute of limitations has run. This assertion is contradicted by the letter from the 
creditor in May 2010, reciting that Applicant and the creditor had agreed to a payment 
arrangement of $100 per month. The fact that the debt is uncollectable under state law 
does not affect the legitimacy of the debt or its relevance to Applicant’s suitability for a 
security clearance. See ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). I 
conclude that AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
7 
 
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is an intelligent, mature adult, but he has neglected his financial 
obligations for many years. The SOR reflects delinquent debts dating back to 2003 and 
2004. He is living frugally, but he is overwhelmed by the magnitude of his indebtedness 
and unable to formulate a realistic plan to overcome it.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:     Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.d:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1-k:    Against Applicant 
 
 
8 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
