HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists 18 delinquent debts totaling 
$168,493. In August 2006, Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for 
2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. He owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
about $100,000 and the state tax authorities about $40,000. He paid six SOR debts; 
however, he did not make sufficient progress resolving his other SOR debts. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 18, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86). (GE 1) On 
November 30, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) 
 
On December 22, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On February 11, 2011, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On February 2, 2011, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case to 
me. On March 10, 2011, Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered 11 exhibits (GE 1-11 and HE 4, a demonstrative exhibit) (Tr. 18), and 
Applicant offered 61 pages of documentation. (Tr. 20; pg. 1-61) There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-11 and pg. 1-61. (Tr. 18-20) Additionally, I admitted the 
hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR as hearing exhibits. (HE 1-3) 
After the hearing, Applicant provided 17 additional pages of documents, which were 
admitted without objection. (pg. 62-79) On April 11, 2011, I received the transcript.  I 
attached tax information to the record from the IRS and Applicant’s state of residence. 
(HE 5, 6) 
 
Procedural Ruling 
 
 Department Counsel made a motion to withdraw SOR ¶ 1.j because it was 
encompassed or included in SOR ¶ 1.f. (Tr. 15) Applicant did not object, and I granted 
Department Counsel’s motion. (Tr. 15-16)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 
1.k, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.r. He denied several debts because they were paid, duplications, or 
disputed. He also provided extenuating or mitigating information about his financial 
situation and all of his SOR debts. His admissions are accepted as factual findings.

month child support for his seven-year-old son. (Tr. 65-67; GE 1) 
  
Applicant held two full time jobs from 1997 until 2002. (Tr. 22) In 2002, he was 
laid off from one job. (Tr. 23) In 2003, He was rehired, and laid off from the other job.

(Tr. 23) In 2004, he was laid off again. (Tr. 23) He was unemployed from June 2004 to 
January 2005. (Tr. 23) From August 2005 to the present, he has been employed by the 
same major defense contractor in computer repair. (Tr. 24) From about December 2006 
to January 2008, he had a full-time job as a security guard. (Tr. 25-26) His current 
annual salary is approximately $51,500. (Tr. 25) He also receives $1,280 retirement pay 
for his Air Force active duty service, after $400 is deducted for his former spouse. (Tr. 
25)  
  
Financial Considerations 
 
On his October 18, 2005 SF 86, Applicant disclosed garnishment of his wages or 
repossession of his property and one judgment in 2003 for a delinquent credit card in 
the amount of $3,000. (GE 1 at 21-23) He also disclosed a delinquent loan for $2,500, 
which he said he satisfied in July 2005. (GE 1 at 23-24) He said, “[t]he financial debts 
incurred because my ex-wife and I agreed to pay certain debts and when we divorced, 
she did not pay her portion[; however,] I was the person who was the primary on the 
accounts.” (GE 1 at 25) 
 
Applicant’s SOR listed 18 debts totaling $168,493 as follows: (a) IRS debt 
($100,436); (b) 2010 state tax lien ($2,685); (c) 2008 state tax lien ($2,679); (d) 2007 
state tax lien ($35,057); (e) telephone debt ($350); (f) judgment for credit card ($7,001); 
(g) garnishment for bank debt ($2,349); (h) collection debt ($1,502); (i) 2005 state tax 
lien ($1,727); (j) collection account for bank debt in 1.f ($5,109) (withdrawn by 
Department Counsel); (k) telecommunications debt ($605); (l) automobile collection 
debt ($7,151); (m) collection debt ($510); (n) collection debt ($350); (o) 
telecommunications collection debt ($99); (p) medical collection debt ($50); (q) medical 
collection debt ($50); and (r) collection debt ($783).     
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is an IRS debt for $100,436—Inadequate Payment Plan. On 
August 21, 2006, Applicant filed his tax returns for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 
2005. (pg. 2-7) All of his tax returns are filed. (Tr. 36) He blamed his “tax guy” for not 
filing his taxes, and for advising him to keep his exemptions high so that a minimal 
amount of money was withheld from his salary from one of his jobs. (Tr. 29-31) Without 
including interest and penalties, his total tax underpayment for those six years was 
$43,616. (Tr. 68-70; pg. 2-7)

On March 7, 2010, the IRS rejected Applicant’s offer of $2,400 to settle a total 
balance due of $100,437. (Tr. 32-35; GE 10 at 15-16) Applicant appealed the IRS’ 
denial of his compromise offer. (Tr. 34-37) In June 2010, a federal tax lien was filed 
against him for $74,000. (Tr. 26-28) He provided 16 money orders payable to the U.S. 
Treasury as follows: September 18, 2009 ($100); September 18, 2009 ($150); 
November 20, 2009 ($120); December 18, 2009 ($120); February 19, 2010 ($120); 
March 19, 2010 ($120); March 19, 2010; April 30, 2010 ($120); May 28, 2010 ($120); 
June 18, 2010 ($120); July 16, 2010 ($120); August 27, 2010 ($120); September 20, 
2010 ($120); October 19, 2010 ($120); November 20, 2010 ($120); and January 1, 
2011 ($120) (GE 10 at 17-20; pg. 28, 29, 30, 33).2 He is consistently paying the IRS 
$120 per month, and he believes this is satisfactory to the IRS. (Tr. 37-39) He paid his 
2009 federal tax debt in July 2010. (pg. 18, 31, 32) However, he is paying less than two 
percent of the amount he owes to the IRS, and his payment is insufficient to reduce the 
principal owes. He is only paying part of the statutory interest on his debt.3 
   
SOR ¶¶ 1.b 2010 state tax lien for $2,685; 1.c 2008 state tax lien for $2,679; 
1.d 2007 state tax lien for $35,057; and 1.i 2005 state tax lien for $1,727—
Inadequate Payment Plan. In 2006, Applicant filed his state tax returns for 2000 to 
2006. (Tr. 42) On October 9, 2008, Applicant’s state tax authority wrote that his tax 
liability for 2000 to 2005 and 2007 totals $43,210. (Tr. 40-41; GE 10 at 22) For 2006, he 
owes about $2,600. (Tr. 41; GE 6) Applicant believes the true amount he owes is about 
$38,000 because that is the amount of the lien that the state filed. (Tr. 40) He did not 
owe the state anything for tax years 2008 and 2009, and he had refunds that were due. 
(Tr. 41-42) The refunds for those years were applied to reduce his tax delinquency. (Tr. 
45) In November 2008, he started making $100 monthly payments. (Tr. 44; pg. 15) He 
provided 21 money orders for $100 each dated from November 21, 2008, to November 
20, 2010. (pg. 19-25; GE 10 at 23-28) The state accepted Applicant’s payments; 
however, he did not receive any correspondence indicating whether or not his payment 
plan was acceptable. (Tr. 45) However, he is paying less than four percent of the 
amount he owes to the state tax authority, and his payment is insufficient to reduce the 
principal owes. He is only paying part of the statutory interest on his debt.4 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e telephone debt for $350—Paid. On December 29, 2010, the creditor 
wrote and offered to settle the $350 debt for $263. On February 18, 2011, Applicant 
paid this debt using a money order. (Tr. 46-47; pg. 49-50)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f judgment for credit card for $7,001 and 1.j collection account for 
bank debt in 1.f for $5,109—Unresolved. The debt in 1.j was included in the judgment

interrogatories are not legible. (GE 10)  
 
3 The IRS charged four percent interest throughout 2010, three percent from January 1, 2011 to 
March 31, 2011, and will charge four percent from April 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011. Rev. Rul. 2011-5 at 11,

entered in June 2002 for $7,001. (Tr. 48, 52; GE 3, 8) On May 14, 2008, the creditor 
wrote Applicant seeking $5,109. (Tr. 49; pg. 10-11) On June 1, 2008, Applicant wrote 
the creditor that his name was incorrect in the correspondence from the collection 
company. He said he believed it was a sign that the debt was not established because 
the creditor did not garnish his wages. (Tr. 49-50; pg. 11) Applicant did not contact the 
original creditor about the debt. (Tr. 51) The debt was on his March 2009 credit report 
and did not appear on his February 24, 2011 credit report. (Tr. 52) Applicant indicated 
the debt fell off the credit report, and he had not done anything to resolve it. (Tr. 52)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.g garnishment for bank debt for $2,349—Paid. In 2002, this debt 
became delinquent. (GE 11 at 4) On December 28, 2010, he satisfied the judgment. (Tr. 
53; pg. 9)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.h collection debt for $1,502—Disputed. Applicant disputed this debt, 
and on June 5, 2008, it was removed from his Equifax credit report. (Tr. 53-54; GE 4 at 
9, 11; pg. 34)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.k telecommunications debt for $605—Unresolved. On March 1, 
2011, Applicant wrote the creditor and asked the creditor to establish the authenticity of 
the debt. He has not received a response from the creditor. (Tr. 55; pg. 35) He promised 
to pay the debt, if the creditor could validate his responsibility for it. (Tr. 55)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.l automobile collection debt for $7,151—Disputed. In 2002, 
Applicant’s BMW was repossessed; however, the vehicle was damaged. (Tr. 55-56) He 
owed $4,180 on the debt. (Tr. 57; pg. 40; GE 4, 9) A law firm took over the collection of 
the debt, and Applicant asked the law firm for proof of the sale at auction. (Tr. 56) On 
February 1, 2011, the law firm ceased collection efforts; however, the law firm indicated 
another collection company may contact Applicant. (Tr. 56-58; pg. 39, 40)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.m collection debt for $510 and 1.n collection debt for $350 
resulted from payday loans—Unresolved. Applicant admitted borrowing the money, 
which resulted in these two debts. He plans to pay these two debts next. (Tr. 58-59) On 
February 23, 2011, he wrote the creditor that he was willing to pay the debts, if the 
collection company was still collecting them. (pg. 46) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.o telecommunications collection debt for $99—Paid. On June 26, 
2009, Applicant paid the debt with a money order. (Tr. 59-60; pg. 53) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.p 1.q two medical collection debts for $50 each—Paid. On April 
2010, Applicant paid the creditor. (Tr. 60-61; pg. 54-57) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.r collection debt for $783—Paid. Around 2001 to 2003, the debt 
became delinquent. (Tr. 62) On February 11, 2011, Applicant paid $195 to the creditor 
and resolved the debt. (Tr. 61-62; pg. 44)     
  
Applicant’s personal financial statement (PFS) shows net monthly income of 
$4,344, monthly expenses of $3,141, monthly debt payments of $1,053, and a monthly 
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
remainder of $150. (Tr. 62-66; GE 10 at 12) His remainder is now increased by $75 
because he has paid off one of his debts. (Tr. 62-66; GE 10 at 12) However, his child 
support is indicated on his PFS to be $500, and a court order shows it may be $981 per 
month. (pg. 41; GE 10 at 12) 
 
According to an August 11, 2005 court order, Applicant’s child support for his son 
was $639 per month, and an arrearage of $1,078 was assessed. (pg. 42, 43) According 
to a March 14, 2008 court order, Applicant’s child monthly support for his son was $981, 
and an arrearage of $827 was assessed. (pg. 41) He said his child support and car 
payments are current. (Tr. 64-65; pg. 41-43)  
 
Applicant satisfied a 2002 non-SOR judgment owed to a department store on 
June 17, 2010. (pg. 8, 28) The $9,412 non-SOR debt was paid through a garnishment. 
(GE 11 at 28) He paid a non-SOR collection debt in April 2008. (pg. 47, 48) On April 29, 
2009, he settled a non-SOR telecommunications debt for $353 by paying $124. (pg. 51-
52)  
      
 In sum, Applicant’s tax debts resulted from his failure to timely file his taxes, and 
not withholding sufficient funds to pay his taxes when due. He currently owes about 
$140,000 to state and federal tax authorities. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1d, 1.i) His payments to the 
tax authorities are insufficient to fully address the statutory interest on the principal of 
his tax debts. He provided insufficient evidence to show a dispute or payment plan for 
four debts. (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.n) He paid six debts. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g, 1.o, 1.p, 
1.q, and 1.r) He disputed two debts. (SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.l) One debt was a duplication of 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. (SOR ¶ 1.j) 
     
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
  AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy 
debts”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(g) failure to file annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required . . . .” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 
at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(Internal citation omitted.) Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, and his statement at his hearing. Applicant’s SOR lists 18 
delinquent debts totaling $168,493. In August 2006, Applicant filed his federal and state 
income tax returns for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. He owes the IRS about 
$100,000 and the state tax authority about $40,000. The Government established the 
disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g), requiring additional inquiry 
about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
9 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                           
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant has a good understanding 
of how to resolve his debts. However, he did not establish “there are clear indications 
that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” He acted in good faith with 
respect to the six SOR debts that he paid: 1.e ($350); 1.g ($2,349 through garnishment 
of part of his salary);5 1.o ($99); 1.p ($50); 1.q ($50); and 1.r ($783). He also paid 
several other non-SOR debts, and his child support and car payments are current. 
However, he did not establish that he acted in good faith6 in regard to his state and 
federal tax debts, which are approximately $140,000 and several other unresolved 
debts. He is making monthly payments of $100 to the state and $120 to the IRS. 
Applicant has not established that he is paying the interest on the tax debts as his 
annual payment of $2,640 is less than two perent of $140,000. Applicant had some 
periods of unemployment until he received his current employment in 2005, and 
underemployment when he lost his second job. Unemployment and underemployment 
are conditions largely beyond his control; however, he did not prove that he acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. His failure to file his tax returns and to withhold 
sufficient funds from his monthly paychecks to pay his taxes was irresponsible, and it 
caused most of his delinquent debt. He failed to take action to resolve several other 
SOR debts.  
 
Applicant did not make sufficient effort to maintain contact with the IRS and state 
tax authorities from 2000 to 2006, and he has not adequately addressed several large 
debts.7 As to the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($7,001), 1.k ($605), 1.m ($510), and 1.n ($350), 
there is insufficient evidence to establish Applicant is engaged in an ongoing effort to 
maintain contact with these creditors and resolve these four debts. Applicant is credited 
under AG ¶ 20(e) with disputing the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($1,502) and 1.l ($7,151). 
 
5See ISCR Case No. 08-06059 at 6 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2009) (indicating involuntary payment of 
debts through garnishment is not necessarily mitigating). 
   
6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].  
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  
 
7“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current. 
 
10 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Although it is possible the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l will resurface with a different collection 
agent, at this time the debtor holding the debt is unknown.   
 
Applicant has not provided enough evidence to establish that his delinquent debt 
is unlikely to recur. His track record of financial responsibility shows insufficient effort, 
good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability to warrant mitigation of financial 
considerations concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of 
a defense contractor. He completed 62 college credits towards a bachelor’s degree, 
majoring in information systems management. He served in the Air Force from 1977 to 
1999 and honorably retired as a master sergeant. He is not married. He is making 
monthly $500 child support payments for his seven-year-old son, and his child support 
is current.  
  
Applicant held two full time jobs from 1997 until 2002. From 2002 to 2005, he 
was laid off from one job or the other or both. He was unemployed from June 2004 to 
January 2005. From August 2005 to the present, he has been employed by the same 
major defense contractor in computer repair, and from about December 2006 to 
January 2008, he had a full-time job as a security guard. His unemployment and 
underemployment from 2002 to present adversely affected his financial circumstances.  
  
 
11 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Applicant is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security 
responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. 
Government as an employee of a contractor and during his years of active duty Air 
Force service. There is every indication that he is loyal to the United States and his 
employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. These 
factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. 
 
 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial. His SOR lists 18 delinquent debts totaling $168,493. In August 2006, 
he filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 
2005. He did not provide a credible explanation for his failure to timely file tax returns 
and his under withholding of his tax payments from 2000 to 2005. He owes the IRS 
about $100,000 and state tax authorities about $40,000. He is paying the tax authorities 
$220 per month, which is unlikely to fully address interest requirements on these two 
large tax debts. He cannot be fully credited with paying the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g ($2,349) 
because it was paid through garnishment. He paid five other SOR debts; however, the 
total resolved is only $1,332. He paid some non-SOR debts; however, he failed to make 
sufficient progress resolving his SOR debts. Financial considerations security concerns 
are not fully mitigated at this time.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:   Against Applicant  
Subparagraph 1.j:   For Applicant (withdrawn-duplication) 
Subparagraph 1.k:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:   For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.m and 1.n: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.o to 1.r: For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
