GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 26, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the 
interrogatories on January 25, 2010.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA issued her 
another set of interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on January 25, 
2010.3 On April 29, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated August 26, 2008. 
 
2 Government Exhibit 5 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated January 25, 2010).

pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 4, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on May 25, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on July 1, 2010, and the case was assigned to 
Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher on July 2, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was 
issued on July 27, 2010, and he convened the hearing, as scheduled, on August 19, 
2010. At the hearing, Applicant requested a continuance because the attorney she had 
hired and paid had filed for his own bankruptcy and had declined to appear on her 
behalf. A continuance was granted. The case was reassigned to Administrative Judge 
Sharon Dam on August 24, 2010. Another continuance was requested by Applicant on 
September 8, 2010, and it was granted on September 16, 2010. The case was 
reassigned to me on October 4, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 13, 
2010, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 2, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, ten Government exhibits (GE 1-10) and ten Applicant exhibits 
(AE A-J) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant and one other witness 
testified on her behalf. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 7, 2010. 
The record was kept open until December 23, 2010, to enable Applicant to supplement 
the record. Applicant took advantage of that opportunity and she submitted one 
additional document which was admitted into evidence (AE K) without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.a. through 1.aa.) of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and 
upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
an administrative assistant.4 She is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of 
which has not been divulged. She is a 1983 high school graduate and a 2001 college 
graduate with a degree in an unspecified discipline.5 Over the years, Applicant has held 
4 Government Exhibit 1, supra note 1, at 10-11.

several different positions with various employers. She was a preschool teacher from 
October 1999 until June 2007, and an administrative assistant from June 2007 until 
April 2008. She joined her current employer in May 2008.6 Applicant has never served 
with the U.S. military.7 
 
Applicant was married in August 1986,8 and she and her husband have three 
daughters, born in 1988, 1991, and 1998, respectively.9 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about October 2006 
when her eldest daughter became ill and was hospitalized for three or four months, 
commencing in September 2006.10 Applicant took a leave of absence from work during 
the entire time to care for her then 18-year-old daughter, and she was at the hospital 
almost full-time.11 Before October 2006, Applicant’s credit was excellent.12 However, 
once she took her leave of absence, Applicant’s husband’s income was insufficient for 
them to keep up with their monthly bills.13 When Applicant returned to work, she took on 
reduced hours, with a reduced salary, to care for her daughter at home.14 Some 
accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. In 
January 2007, one of Applicant’s daughters was involved in an automobile accident, 
and she spent four days in the hospital.15 Applicant took on the responsibility of paying 
her daughter’s $58 monthly student loan payments until her daughter was able to regain 
her driver’s license.16 
 
In about July 2007, Applicant contacted a debt resolution company via the 
Internet and eventually, after consulting with a representative on the telephone, she 
signed a contract with the debt resolution company to assist her with debt consolidation

and debt resolution.17 The agreement called for Applicant to deposit $107 in her 
checking account each month for the debt resolution company to contact Applicant’s 
creditors, as well as another $107 in her savings account to build up funds sufficient to 
enable her to negotiate with her creditors.18 Applicant was unable to keep setting aside 
those funds, and was disappointed that there were no positive results derived from the 
debt resolution company. Accordingly, in May 2008, after about ten months under the 
contract, Applicant cancelled it.19 
 
Throughout 2008, Applicant worked overtime in an effort to “get ahead 
financially.”20 It was her intention to attempt to save enough money to pay off her small 
debts first and then to try to negotiate with her creditors for her larger debts and set up 
repayment plans.21 Applicant contacted her creditors with the intention of some type of 
repayment plan, but her efforts and intentions were overcome by events.22 Based on 
her salary in 2008, Applicant estimated it would take her at least two years to catch up 
on her delinquent debts.23 In March 2009, when the construction industry collapsed, 
Applicant’s husband’s construction company essentially shut down, and he remained 
unemployed until January 2010, when he returned to work with a reduced income.24 
 
On October 6, 2009, Applicant and her husband engaged the services of a 
bankruptcy attorney to provide them with legal counsel and representation in the filing of 
a joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as well as 
a pre-bankruptcy review, credit counseling, and a financial management course.25 The 
entire legal fee for such services was $2,590, plus $299 filing fee, of which $1,000 was 
non-refundable.26 Applicant paid the attorney $2,850 plus another $300 for the filing 
fee.27 Included in her payment was $600 in cash as a retainer.28 On October 11, 2009, 
a certified financial counselor sent Applicant her bankruptcy briefing packet and

In late October 2009, Applicant sought home mortgage loan modification 
guidance from the local urban league.30 On the advice of her bankruptcy attorney, 
Applicant delayed filing for bankruptcy until the loan modification could be completed.31 
It took several months for the loan modification process, but in July 2010, Applicant’s 
final home mortgage loan modification agreement was approved.32 
 
In June 2010, Applicant’s bankruptcy attorney informed Applicant:33 
 
In light of the many economic challenges afflicting our firm, after much 
consideration, we have decided to wind down our future operations. Rest 
assured that this transition will be seamless because our commitment to 
you and your case will not change. During the transition period, we will not 
be accepting any new cases. Instead, we have chosen to devote all of our 
time and energy to the completion of our existing cases. 
 
In fact, although the bankruptcy attorney had already been paid in full, he 
performed no further professional services on Applicant’s behalf, and failed to answer or 
return telephone calls or release Applicant’s documents.34 Instead, Applicant was 
approached by an out-of-state law firm that claimed it had been retained to possibly 
represent Applicant and would get back to her once the issue of the retainer had been 
resolved.35 Attached to the letter was a form to be completed by Applicant authorizing 
an ACH/Direct Debit Program to enable the new law firm to withdraw funds from 
Applicant’s bank account.36 During the interim, and following her first attorney’s advice, 
and presuming her delinquent accounts were in her bankruptcy, Applicant made no 
payments on those accounts.37 The new law firm never said it would represent 
Applicant, and she was leery about giving it any money.38 Finally, after months of

waiting for a decision, the new law firm declined to handle Applicant’s bankruptcy.39 
Applicant subsequently filed her complaint against the bankruptcy attorney with the 
state bar.40 
 
In the beginning, Applicant intended to file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to pay her creditors.41 Things did not work out as 
she had intended. On December 20, 2010, Applicant signed an agreement with another 
local bankruptcy law firm to provide Applicant and her husband with legal counsel and 
representation in the filing of a joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code.42 The entire legal fee for such services was $3,148, including $299 
filing fee.43 Applicant paid the attorney a $500 retainer, and is to make six monthly 
payments of $441.33, commencing on January 20, 2011.44  
 
On an unspecified date in early January 2010, Applicant completed a Personal 
Financial Statement reflecting a net combined monthly income of $6,234.36; monthly 
expenses of $4,679; and debt repayments of $855.45 She estimated she had a monthly 
remainder of $700.36 available for discretionary spending.46 Applicant contends she is 
current on all other accounts and has not incurred any new debts since 2008.47 
 
The SOR identified 27 purportedly continuing delinquencies, as reflected by 
credit reports from 2008,48 2009,49 and 2010,50 totaling approximately $55,121, in 
collection or charged-off accounts. Some accounts reflected in the credit reports have 
been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other 
accounts are referenced repeatedly, in many instances duplicating other accounts 
listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor name. Some 
accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are identified by

Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Applicant’s annual performance reviews for the periods of April 2008 through 
March 2009, and April 2009 through March 2010, reflect an employee whose overall 
performance rating is “high meets,” the second highest rating of the five possibilities.51 
She received merit awards in 2009 and 2010,52 as well as a promotion in 2010, with an 
associated salary increase of 10.04 percent.53 A 2005 performance appraisal from a 
former employer rates Applicant as “very good – performance is clearly above normal 
job standards; consistently one of the better performers,” the second highest rating of 
five possibilities.54  
 
Applicant’s supervisor (who also happens to be her sister-in-law) and coworkers 
are very supportive of Applicant’s application for a security clearance. Applicant is 
considered organized, extremely competent, committed, motivated, a hard worker, 
friendly, reliable, efficient, cooperative, and in possession of a “strong moral 
compass.”55 Applicant’s reputation for honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness is 
considered “great.”56 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”57 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”58

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”59 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.60  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”61 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”62 Thus, nothing 
59 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until about October 2006. Commencing in September 2006, Applicant took a 
leave of absence from work to care for her then 18-year-old daughter who was 
hospitalized. However, Applicant’s husband’s income was insufficient for them to keep 
up with their monthly bills, and when Applicant returned to work, she took on reduced 
hours, with a reduced salary, to care for her daughter at home. Some accounts became 
delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. All of the accounts have 
remained unresolved. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
 
10 
                                      
 
                                                          
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@63  
 
Applicant’s financial difficulties resulted from a combination of events which 
initially commenced in September 2006 when her eldest daughter became ill and was 
hospitalized for three or four months. Applicant took a leave of absence from work 
during the entire time to care for her daughter, but Applicant’s husband’s income was 
insufficient for them to keep up with their monthly bills. When Applicant returned to 
work, she took on reduced hours, with a reduced salary, to care for her daughter at 
home. Accounts became delinquent and were either placed for collection or charged off. 
Another incident occurred in January 2007, when one of Applicant’s daughters was 
involved in an automobile accident, and she spent four days in the hospital. Applicant 
took on the temporary responsibility of paying her daughter’s monthly student loan 
payments.  
 
In about July 2007, Applicant signed a contract with the debt resolution company 
to assist her with debt consolidation and debt resolution. Over a period of about ten 
months, during which Applicant made payments to the debt resolution company, she 
became disillusioned that there were no positive results derived from the debt resolution 
company. In May 2008, she cancelled the contract.  
 
Throughout 2008, Applicant worked overtime in an effort to “get ahead 
financially.” It was her intention to attempt to save enough money to pay off her small 
debts first and then to try to negotiate with her creditors for her larger debts and set up 
repayment plans. Applicant contacted her creditors with the intention of some type of 
repayment plan, but her efforts and intentions were overcome by events. In March 
2009, with the collapse of the construction industry, Applicant’s husband’s construction 
company shut down, and he remained unemployed until January 2010, when he 
returned to work with a reduced income. 
 
In October 2009, in another effort to resolve her delinquent accounts, Applicant 
and her husband hired a bankruptcy attorney to provide them with legal counsel and 
representation in the filing of a joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. Applicant paid the attorney $3,150. Later that month, a certified 
financial counselor sent Applicant her a bankruptcy briefing packet and financial 
63 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

counseling materials, including a financial assessment with current and proposed 
budget, a customized action plan, a briefing certificate, and a reference detailing 
Applicant’s various options. Following her bankruptcy attorney’s advice, and presuming 
her delinquent accounts were in her bankruptcy, Applicant made no payments on those 
accounts. If everything had occurred as initially planned, Applicant’s delinquent 
accounts would have been resolved by mid-2010. Unfortunately, in June 2010, the 
bankruptcy attorney went bankrupt, causing Applicant to lose the money she paid him 
as well as precious time with respect to the bankruptcy filing.  
 
An out-of-state law firm was to take over Applicant’s bankruptcy representation, 
but after months of waiting for a decision, the new law firm declined to handle 
Applicant’s bankruptcy. In July 2010, Applicant’s home mortgage loan modification 
agreement was approved. In December 2010, Applicant engaged another local 
bankruptcy law firm to file a joint petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. Applicant paid the attorney a $500 retainer, and is to make six 
monthly payments of $441.33, commencing on January 20, 2011. Applicant is current 
on all other accounts and has not incurred any new debts since 2008. 
 
Much of what occurred was largely beyond Applicant’s control and took place 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Applicant received counseling for 
her financial problems, and there are clear indications that the problem would have 
been resolved in mid-2010, but is now being resolved. Applicant acted responsibly 
under the circumstances, and her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, 
are not in question. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c), apply, and 20(d), partially applies. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has a 
history of financial delinquencies commencing in 2006, when she permitted accounts to 
 
12 
                                      
 
                                                          
become delinquent and placed for collection or charged off. Those accounts remained 
delinquent for over four years. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s initial financial delinquencies were the unfortunate consequence of her 
daughter’s illness and Applicant’s efforts to care for her. Her financial difficulties 
continued because of her time off from work and eventual reduced salary, as well as her 
husband’s lengthy period of unemployment due to the collapse of the construction 
industry. Throughout 2008, Applicant worked overtime in an effort to get ahead 
financially to be able to address her delinquent accounts. Applicant is current on all 
other accounts and has not incurred any new debts since 2008. She obtained financial 
guidance and counseling, and engaged attorneys to assist her in resolving her 
delinquent accounts. She obtained a modification of her home loan mortgage.  
 
Applicant did not turn her back on her creditors. Instead, she followed legal 
advice and went the route of bankruptcy. Unfortunately, her efforts were delayed when 
one bankruptcy attorney declared bankruptcy, another declined to represent her, and 
she was forced to pay another bankruptcy attorney to represent her. I have evaluated 
the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have 
not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.64 Her substantial efforts are sufficient to 
mitigate continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:65 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
64 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations.

clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
