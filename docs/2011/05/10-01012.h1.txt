HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant owes more than $40,000 in delinquent federal tax. He has failed to 
rebut or mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Defense Department’s (DoD) intent to deny or revoke his 
eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order 
and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) on August 2, 2010, detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F, financial considerations. 
  
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006. 
 
 
1 
 On September 17, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. 
On November 15, 2010, I was assigned the case. On January 26, 2011, DOHA issued a 
Notice of Hearing for the hearing held on Febuary 10, 2011.  
 
 The Government offered exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 6, which were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted exhibits A through F, which 
were admitted into evidence without objection. The record was held open to allow 
additional information from Applicant. On March 3, 2011, additional material was 
submitted. Department Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted 
into the record as Ex. G. On February 18, 2011, DOHA received the hearing transcript 
(Tr.). 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In Applicant’s SOR Answer, he denied a $56 debt (SOR 1.b) and admitted the 
remaining debts, with explanations. I incorporate Applicant’s admissions to the SOR 
allegations. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant is a 46-year-old test director who has worked for a defense contractor 
since May 2006. (Tr. 34) He is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance. (Tr. 28, 
Ex. 1) Applicant’s duty performance resulted in four awards for outstanding 
achievement dated: December 2006, October 2008, December 2008, and September 
2010. (Ex. G) He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering and. 
has not been unemployed since at least 2001. (Tr. 32, 84)  
 
In February 1994, Applicant married and in late 2005, divorced.2 (Tr. 30) His ex-
wife’s inability to make the monthly mortgage payments resulted in the foreclosure on 
their home. Applicant had no additional obligation on the house following the 
foreclosure. 
  
In 2000 and 2001, Applicant was living in the Midwest and commuting to the west 
coast for work. He failed to file his taxes for a number of years. (Ex. 2) He asserted he 
filed the missing tax returns in 2007. However, his 2000 and 2001, nonresident or part-
year resident state tax forms were filed in May 2010. (Ex. 2, Tr. 79) In 2004, he moved 
to his current state, which has no state income tax.  
 
Applicant’s October 2009 credit bureau report (CBR) lists five tax liens for: 
$4,441; $1,896; $2,239; $2,964; and $25,560. (Ex. 4) The $1,896 lien, filed in 
November 2004, was paid in March 2005 and released. (Ex. 4, Ex. 4) In July 2004, a 
state tax lien was issued against Applicant for $2,239, which was released in December 
2010. (Ex. E) In November 2005, his former state recorded a $4,441 state tax lien 
                                                          
2 On his October 2009, Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) he indicated in 
response to question 17.b that the divorce occurred in May 2004. (Ex. 1) His tax preparer indicates that 
divorce occurred in 2006. (Ex. F) His 2005 federal tax return lists him as married and his 2006 federal tax 
return lists him as single. (Ex. G)  
 
2 
against him. (Ex. 4) Until 2009, he continued making monthly tax payments to satisfy 
the tax lien for the state he had left in 2004. (Tr. 112) In June 2009, the state tax lien 
was released. (Ex. D) In October 2008, federal tax liens were issued against Applicant 
for $2,964 and $25, 560. (Ex. 2, Ex. 4) 
 
In 2004, Applicant started working with a tax preparer. (Ex. F, Tr. 47) He asserts 
he calls his preparer 40 or 50 times a year. (Tr. 84) His tax preparer provided three 
statements (Ex. 2, Ex. F, and Ex. G) which were inconsistent with each other 
concerning when Applicant’s tax returns were filed and the amount of the resulting 
taxes. On May 10, 2010, Applicant’s tax preparer provided a letter concerning tax 
preparation dates and taxes owed. This affidavit was not accompanied by copies of any 
tax returns, but was accompanied by Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account 
transcripts for tax years 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007. The affidavit indicated:

2008 August 10, 2009 0

On February 7, 2011, Applicant’s tax preparer provided a sworn affidavit 
concerning the filing dates and taxes owed. Again, no copies of state or federal tax 
returns accompanied that affidavit. The filing dates remain constant, but the amounts of 
taxes owed differ from the earlier letter. A summary of that letter and the taxes owed 
follows:

 In March 2011, following the hearing, Applicant’s tax preparer provided copies of 
the Applicant’s tax returns. Except for tax years 2005 and 2007, the filing dates differ 
from material presented in the earlier letters. A summary of that letter and the taxes 
owed follows:

On March 25, 2004, Applicant completed a Security Clearance Application, 
Standard Form (SF) 86. (Ex. 6) He answered “no” to question 38, which asked if he had 
been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt during the prior seven years. He also 
answered “no” to question 39, which asked if he was currently more than 90 days 
 
4 
delinquent on any debt. At that time he completed his SF 86, he had not filed and was 
delinquent, on his 2001 and 2002 federal income taxes and his 2002 state tax.  
 
On October 13, 2009, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (Ex. 1) He answered “no” to question 26.m, which 
asked if he had been more than 180 days delinquent on any debt during the prior seven 
years. He also answered “no” to question 26.n, which asked if he was currently more 
than 90 days delinquent on any debt. At that time he completed his 2009 e-QIP, he had 
not filed, and was delinquent on his 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2007 federal 
income taxes and his 2001 state tax. 
 
In January 2009, Applicant entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to 
repay $45,000 in taxes. He agreed to make $500 monthly payments starting in February 
2009. (SOR Answer). In September 2010, he entered into an installment agreement 
with the IRS to repay $44,000 in taxes whereby he would make $250 monthly 
payments. During 2009 and 2010, he made no payments on the installment 
agreements. (Tr. 74) 
 
In November 2009, Applicant was asked about his unpaid tax liabilities and 
additional delinquent accounts that were in collection or had been charged off. (Ex. 2) At 
that time, he provided a sworn statement concerning his finances, which he reviewed in 
April 2010. (Ex. 2)  
 
When asked at hearing what type of vehicle he drove, he responded by 
acknowledging a 1995 Chevrolet pickup, which was paid for. (Tr. 60) On questioning by 
department counsel, Applicant admitted purchasing a $32,000 Chrysler in 2007 with 
monthly payments of $600. (Tr. 79) As of December 2010, the balance owed on the 
vehicle was $22,973 and the loan was being paid as agreed. (Ex. 4) As of October 
2009, Applicant owed $70,335 in student loans, which he is paying as agreed. 
 
As of June 2010, Applicant’s monthly gross income was $4,800, his monthly 
expenses were $3,800, and he was making $318 monthly payments on $60,000 in 
student loans, which left a net monthly remainder of $679. (Ex. 2) At the hearing, he 
stated his monthly take-home pay had increased to $6,000. (Tr. 64) His current annual 
salary is approximately $105,000. As of February 2011, he had $31,118 in his 
retirement plan. (Ex. G) His wife does not work because she suffers from fibromyalgia. 
(Tr. 65)  
 
His January 2011 credit bureau report (CBR) lists four collection accounts: $634 
utility bill (SOR 1 e), $197 insurance debt, $153 utility bill (SOR 1.c), and $56 gym 
membership fee (SOR 1.b). (Ex. C) Of the four SOR collection accounts, Applicant’s 
CBR indicates he disputed the $153 (SOR 1.c) electric utility account. (Ex. C) In 
November 2009, Applicant was asked about five delinquent accounts. At the hearing, 
he was again asked about these debts and he was still uncertain about the $153 energy 
account (SOR 1. c), the $128 collection account (SOR 1.d), and the $634 energy 
collection account (SOR 1.e). The amounts owed on the two utility bills ($634 and $694) 
 
5 
are similar. However, Applicant stated he believed the energy accounts were from 
different states. (Tr. 89) 
 
The end of February 2011, Applicant anticipated receiving $74,338 from the sale 
of his house. (Ex. B) Following closing costs, commissions, and other fees, he expected 
to receive around $60,000. (Tr. 52) The outstanding liability on the house is $45,000, 
which would provide him $15,000 from the sale of the house. (Tr. 52) No documentation 
was received establishing the house went to closing in February 2011, as anticipated or 
the amount realized from the sale. Applicant asserted he hoped to have all of his debt 
paid by March 2011. (Tr. 85) No documentation was presented establishing he has paid 
his past due taxes or other delinquent accounts.  
 
Applicant paid a counseling service $200 to help him clean up his credit report. 
The counseling service told Applicant to pay as much of his debt as he could and work 
out payment arrangements on the other accounts. (Tr. 1010) In 2009, his credit score 
was around 540. (Tr. 114) As of January 2011, his credit scores were 684, 718, and 
734. (Ex. C)

collection and other unpaid obligations and their current status follows:

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
 
7 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be 
irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and 
safeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect 
of life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems. Applicant has delinquent, unpaid 
tax liability for tax years 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007 exceeding $40,000. In September 
2010, when he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS, he indicted he owed 
approximately $44,000. He has four collection accounts, which together total less than 
$1,000. Disqualifying Conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” 
and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
 
8 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant has been not been unemployed since at least 2001 and has worked for 
his current employer since 2006. His annual salary is $105,000. In November 2009, he 
was questioned about his delinquent accounts and his finances and in April 2010, 
answered interrogatories about his finances. Although first asked about four minor 
collection accounts in November 2009, he has paid only one SOR debt (SOR 1.d, 
$694). He has not addressed his delinquent taxes even though he entered into 
installment agreements with the IRS to make payments starting in 2009 and 2010. Even 
the four collection accounts that range between $56 and $634 remain unpaid.  
 
Applicant’s financial problems have continued for several years. He should have 
been more diligent and made greater efforts to resolve these debts. Although first 
questioned in 2009, he was still unsure of the nature of three of his delinquent debts in 
February 2011. The record fails to support he has aggressively pursued paying these 
debts or his delinquent taxes. 
 
Applicant started working with his tax preparer in 2004 and stated he talks with 
his preparer 40 to 50 times a year. Although Applicant was talking with his preparer 
since 2004, the bulk of his returns were not filed until after the hearing. Additionally, he 
made no payments on his delinquent taxes during 2009 or 2010 pursuant to his 
installment agreements. His tax preparer gave conflicting accounts of when Applicant’s 
states and federal tax returns were actually filed. He also gave inconsistent amounts of 
Applicant’s delinquent tax liability. In May 2010, the preparer indicated Applicant owed 
more than $19,000 for tax year 2001 and in February 2011 the amount was less than 
$9,000. He gave no explanation for the difference.  
 
9 
 
For the four tax years in question, 2001, 2004, 2006, and 2007, three of the tax 
returns were filed after the hearing. For tax years 2000 through 2009, tax returns for 
seven of the years in question were filed in February 2011, after the hearing. It appears 
the tax returns for tax years 2005, 2007, 2008, and 2010 were the only returns filed 
timely.  
 
Applicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. 
Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous, ongoing, and remain unpaid. His continuing 
delinquent debts constitute a “continuing course of conduct.” ISCR Case No. 087-11814 
at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 
2002)).  
 
Applicant failed to provide proof that he has made adequate efforts to set up 
payment plans, or provide proof he has taken timely efforts to resolve his delinquent 
debts. He set up repayment agreements with the IRS in 2009 to make $500 monthly 
payments and then in 2010 he agreed to make $250 monthly payments. Although he 
made the agreements, he failed to make any payments in accord with these 
arrangements. He was unable to honor either installment agreement, but was able to 
make his $600 monthly car payments. He has not acted responsibly in addressing his 
debts. I find AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 The mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. His financial 
problems do not appear to be caused by factors beyond his control such as loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation. He has been employed continuously since 2001 and with his current 
employer since May 2006. The record contains various dates between May 2004 and 
2006 of when his divorce occurred. In any event, it has been more than four years since 
the divorce. Applicant failed to show his inability to repay his delinquent taxes or the four 
minor accounts resulted from his divorce.  
 
 Applicant has received counseling and his credit score has improved from 540 to 
the high 600s to mid-700s. For the mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(c) to apply 
there must be clear indications that Applicant’s financial problems are being resolved or 
are under control. He hoped to be debt free by March 2011. However, he provided no 
documentation supporting his hope. His house was to sell in February 2011, but he 
provided no evidence the sale occurred, how much he received from the sale, or how 
the proceeds were spent. He provided no documentation showing he has paid his 
delinquent taxes or other accounts. The mitigating condition in AG ¶ 20(c) does not 
apply. 
 
 As previously stated, Applicant wants to pay his debt, but failed to provide 
evidence of a good-faith effort to satisfy his debts. Good-faith requires a showing that a 
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to 
duty or obligation. To date, Applicant has shown little effort to address his delinquent 
 
10 
accounts. He has satisfied one $694 charged-off account creditor. AG ¶ 20(d) applies 
only to the account he paid.  
 
The mitigating condition listed in AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. Applicant denied the 
$56 gym membership fee. He admitted the majority of his delinquent debt. For AG ¶ 
20(e) to apply Applicant must not only deny the debt, also but must provide documented 
proof to substantiate any reasonable basis of the dispute. He provided no such 
documentation.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has received four 
outstanding achievement awards in December 2006, October 2008, December 2008, 
and September 2010. Evidence of good character is relevant and material under the 
whole-person concept. However, an applicant=s technical expertise (or lack thereof) is 
not a measure of whether the applicant demonstrates the high degree of judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness that must be possessed by persons entrusted with 
classified information.  
 
In deciding whether to grant or continue access to classified information, the 
Government must consider whether an applicant=s conduct and circumstances pose a 
risk of deliberate or inadvertent disclosure of classified information. An applicant=s 
technical expertise and contributions to defense programs do not make the applicant 
less likely to deliberately or inadvertently disclose classified information; and an 
applicant=s lack of technical expertise and absence of any contribution to defense 
programs to not make the applicant more likely to deliberately or inadvertently disclose

classified information. See ISCR Case No. 01-19878 at p.3 (App. Bd. October 29, 
2002). ISCR Case No. 02B04237 at p.3 (App. Bd. August 12, 2003). 
 
Applicant’s assertion that he will be debt free in March 2011 is given little credit. 
In 2009, he promised to start making payments to the IRS, but failed to do so. In 2010, 
he again promised to start monthly payments, but again failed to do so. In 2004, when 
asked if he was delinquent on any debts he answered “no” even though he had not filed 
his federal tax returns for 2001 and 2002 and failed to pay his taxes for those years in a 
timely manner. In 2009, he again failed to indicate he was 180 days delinquent on his 
taxes even though the IRS had issued notices of intent to levy due to his delinquent 
2001, 2004, and 2006 federal taxes. Additionally, when asked about motor vehicles he 
owned, he said he was driving a 1995 pickup truck that was paid for. However, he failed 
to mention he was also making $600 monthly payments on a $32,000 vehicle he 
purchased in 2007. Additionally, no documentation of the sale of his home or the 
disposition of any funds received from the sale has been received. For these reasons, I 
find that I can not rely on his assertion his delinquent bills will be paid as soon as he 
claims they will be paid.  
 
The issue is not simply whether all of Applicant’s debts have been paid – they 
have not – it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to 
hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) In 2009, he owed more than $40,000 in 
delinquent tax debt and has made no payment on these delinquent taxes. Since first 
being questioned about in delinquent accounts and taxes in November 2009, Applicant 
was able to pay one charged-off account of less than $700. He has four delinquent 
accounts that total less than $1,000. Even the smallest delinquent debt of $56 remains 
unpaid. His inability to address even these smaller delinquencies raises a concern 
about his fitness to hold a security clearance. He has not acted aggressively in 
addressing his delinquent account and does not know the nature of three of the 
collection accounts.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. This decision should not be 
construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of true 
reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a security clearance. The 
awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on 
applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented.  
 
Applicant asserted, but failed to prove, all of his delinquent debt would be paid by 
March 2011. Under Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. 
Should he be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, 
having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance with a repayment plan, 
or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well demonstrate persuasive evidence 
of his security worthiness. However, at this time, Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns arising from his financial considerations. At this time, a clearance is 
not warranted.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.e:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant     
  
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
