GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding personal conduct. 
She has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug involvement. Eligibility for a 
security clearance and access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 23, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86).1 On July 31, 2007, 
she submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing version of a 
Security Clearance Application (e-QIP).2 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories pertaining to her 
subject interview. She responded to the interrogatories on May 29, 2009.3 On another

unspecified date, DOHA issued her another set of interrogatories pertaining to the 
previous revocation of her security clearance by another government agency. She 
responded to the interrogatories on May 29, 2009.4 On March 15, 2010, DOHA issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  
and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified 
Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR 
alleged security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline H (Drug 
Involvement), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an 
administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, 
denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 19, 2010.5 In a sworn 
statement, dated March 19, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.6 Because 
her answer was incomplete and did not address each allegation, on April 13, 2010, she 
was informed that a more complete response was necessary.7 Applicant acknowledged 
receipt of the letter on April 20, 2010.8 She modified her previous response to answer 
each allegation, and the new response was notarized on April 21, 2010.9 On June 8, 
2010, DOHA amended the SOR to add a subparagraph (¶ 1.e.) under the Guideline E 
allegations; and a new paragraph (¶ 3) alleging concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations).10 Applicant answered the amended SOR on June 21, 2010.11 A 
complete copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to 
Applicant on November 4, 2010, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 
30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on November 10, 2010, and

on December 15, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answers to the original and amended SORs, Applicant admitted all of the 
factual allegations pertaining to personal conduct (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e. of the SOR), as 
well as the factual allegation pertaining to financial considerations (¶ 3.a. of the SOR). 
Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She did not answer the 
factual allegation pertaining to drug involvement (¶ 2.a. of the SOR). 
 
Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving in 
configuration data and document control.12 A June 1964 high school graduate,13 she 
has been employed by the same defense contractor since August 1981.14 She has not 
served in the U.S. military.15 Applicant married her first husband in November 1968, and 
divorced him in February 1973.16 She married her second husband in April 1973, and 
divorced him in April 2006.17 She married her current husband in September 2006.18 
Applicant has one son, who was born in July 1975.19  
 
In June 1996, another Government agency granted her a security clearance with 
access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI).20 In September 2006, Applicant’s 
access was suspended as a result of information regarding her use of marijuana.21 On 
February 5, 2007, her access was revoked, citing security concerns regarding her use 
of marijuana and her failure to acknowledge her drug involvement in her 2005 SF 86.22 
While she was informed that she could request a review of the decision, or file an 
appeal and request a personal appearance,23 it is unclear if she ever exercised her 
rights to either process.

Personal Conduct and Drug Involvement 
 
 Applicant used marijuana on a variety of occasions while holding a security 
clearance with access to SCI granted by another Government agency.24 The period and 
frequency of such use was variously described as unspecified frequency during 1996 to 
at least 2005;25 seven occasions between 1996 and 2006;26 and approximately ten 
times between January 1999 and August 2005.27 She used marijuana in social settings, 
sharing marijuana cigarettes with friends who furnished them, and claimed it “tended to 
calm [her] down as she was stressed due to family problems and her divorce.”28 She 
also noted that at the time she was with an “abusive husband.”29 Applicant offered the 
following explanation in 2007:30  
 
Mother and Father both died in 1999 and [she] was left with a mentally 
retarded brother whom I had to place in a group home and take on a lot of 
responsibilities of the family and was under a lot of pressure and stress. 
 
 On September 23, 2005, when Applicant completed her SF 86, she responded to 
several questions pertaining to the use of illegal drugs or drug activity set forth in the 
application. The Amended SOR alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose 
information when she answered “no” in response to the following questions,31 to wit: § 
24a:  
 
Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you 
illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, 
crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, codeine, heroin, etc.), 
amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, 
etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs? 
 
And § 24b: 
 
Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while employed as a 
law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while

possessing a security clearance; or while in a position directly and 
immediately affecting the public safety? 
 
 Although she had been previously briefed on the organization’s drug policy, she 
failed to comply with both the prohibition of drug use and the requirement that any such 
use be reported.32 During an interview with a security representative on October 12, 
2006, Applicant stated she did not report her drug use because she did not consider it 
to be “habitual” and she thought she might “get into trouble.”33 During her October 2007 
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), 
Applicant contended she neglected to list her drug use “due to oversight.”34 In her 
response to the FORM, on December 1, 2010, Applicant claimed she “just checked the 
box on the form without really thinking of what [she] did.”35 However, in her answer to 
the Amended SOR, she admitted her response was deliberate.36 
 
 Applicant stated she has no intentions of any further marijuana use, and claims 
she no longer knowingly associates with drug users. She has never tested positive in a 
drug screen, and has never been counseled for drug use.37  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until about 2004. In 
September 2004, due to post-surgery complications, she missed a week of work and fell 
behind in her payments of some accounts.38 In September 2005, she reported that she 
had no accounts that were over 90 days delinquent.39 In July 2007, she reported, once 
again, that she had no accounts that were over 90 days delinquent.40 As of October 
2007, she had one account with an outstanding balance of approximately $8,000, of 
which $400 was delinquent, and was current on all other accounts.41 Nevertheless, 
because of what Applicant characterized as an “enormous amount of debt,” and after 
two years of struggling to keep current with her payments,42 on March 28, 2008,

Applicant filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under the provisions of Chapter 7 of 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.43 She cited $223,950 in assets and $132,030 in liabilities.44 
Among her assets was $139,000 in real property.45 Among her liabilities were one $180 
medical bill and ten credit cards.46 Applicant’s liabilities were discharged on July 22, 
2008.47 Applicant eventually attributed her financial problems during that period to the 
results of her divorce.48 
 
There is no evidence indicating Applicant’s finances are anything but current 
after her 2008 bankruptcy discharge. The Amended SOR does not allege continuing 
delinquencies, and there are no credit reports listing any such delinquencies. The 
Amended SOR merely refers to the 2008 bankruptcy. Department Counsel maintains 
that the Government has “lingering doubts as to whether Applicant’s financial situation 
is truly under control.” Nevertheless, in the absence of other supporting evidence, the 
Government moved to withdraw SOR ¶ 3.a.49 Upon due consideration of the motion and 
the evidence, the motion is granted. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”50 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”51   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.

An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”52 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.53  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”54 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”55 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
52 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline H, Drug Involvement 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in 
AG ¶ 24:      
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may 
impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and 
include: 
(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds 
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 
1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, 
depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and 
(2) inhalants and other similar substances; 
(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a 
manner that deviates from approved medical direction. 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 25(a), “any drug abuse (see above definition),” is potentially disqualifying.  In 
addition, AG ¶ 25(c) may apply where there is “illegal drug possession, including 
cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of 
drug paraphernalia.” Similarly, under AG ¶ 25(g), “any illegal drug use after being 
granted a security clearance,” may raise security concerns. Appellant used marijuana 
on a variety of occasions while holding a security clearance with access to SCI granted 
by another Government agency. As noted above, Applicant has given several different 
descriptions of such use as to the period and frequency. The use was variously 
described as unspecified frequency during 1996 to at least 2005; seven occasions 
between 1996 and 2006; and approximately ten times between January 1999 and 
August 2005. She obtained and used marijuana in social settings. She also claimed the 
use was motivated by the stress of family problems and her divorce. Regardless of her 
motivation, and the inconsistencies in the descriptions of the period and frequency of 
such use, her possession of marijuana violated the law and her marijuana possession 
and use violated organizational policy. AG ¶¶ 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. 
 The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG ¶ 26(a), the disqualifying condition 
 
9 
                                      
 
                                                          
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on 
the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG ¶ 
26(b), drug involvement concerns may also be mitigated where there is “a demonstrated 
intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,” such as:  
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  
(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and 
(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any 
violation. 
Similarly, under AG ¶ 26(d), “satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment 
program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without 
recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical 
professional,” the drug involvement concerns may be mitigated.  
Appellant’s 10-year period of marijuana use, commenced when she was 50 
years old, and continued at least until she was 59 years old – long after she could be 
considered an impressionable minor whose actions were unfortunate youthful 
indiscretions. Moreover, her motivation for using marijuana in social settings was 
supposedly to handle the stresses of family problems and a divorce. However, as she 
noted, her parents passed away three years after she started using marijuana and she 
continued using it until eight months before her second divorce. Her use of marijuana 
occurred despite her having been briefed on the organizational drug policy, and while 
she held a security clearance with access to SCI granted by another Government 
agency.  
 
Applicant’s last admitted marijuana use occurred in 2005 or 2006 – at least four 
years before this decision. Her inconsistent statements regarding the period and 
frequency of her marijuana use raise some questions, as there are no “bright line” rules 
for determining when such conduct is “recent.” The determination must be based “on a 
careful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the 
directive.”56 For example, the Appeal Board has determined that an applicant’s last use 
of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent.57 If 
the evidence shows “a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of 
misconduct,” then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time 
demonstrates “changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of 
56 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). 
 
57 ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997). 
 
 
10 
                                      
 
                                                          
reform or rehabilitation.”58 Likewise, given Applicant’s vague explanations, without 
specifics, it is also difficult to conclude that her marijuana use “happened under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.” Her actions, under the circumstances, cast 
doubt on Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Her drug 
involvement warrants partial application of AG ¶ 26(a). 
AG ¶¶ 26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) apply for Applicant has demonstrated a 
“disassociation from drug-using associates;” has supposedly “changed or avoided the 
environment” where the marijuana was used; and she has abstained from further 
marijuana use since 2005 or 2006, depending on which version of the facts one 
accepts. AG ¶ 26(b)(4), does not apply because there is no evidence that Applicant 
ever signed “a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any 
violation.” 
AG ¶ 26(d) does not apply because there is no evidence that Applicant 
completed a “prescribed drug treatment program.”  
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG & 15:       
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  
 
58 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6, supra note 56. In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), 
the Appeal Board reversed the judge’s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the absence of drug use for five 
years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge excessively emphasized the drug use while 
holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and 
therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board stated:  
 
Compare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage of three 
years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel the administrative 
judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by 
failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that mitigating condition in light of 
the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 
2002) (“The administrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts about the 
sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.”) (citation format corrections added). 
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency analysis of an 
administrative judge stating: 
 
The administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of improper 
or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security clearance process. 
That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year from 1974 to 2002 [drug use 
ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal purchase of marijuana and the use of 
marijuana while holding a security clearance.

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 16(a), a “deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used 
to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or 
status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary 
responsibilities,” is potentially disqualifying. In addition, under AG ¶ 16(b), “deliberately 
providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, 
investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government 
representative,” may raise security concerns. Similarly, under AG ¶ 16(e), “personal 
conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, that creates a vulnerability 
to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if 
known, may affect the person’s personal, professional, or community standing . . . .” 
may raise security concerns. Applicant’s deliberate omission, concealment, and 
falsification of critical information pertaining to her drug use, especially while holding a 
security clearance with access to SCI provides sufficient evidence to examine if her 
omissions were deliberate falsifications or were the result of simple oversight or 
negligence on her part.59  
 
As noted above, although Applicant had been previously briefed on the 
organization’s drug policy, she failed to comply with both the prohibition of drug use and 
the requirement that any such use be reported. When offered opportunities to be 
candid, she furnished several different explanations for her actions. In October 2006, 
Applicant stated she did not report her drug use because she did not consider it to be 
“habitual” and she thought she might “get into trouble.” In October 2007, she contended 
she neglected to list her drug use “due to oversight.” In December 2010, Applicant 
claimed she “just checked the box on the form without really thinking of what [she] did.” 
However, in her answer to the Amended SOR, she admitted her “no” response to the 
question was deliberate. AG ¶¶ 16(a), 16(b), and 16(e) have been established. 
 
The guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from personal conduct under AG ¶¶ 17(a)-(g). But in this instance, 
none of the mitigating conditions apply.  
 
59 The Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of proving 
falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s 
intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record 
evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning the 
applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally 
permissible for the Judge to conclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case 
under Guideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to 
explain the omission.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She was under 
stress due to family problems and because of a difficult marriage that ended in divorce. 
While she continued to use marijuana over a 10-year period to handle her stress, she 
eventually abstained from further marijuana use in 2005 or 2006, and has not used it 
since that time. She has also disassociated herself from other known drug users. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. 
Applicant has a 10-year history of drug involvement while she held a security clearance 
with access to SCI. Drug use is illegal. She failed to comply with both the prohibition of 
drug use and the requirement that any such use be reported. When questioned about 
drug involvement, she lied. When offered opportunities to be candid, she furnished 
several different explanations for her actions. In reviewing her alternative responses, 
two stand out: (1) she did not report her drug use because she did not consider it to be 
“habitual” and she thought she might “get into trouble;” and (2), she admitted her 
response in her SF 86 was deliberate. Taken together, her conduct over the years 
vitiates any other mitigation. See AG && 2(a)(1) through  2(a)(9). 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing the 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude she has failed to mitigate the personal conduct 
security concerns.  She has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to drug 
involvement. The financial considerations are no longer security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
   
Paragraph 2, Guideline H:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 3, Guideline F:   WITHDRAWN 
 
  Subparagraph 3.a:    Withdrawn 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
