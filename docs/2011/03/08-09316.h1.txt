GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 17, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a 
Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions version of a Security Clearance Application (SF 
86).1 On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
her a set of interrogatories pertaining to her finances. She responded to the 
interrogatories on March 23, 2009.2 On March 2, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
1 Item 4 (SF 86), dated April 17, 2008. 
 
2 Item 7 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated March 23, 2009).

Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 12, 2010. In a sworn 
statement, dated April 6, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected 
to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of 
the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on 
November 4, 2010, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days 
after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on September 22, 2010, and 
elected not to make any additional submissions. The case was assigned to me on 
January 14, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.h., 1.l., and 1.n. through 1.t.) of 
the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the 
remaining allegations (¶¶ 1.i. through 1.k., and 1.m.) of the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a “supervisor” with a nationwide communications company, and she is seeking to obtain 
a security clearance.3 She has never had a security clearance.4 She has not served in 
the U.S. military.5 Although Applicant considered herself unemployed from August 1990 
until December 1999,6 in reality, she was a stay-at-home mom.7 During a portion of that 
period (from July 1998 until February 1999) she was employed as program aide for a 
company, and (from February 1999 to December 1999) she was an assistant manager 
for the same company.8 From December 1999 until May 2001, Applicant was employed 
as a manager by another company.9 She was unemployed from May 2001 until July

2001.10 From July 2001 until September 2001 she was a nurse assistant,11 and was 
self-employed as a shop owner from September 2001 until June 2004.12 She was also 
a factory worker from June 2002 until October 2002.13 Applicant was a part time 
consultant from June 2004 until December 2005,14 and from December 2005 until 
January 2007, she was a credit collections specialist.15 In January 2007 she joined 
another company as a supervisor, and remained there until March 2008.16 It is unclear 
when Applicant joined her current employer as a supervisor.17  
 
During the period August 2006 until at least May 2008, Applicant was enrolled in 
an online distance learning program at a technical university where she earned two 
certificates of achievement.18 Her estimated graduation date was February 2009,19 but 
there is no evidence that the graduation took place. 
 
Applicant has been in several marital or spouse-like relationships. She was 
married in April 1990 and had two sons, born in 1990 and 1994, respectively.20 She and 
her husband were divorced in September 1998.21 She maintained a spouse-like 
relationship from May 2001 until July 2001, and again from an unspecified point in 2005 
until at least April 2008, during which time she was supported by her friend and by child 
support from her ex-husband.22 She and her friend have one child together.23 She was 
also in a spouse-like relationship with another friend from June 2005 to October 2005, 
during which time her boyfriend paid the rent.24

Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties. In 
March 1998, she filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under the provisions of 
Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.25 On July 7, 1998, an unspecified number of 
debts, with unspecified balances, were discharged.26 The identity of the creditors has 
not been revealed. Applicant contends the debts were those of her husband before their 
marriage as well as marital debts.27 At some unspecified point after 1998, accounts 
started to again become delinquent, and some of the accounts were placed for 
collection with a variety of collection agents, and some of the accounts were charged 
off. One delinquent account went to judgment. In June 2003, she filed a voluntary 
petition for bankruptcy under the provisions of Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy 
Code.28 That bankruptcy was dismissed in December 2003.29 It is unclear if Applicant 
made any payments under the bankruptcy, and the reasons for the dismissal were not 
specified, although Applicant believes it was because of her 1998 bankruptcy which was 
only five years earlier.30 
 
On several occasions between 2001 and 2003, Applicant wrote non-sufficient 
fund (NSF) checks on a joint checking account which she maintained with her friend.31 
She subsequently was cited, pled guilty, and was fined for each of the NSF offenses.32 
Applicant attributed her actions to her friend’s failure to update the account records to 
reflect his automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals, and her lack of awareness that 
she was issuing bad checks.33 
 
In May 2008, while being interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of 
Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant acknowledged a number of delinquent 
accounts for medical bills which arose between 2001 and 2004, during a period when 
her business was not successful and she had no healthcare insurance.34 She also had 
a long-standing delinquent utility bill which she claimed to be disputing.35 There was

also a long-standing judgment since 2003.36 Applicant professed an intention to contact 
the creditors of her delinquent medical accounts and the judgment in order to start 
making payments.37  
 
On several occasions in mid-2008, Applicant wrote credit reporting agencies and 
collection agencies in efforts to dispute multiple reporting of the same legitimate 
accounts and seeking validation and verification of various charges.38 As a result, some 
accounts were removed from Experian and TransUnion credit reports, but they 
remained on Equifax credit reports. Applicant disputed one account (SOR ¶ 1.a.), with 
an identified account number, because the SOR alleged the unpaid balance was $127, 
while one credit report indicated the balance was $120 and a credit report from the 
following year said it was $127. The basis for her dispute was that she had dental 
insurance that should have covered the charges and the dollar amount was slightly 
different.39 She disputed another dental account (SOR ¶ 1.c.) in the amount of $1,705, 
claiming “multiple inaccuracies,” but did not specify what those inaccuracies were.40 
She tried to settle that account but the collection agency did not reply to her dispute.41 
Applicant also disputed a 2003 judgment (SOR ¶ 1.l.) in the amount of $5,560, claiming 
she should not have been liable for charges related to the early termination of a lease 
for her business, and then added a comment that the judgment no longer appears on 
one credit report.42 Applicant disputed one account (SOR ¶ 1.n.) pertaining to a 
repossessed automobile in the amount of $34,029, claiming the debt was too old and it 
was not legitimate.43 She contended there was unethical conduct by the automobile 
dealer and stated that her disputes in 2008 resulted in the removal of the adverse listing 
from TransUnion and Experian credit reports.44 She disputed the account with Equifax 
in February 2009, and as of December 2009, the adverse entry is no longer listed by 
Equifax.45 As to the other delinquent accounts that were charged off or which were 
removed from her credit reports because they were more than seven years old, she has 
no intention of pursuing those creditors to resolve the delinquent accounts.46

Two of Applicant’s sons attend a cost-free, private, coeducational home and 
school for children from families of low income, limited resources, and social need.47 In 
May 2004, she took a one-week overseas vacation to a Caribbean island which she 
paid for herself.48 
 
The SOR identified 18 continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit reports 
from 200849 and 2009,50 totaling approximately $44,710. Among the delinquencies are 
accounts pertaining to medical providers, a repossessed automobile (with a delinquent 
balance of $34,029), utility service, and credit cards. Some accounts have been 
transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts 
are referenced repeatedly in the different credit reports, in many instances duplicating 
other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor 
name. Some accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are 
identified by partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits, 
and in others eliminating other digits.  
 
Applicant contends she has paid three of the accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.i., 1.j., and 
1.m.) and claims “there are duplicates” for the collection agency regarding SOR ¶ 1.b. 
However, she has failed to provide documentation to support her contentions or explain 
which of the other accounts with the one particular collection agency are duplicates. The 
2008 combined credit report clearly lists the same accounts separately by credit 
reporting agency, but Applicant has offered no evidence to support her contention that 
accounts are listed repeatedly in the SOR. To date, Applicant has produced no 
evidence to indicate that she has contacted her remaining creditors, established 
repayment plans, or commenced making any payments. 
 
 There is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling covering 
such topics as debt consolidation, money management, repayment plans, or budgeting, 
and it is unclear if she ever received any such counseling in conjunction with her 1998 
or 2003 bankruptcy filings.  
 
 On March 17, 2009, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement,51 
indicating a monthly net income, including child support, of $4,550.10;52 $2,545.90 in 
monthly living expenses;53 and debt payments of $750.01;54 with a monthly net

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”57 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”58   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view tshe guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”59 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation,

2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.60  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”61 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”62 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . .

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns.  
 
As noted above, it is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial 
difficulties. At some unspecified point, she failed to keep up with her monthly payments, 
and accounts started to become delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection 
and some accounts were charged off. In July 1998, her debts were discharged under 
Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Five years later, financial problems again 
arose, when she failed to keep up with her monthly payments, and accounts started to 
become delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection and some accounts were 
charged off. One went to judgment. In June 2003, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but that petition was dismissed in December 
2003. As to some of her delinquent accounts, especially those that were charged off or 
which were removed from her credit reports because they were more than seven years 
old, Applicant indicated that she has no intention of pursuing those creditors to resolve 
the delinquent accounts. The record is silent as to why Applicant’s remaining delinquent 
accounts remained largely unaddressed by her after she secured gainful employment in 
2001, and she did not start paying off her delinquent debts. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) 
apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@63 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
63 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
Applicant’s financial problems commenced some time before 1998, and although 
resolved by a discharge of her debts under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 
July 1998, they reappeared some time before 2003, and still have not been resolved. 
While she attributed some of her continuing financial difficulties initially to her ex-
husband’s premarital debts as well as their marital debts, an unsuccessful business 
venture, and periods of unemployment, she never explained why she failed to resolve or 
even address nearly all of her delinquent accounts for long periods of time, especially 
after she became gainfully employed in 2001. Considering her ability to spend money 
on a Caribbean vacation in 2004, as well as her ownership of a timeshare, it appears 
that she is unconcerned that her delinquent accounts are still unresolved. Because the 
financial situation is frequent and continuing in nature, and the continuing causation is 
not adequately described, AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. Applicant’s handling of her 
finances, under the circumstances, casts doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies because of Applicant’s occasional periods of 
unemployment, her divorce, and her failed business venture.  Applicant had no debts 
following her 1998 bankruptcy, yet she incurred additional debt which eventually 
became delinquent. While she claims one lengthy period of unemployment, she was 
actually a stay-at-home mother. During other periods, she cohabited with her friends 
and they supported her. Moreover, sufficient time has passed since she generated her 
bills and obtained employment, and she still has not addressed most of her delinquent 
accounts, preferring to dispute them or simply wait for them to drop off her credit 
reports. The reasons stated do not establish she acted “responsibly under the 
circumstances.”  
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because there is no clear evidence establishing that 
Applicant actually received financial counseling.  
 
Applicant receives very limited application of AG ¶ 20(d) because, with few 
exceptions, she failed to address her delinquent accounts except by disputing them. 
With a monthly net remainder of $1,254.19 available for discretionary spending, it was 
possible that Applicant could have commenced the payment of some delinquent 
accounts. Nevertheless, the vast majority of them remain unpaid or unresolved. She is, 
instead, waiting for her debts to be removed from her credit reports as they become 
older than seven years, and she has no intention of pursuing those creditors to resolve 
the delinquent accounts.64 While there were some indications that she intended to

repay some of her delinquent debts eventually, as well as some indications that some 
debts may have been paid, partially or otherwise, she has offered no documentation to 
indicate the terms of her repayment agreements, or any indication from the various 
collection agencies that they have agreed to her proposed terms, or to confirm that such 
agreements exist or existed. In the absence of such documentation, most of the 
evidence consists of promises to pay or unsupported contentions that some creditors 
may have been paid. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because while Applicant has furnished documented 
proof of her disputed accounts, the basis of her disputes (the credit reports list the same 
accounts multiple times, or she had health insurance, or she should not be responsible 
for a broken lease, even though the matter went to judgment) do not address the 
gravamen of the disputes, to wit, the accounts were not Applicant’s or she has a legal 
basis not to pay certain accounts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Some of her 
pre-1998 delinquent accounts were attributed to her ex-husband; she had an 
unsuccessful business; and she went through periods of unemployment. She also 
successfully disputed some of her delinquent accounts, causing them to be removed 
from her credit reports.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. 
Applicant has a history of financial delinquencies. She failed to address her current 
financial responsibilities, and simply emphasized her difficult marriage, unsuccessful 
 
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

business, and unemployment to explain her financial difficulties. As noted above, 
Applicant’s stated intention was to dispute some delinquent accounts because they 
were listed multiple times in various credit reports, and wait until other delinquent 
accounts reached the seven-year point and would automatically be removed from her 
credit reports. Even though she has sufficient funds each month to make substantial 
payments in an effort to resolve her accounts and the judgment, she has chosen not to 
do so. A Caribbean vacation and a timeshare are more important. Applicant’s actions 
reflect traits which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.65 Her limited good-faith efforts 
are insufficient to mitigate continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 
2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
