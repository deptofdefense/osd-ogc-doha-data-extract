GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 9, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On September 15, 2009, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished her a set of interrogatories. She responded to 
the interrogatories on an unspecified date.2  On an unspecified date, DOHA furnished 
her another set of interrogatories. She responded to the interrogatories on November 
17, 2009.3 On April 12, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated October 9, 2008.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, undated).

pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the Department of 
Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other determinations 
made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F 
(Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 21, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on May 20, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on June 25, 2010, and the case was assigned to 
me on June 28, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on July 1, 2010, and I convened 
the hearing, as scheduled, on July 14, 2010.4 
 
 During the hearing, eight Government exhibits (GE 1-8) and five Applicant 
exhibits (AE A-E) were admitted into evidence, without objection. Applicant testified. 
The record remained open to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on 
July 28, 2010, she submitted seven documents that were admitted into evidence (AE F-
L), without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 22, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted several of the factual allegations 
(¶¶ 1.f., 1.j., 1.y., and 1.z.) of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated herein as 
findings of fact. She denied the remaining allegations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e., 1.g. through 
1.i., and 1.k. through 1.x.). 
 
Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She serves as the 
lead supply technician,5 and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. She is a June 
1998 high school graduate,6 with four years of additional credits at a local college.7 
Since she was 12 years old, Applicant has worked in a variety of full-time and part-time 
positions over the years.8 She enlisted in the U.S. Army in July 1998, reenlisted in

September 2001, and served honorably until March 2006, when she received an 
honorable discharge.9 Applicant was unemployed from March 2006 until October 
2006.10 She returned to the workforce with her current employer in October 2006, and 
has held a number of different positions within the company since she was hired.11  
 
Applicant has been married since November 2006,12 and she has two children, 
born in 2005 and 2009, respectively.13 Her husband, currently serving on active duty 
with the U.S. Army, has four other children.14 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant contends that there was nothing unusual about her finances until her 
mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness in 1999, and Applicant’s stepfather 
abandoned her mother in 2000.15 When she was 20 years old, Applicant decided to 
assist her ailing mother and two younger sisters, financially.16 Initially it was casual 
support, but at some point in 2000-2001, the financial support became more 
substantial.17 Until her mother’s needs were settled and she obtained a fixed income in 
about 2004, Applicant paid for her mother’s rent, food, an automobile, auto insurance, 
school clothing for her sisters, prescriptions, and medical support.18 Applicant estimated 
that between 2000 and 2004, about half of her monthly income was dedicated to her 
mother and sisters.19 Since 2004, the support has diminished to about $200 per pay 
period.20 Because Applicant has no father or brothers to assist the family, and she is the 
oldest sibling, she is considered the family “go-to-person.”21 As such, she continues to

provide some financial assistance for the family.22 In an effort to provide additional 
assistance, in 2003 she applied for and received a compassionate reassignment.23 
 
Because she was diverting one half of her income from being applied to her own 
bills, Applicant failed to keep up with her monthly payments, causing accounts to 
become delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection with a variety of 
collection agents, some were charged off, and some became adverse judgments. 
Faced with overwhelming financial difficulties, Applicant sought guidance from her 
friends and was told to file for bankruptcy.24 On September 5, 2002, she filed a 
voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.25 She 
cited $13,525 in assets and $40,925.67 in liabilities.26 Among her assets was a $13,100 
2000 automobile.27 Among her liabilities were medical accounts, utility accounts, a 
cable television account, a student loan, personal loans and credit card accounts, and a 
gym membership.28 Under the bankruptcy plan, Applicant was to make specified 
payments to the bankruptcy trustee, but she was unable to do so.29 At the time, 
Applicant was delinquent in the amount of $1,404.30 Subsequently, upon discussing her 
finances with her first sergeant, she was advised that the filing for bankruptcy was “the 
worse thing [she] could have done.”31 She attempted to “reverse” the bankruptcy, and 
withdrew her opposition to the trustee’s motion to dismiss the bankruptcy, and on 
February 21, 2003, the case 32
 
In December 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and she indicated she was planning to go to a 
debt counselor in order to address her delinquent accounts.33 She eventually signed up 
for a two week course on financial education, but did not actually attend it because she 
could not afford to be off from work that long.34 In November 2009, she started to obtain 
“financial tutoring” from a financial counselor at the facility soldier support center for

about one hour at a time over a period of about six months.35 That tutoring consisted of 
debt management and budgeting, but did not yet include debt consolidation.36 As part of 
that program, on an unspecified date, Applicant prepared a monthly budget worksheet 
indicating total family income, including child support received, totaling $5,078; and 
$4,180 in monthly expenses.37 Based on those figures, it appears that she has $2,608 
available each month for discretionary spending.38 She no longer uses credit cards, has 
no car loans, and is current on all other non-SOR financial accounts.39 
 
The SOR identified 25 continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit reports 
from 200940 and 201041 totaling approximately $32,591. Some accounts listed in the 
credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection 
agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in these credit reports, in many 
instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or 
under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by complete account 
numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some instances 
eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. Some accounts 
reflect no account number.  
 
The delinquent accounts include a number of accounts about which Applicant 
previously claimed to have no knowledge,42 or which she informally disputed. She has 
offered no documentary evidence to support her contention that she actually formally 
disputed any delinquent accounts. In January 2009, when Applicant again spoke with 
the OPM investigator, she acknowledged that her financial condition was embarrassing, 
promised to take control of her credit, and clean up her financial delinquencies.43 
Although Applicant has funds available each month for discretionary spending, and 
despite promises by her to pay off the delinquent accounts, to date, she has made very 
little progress regarding payments to the creditors.  
 
As to the accounts listed in the SOR, based on the evidence before me, I 
conclude that Applicant has resolved only three of the delinquent accounts in the SOR

(¶¶ 1,e.,44 1.f.,45 and 1.g.46). In addition, Applicant was offered a reduced settlement 
figure from $6,665 to $1,505.65 by one collection agent (¶ 1.y.), but the offer was 
contingent upon full payment no later than August 28, 2009.47 Applicant offered no 
evidence to indicate the offer had been acted upon in a timely manner with the account 
resolved. In fact, to the contrary, Applicant stated she initially informally disputed the 
debt but subsequently made no effort to resolve it.48 She has made minimal recent 
efforts to contact or resolve the remaining 21 SOR accounts.49 
 
Character References and Work Performance 
 
 During her military career, Applicant was awarded the Army Achievement Medal 
on two occasions, Army Good Conduct Medal on two occasions, National Defense 
Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Noncommissioned Officer 
Professional Development Ribbon on two occasions, and Army Service Ribbon.50 Two 
of Applicant’s coworkers and the facility accountable officer are familiar with her and 
characterize her in favorable terms. Applicant demonstrates loyalty, commitment, 
professionalism, generous spirit, integrity, enthusiasm, initiative, ethics, reliability, and 
moral character, and is a hardworking person who is well respected.51 In February 
2010, Applicant’s employer presented her with an award for exceptional teamwork and 
support of a project during December 2009.52 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”53 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his

designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”54   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”55 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.56  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”57

support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”58 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, Applicant contends that there was nothing unusual 
about her finances until her mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness in 1999, and 
Applicant’s stepfather abandoned her mother in 2000. At the age of 20, Applicant 
started assisting her ailing mother and two younger sisters, financially. Until about 2004, 
Applicant essentially supported her mother and her two younger sisters, and between 
2000 and 2004, about half of her monthly income was dedicated to them. In doing so, 
she was unable to address her own accounts, and they became delinquent. Some 
accounts were placed for collection, some were charged off, and some became adverse 
judgments. With the exception of three SOR accounts, the remaining 21 accounts are 
still in a delinquent status. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
58 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
9 
                                      
 
                                                          
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@59 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
As noted above, Applicant’s financial problems commenced after her mother was 
diagnosed with a terminal illness in 1999, and Applicant’s stepfather abandoned her 
mother in 2000. Until about 2004, Applicant essentially supported her mother and her 
two younger sisters, and between 2000 and 2004, about half of her monthly income was 
dedicated to them. In doing so, she was unable to address her own accounts, and they 
became delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection, some were charged off, 
and some became adverse judgments. Additionally, Applicant was unemployed from 
March 2006 until October 2006. She has remained gainfully employed since October 
2006. Applicant has acknowledged limited effective resolution of her delinquent 
accounts. Her failure to timely handle her bills has exacerbated her financial meltdown. 
Because she has multiple delinquent debts and her financial problems are continuing in 
nature, she receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(a). While Applicant has exhibited 
the noble virtues of being a good daughter and older sister, she failed to ensure her own 
debts were paid.  
 
Applicant receives partial application of AG ¶ 20(b), for while she supported her 
ailing mother and two younger sisters essentially for four years, and was herself 
unemployed during March 2006 until October 2006 – factors that were clearly 
circumstances beyond her control – as it pertains to her finances, Applicant failed to act 
responsibly under the circumstances. Moreover, after obtaining employment in October 
2006, she offered little evidence to indicate why circumstances did not improve 
59 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

substantially over the ensuing four years to enable her to resolve her debts and reduce 
her delinquencies.60  
 
AG & 20(c) partially applies because Applicant has received some general form 
of financial counseling or budget guidance from a credit counselor and as a prerequisite 
before filing her Chapter 13 bankruptcy.61 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies because, to date, Applicant made little proven efforts 
to address her delinquent accounts. In fact, she resolved only three of her accounts out 
of the 25 alleged in the SOR. There is limited documentary evidence to support 
Applicant’s contentions that she contacted her creditors to try to make repayment 
arrangements. To the contrary, she admitted that with the exception of the three 
accounts resolved, she made no recent efforts to contact her creditors or their 
respective collection agents. Instead, she talked about doing so, promised to do so, and 
actually filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in an effort 
to launch a repayment plan. That plan was abandoned in 2003. Thereafter, with the 
exception of the three resolved accounts, Applicant did not act aggressively, timely, or 
responsibly in an effort to resolve the remaining delinquent debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant has not provided documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of any disputed account. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
60 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).  
 
61 See 11 U.S.C. § 109(h): 
. . . an individual may not be a debtor under this title unless such individual has, during the 180-day 
period preceding the date of filing of the petition by such individual, received from an approved 
nonprofit budget and credit counseling agency described in section 111(a) an individual or group 
briefing (including a briefing conducted by telephone or on the Internet) that outlined the 
opportunities for available credit counseling and assisted such individual in performing a related 
budget analysis.

rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is substantial evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When 
Applicant undertook the financial responsibilities for her ailing mother and younger 
sisters, she was 20 years old, when she was too young to be made responsible for 
others. She exhibited the characteristics of being a very good and responsible daughter 
and older sister. And she experienced a lengthy period of unemployment in 2006. After 
a period of inaction during which she did not address her creditors, according to 
Applicant, she initiated some efforts to address her accounts. Now married and a 
mother, she has assumed the additional responsibilities of a homemaker. She has a 
written budget. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While her mother’s situation and that of her two younger sisters, along with Applicant’s 
2006 unemployment, were circumstances beyond her control, Applicant either had no 
ability or no intention to pay her delinquent accounts. She did not make any payments 
to her creditors. Despite the passage of time, there is no documentation to support her 
contentions that she had contacted her creditors. Her long-standing failure to repay 
creditors, at least in reasonable amounts, or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits 
which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance.  
 
I am mindful that any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s 
credit history in a sympathetic light. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.62 Her insufficient good-faith efforts or documentary evidence to reflect actual 
payments to her SOR creditors are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See 
AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:63 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
62 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial 
considerations.

 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
