MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant incurred delinquent debt starting in 2007 after being granted a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge in 1999. She has begun repaying her past-due debts, but it is too soon 
to conclude that her financial problems are behind her. Personal conduct concerns persist 
because of her false response to the bankruptcy inquiry on a January 2005 security 
clearance application (SF 86) and her omission of any delinquent debt when she applied for 
a clearance for her current job in June 2009. Clearance denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 25, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, which provided the basis for 
its preliminary decision to deny her a security clearance. DOHA acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

Applicant answered the SOR on April 16, 2010, and requested a hearing. On June 
30, 2010, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On July 2, 2010, I 
scheduled a hearing for July 21, 2010. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence, the 
SOR was amended on motion of Department Counsel and without objection to allege in 
SOR 2.a through 2.d that Applicant falsified a Questionnaire for National Positions (QNSP) 
dated June 1, 2009 (vice June 10, 2009), and to allege in SOR 2.e through 2.g that 
Applicant falsified a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) dated January 7, 2005 (vice 
January 13, 2005). Eight Government exhibits (Ex. 1-8) were admitted. Applicant expressed 
concerns about the relevance of the charges reflected in Exhibit 8, a criminal history record, 
given her probation was terminated and she was discharged. The exhibit was accepted over 
Applicant‟s objection as it was relevant to the falsification allegations in SOR 2.d and 2.g. 
Three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C) were entered into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on July 30, 2010. 
 
 At Applicant‟s request, I held the record open until August 4, 2010, for her to submit 
additional documents. Six additional documents were timely received and entered as 
exhibits (Ex. D-I) without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR as amended alleges under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as 
of March 25, 2010, Applicant owed $15,238 in delinquent consumer credit debt (SOR 1.a–
1.f) after a September 1999 bankruptcy discharge (SOR 1.g). Under Guideline E, Applicant 
allegedly falsified her June 1, 2009 QNSP
1
 by not disclosing that she had been over 180 
days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years and that she was currently over 90 
days delinquent on any debts (SOR 2.a); that any of her debts had been turned over for 
collection (SOR 2.b); that any of her accounts or credit cards had been charged off or 
cancelled for failing to pay as agreed (SOR 2.c); and that she had been charged with felony 
assault and battery in September 1997 (SOR 2.d). Applicant was also alleged to have 
falsified her January 7, 2005 SF 86 by not disclosing her Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing (SOR 
2.e); that she had been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the seven years 
preceding her SF 86 and that she was 90 days delinquent on debts as of her SF 86 (SOR 
2.f); and that she had been arrested and convicted of the September 1997 felony assault 
and battery in response to any felony arrests and any arrests within the preceding seven 
years (SOR 2.g). 
 
Applicant admitted the bankruptcy and the debts alleged with the exception of SOR 
1.b, about which she lacked information. Repayment arrangements had been made for the 
debts in SOR 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f. Concerning the alleged falsifications of her e-QIP and SF 86 
forms, Applicant indicated that she did not have the information in her possession at the

The QNSP is incorporated in an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) signed by 
Applicant on June 1, 2009.

time that she completed her e-QIP, although she also admitted that she “made a mistake” 
by not disclosing the extent of her credit card delinquencies (SOR 2.a and 2.f), including not 
indicating that accounts had gone to collection (SOR 2.b). She attributed her failure to 
disclose any cancelled or charged off accounts to mail getting lost or not being forwarded in 
time when she moved (SOR 2.c). Applicant averred that she answered the criminal record 
inquiries on her e-QIP (SOR 2.d) and SF 86 (SOR 2.g) accurately because she had no 
charges against her when she completed the forms and her arrest was not within the seven-
year scope of the 2005 SF 86. She indicated that her bankruptcy had been discharged over 
ten years ago (SOR 2.e). 
 
After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings 
of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old security guard, who has worked as a line officer at the 
same facility since February 2007. In March 2008, she became employed by an offsite 
defense contractor, and she requires a security clearance for her duties. (Ex. 1.) 
 
Applicant married her first husband in April 1981. In September 1981, she entered 
active duty in the U.S. Air Force, and she and her husband had a son born abroad in 
September 1982. Applicant was discharged from the military two months later. (Ex. 2.) In 
November 1983, she and her first husband divorced, and he died in August 1984. (Ex. 1, 2.) 
Applicant entered into a second marriage that also ended in divorce.
2
 (Ex. 1, 2.) After her 
divorce, Applicant held low-paying jobs. She relied heavily on credit cards to meet some 
expenses, such as food and toys. (Ex. 3.) 
 
In September 1997, Applicant was charged with felony assault and battery with a 
dangerous weapon (a stick), and with assault and battery on a household member (her 
son). In late August 1997, she and her then boyfriend had lost their tempers with her son, 
who has special needs, and she struck him with a stick. (Ex. 3.) Applicant‟s mother, who 
lived in a nearby apartment, noticed that her grandson had bruising on his buttocks and she 
contacted the police. The state awarded temporary custody of Applicant‟s son to his 
grandmother. In December 1997, Applicant admitted sufficient facts on both charges. Her 
case was continued without a finding until December 3, 1999, on the conditions that she 
complete parenting classes with the state‟s department of social services (DSS), and 
comply with DSS‟ terms for visitation. On December 6, 1999, she was discharged from 
probation, and the charges were dismissed. (Ex. 3, 8, A.) 
 
Around April 1998, Applicant incurred joint liability for an auto loan of $30,530. The 
loan payments were not made on time, and the vehicle was repossessed leaving a 
deficiency balance of $25,101. (Ex. 5.) By 1999, Applicant could no longer manage her 
credit card debt. In May 1999, she filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, listing credit card debt. She 
was granted a discharge in September 1999. Applicant believes that the car debt may well 
have been included in her bankruptcy, although it was listed as delinquent as of November 
2000 on a February 2005 credit report. (Ex. 3, 5.) 
                                                 
2
Applicant provided discrepant information about the dates of her second marriage. She indicated on her 
January 2005 SF 86 that she was married in July 1986 and divorced in June 1993. (Ex. 2.) On her June 2009 e-
QIP, she provided estimated dates for her second marriage, from July 1984 to June 1987.  (Ex. 1.) 
 
 4 
 
Applicant worked as an assembler/solderer until June 2001, when she was laid off 
from the technology company where she had been working for the past two years. (Ex. 1, 
2.) She enrolled in a local community college while working as a cashier for a supermarket. 
(Ex. 1.) Over the next few years, she opened several credit card accounts with low limits to 
reestablish her credit. (Ex. 5.) In June 2003, she stopped attending classes. In September 
2003, she started working as a security officer at an office park. (Ex. 1, 2.) 
 
 In June 2004, Applicant and her son began cohabitating with family members to 
reduce her living expenses. (Ex. 1, 2, 3.) In January 2005, Applicant applied for work as a 
security guard/officer for a defense contractor. She signed an SF 86 on January 7, 2005, on 
which she responded “NO” to the police record inquiries, including question 21, “Have you 
ever been charged with or convicted of any felony offense?,” and 26, “In the last 7 years, 
have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in 
modules 21, 22, 23, 24, or 25?.” Applicant also answered “NO” to the financial record 
questions, including 33, “In the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any chapter of 
the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?,” 38, “In the last 7 years, have you been over 
180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?,” and 39, “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent 
on any debt(s)?.” (Ex. 2.) 
 
 A check of Applicant‟s credit on February 8, 2005, revealed the 1999 bankruptcy 
discharge and vehicle repossession debt. A revolving charge account opened in September 
1995 had been closed and transferred, but with no balance due and other debts had been 
paid off satisfactorily. Applicant was making timely payments of $187 per month on a car 
loan of $11,283 that she had taken out in July 2004, and on two credit card accounts that 
had outstanding balances of $371 and $662. (Ex. 5.) 
 
 Applicant continued to work full-time as a security guard at the office complex. In 
September 2005, she began supplementing her income through weekend hours (16 hours 
per week) for the defense contractor. In January 2006, Applicant resigned from her full-time 
job because she thought she had another position lined up, but it fell through. (Ex. 3.) She 
netted only $121.61 per week from her part-time job with the defense contractor as of 
February 2006, but she was able to cover living expenses for herself and her son for that 
month because of his social security benefit. (Ex. 3.) 
 
 On February 9, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator about 
her arrest and her finances. She attributed her omission of her arrest from her January 2005 
SF 86 to not recalling the specific charges filed against her in 1997, not knowing that she 
had been charged with a felony offense, and she may not have read the questions on her 
SF 86 thoroughly. As for her finances, Applicant acknowledged that she had filed for 
bankruptcy in 1999 because of credit card debt that she incurred for necessities due to her 
low income. Concerning the repossession debt, Applicant indicated that she and her ex-
husband had two cars repossessed long before her bankruptcy and that the $25,101 debt 
may have been included in her bankruptcy. She indicated she had not heard from the 
creditor in the past decade. Applicant indicated that she did not list either the bankruptcy or 
repossession debt on her SF 86 because she thought they had happened over seven years 
ago. Applicant indicated in hindsight she should have kept a closer eye on her discretionary 
 
 5 
spending. She asserted that she was presently living within her means despite her recent 
resignation from her full-time job. She expected to pay her monthly expenses of $1,159 for 
March 2006 with her income tax refund. Applicant estimated that she had outstanding credit 
card balances totaling $4,100. Around December 2005, she cosigned on a cellular phone 
account for her niece, who ran up $1,900 in charges that were unpaid. (Ex. 3.) 
 
 From April 2006 to February 2007, Applicant worked as a cashier for a wholesale 
club. In September 2006, Applicant and her mother both cosigned on a student loan of 
$12,409 for Applicant‟s niece‟s education. Repayment of the loan was deferred while her 
niece was in school. (Ex. 6, D.) In February 2007, Applicant began full-time employment as 
a security guard/officer at her present duty location. (Ex. 1.) She made monthly payments 
on a credit card account opened in October 2005 with a credit limit of $6,000, and a balance 
of $3,145 as of May 2009. Yet over the next two years, some of her credit accounts became 
seriously delinquent, as set forth in the following table.

The Government alleged two separate credit card debts with the same bank (SOR 1.c and 1.d) because of 
different account numbers. Applicant recalls only one credit card account with the lender. (Ex. 4.) The evidence 
tends to indicate that SOR 1.c and 1.d pertain to the same debt (originally account xxxxxxxx0295) in good 
standing as of December 2004, but then placed for collection with agency X. As of June 2009, the account 
(xxxx0295xxxx) was reported as transferred and in collection with a zero balance. Agency X was reporting a 
debt from the bank in collection with a balance of $1,662, under account number x4149. (Ex. 6.) As of October 
2009, Experian (xxxxxxxx0295xxxx) and Equifax (xxxx0295xxxx) reported that the debt in SOR 1.c had a zero 
balance because the account had been transferred. Again, there was a separate listing under account 4149 in 
collection with agency X. As shown in Exhibit E, the account originally numbered xxxx0295xxxx had been in

 In February 2008, Applicant began working for her current employer.
4
 (Tr. 72.) 
Around May 25, 2009, Applicant was asked by her employer to apply for a security 
clearance. (Tr. 34.) She accessed the e-QIP form three or four times over a week before 
completing it on June 1, 2009. (Tr. 35.) She omitted any mention of her part-time work with 
a previous defense contractor for whom she had completed the SF 86 in 2005. She 
responded “No” to the police record inquiries, including 22.c, “Have you EVER been 
charged with a felony offense?” And she also answered “No” to the financial record inquiries 
which had a seven-year scope, including 26.g, “Have you had bills or debts turned over to a 
collection agency?,” 26.h, “Have you had an account or credit card suspended, charged off, 
or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?,” and 26.m, “Have you been over 180 days 
delinquent on any debt(s)?.” Applicant also responded negatively to question 26.n, “Are you 
currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” (Ex. 1.) 
 
 Applicant‟s credit report of June 19, 2009, revealed the outstanding collection debts 
identified in SOR 1.a, 1.d (also alleged under original creditor in SOR 1.c), 1.e, and 1.f (also 
alleged under original creditor in SOR 1.b). (Ex. 6.) On July 16, 2009, Applicant was asked 
about those debts and her failure to disclose them on her e-QIP. She admitted knowing that 
that the debts in SOR 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e went into collections in the past two or three years. 
When able, she had made some payments on the debts in SOR 1.a and 1.d. She had 
inquired about debt consolidation two or three years ago but would have had to pay the firm 
$300 a month for six months before any of her creditors would be repaid. Applicant added 
                                                                                                                                                               
collection with agency X. It had a current balance of $1,222.40.  Applicant‟s June 2010 credit report listed only 
one outstanding balance on a debt originally held by the bank, of $1,222 under account 4149, which is likely the 
account number assigned by the collection agency. As of June 28, 2010, another collection agency was 
handling the $1,222.40 debt balance under a client reference number 41492332.  (Ex. G.) 
 
4 Applicant responded affirmatively at her hearing when asked by Department Counsel whether she had the 
opportunity to work full-time before early July 2010 when her hours were apparently reduced to 16 to 24 hours 
per week. (Tr. 72.) Applicant provided financial records which show payroll deposits of $587.54 on September 
11, 2008, $743.31 on September 25, 2008, $652.75 on October 9, 2008, $808.49 on October 24, 2008, 
$554.93 on November 6, 2008, $714.33 on November 20, 2008, $621.89 on December 4, 2008, $817.95 on 
December 18, 2008, and $642.07 on December 31, 2008. So she was working full-time plus overtime when 
available as of September 2008.  
 
 7 
that she had lost her paperwork while moving about three months ago. Applicant admitted 
she had not made any efforts to repay the debt in SOR 1.e and was uncertain whether it 
was still an open collection account. Applicant expressed her intent to resolve the open 
collection accounts. Applicant acknowledged that she had a credit card account with the 
lender in SOR 1.b at one time, although she did not recall that it went past due. She did not 
recognize the lender identified in SOR 1.f. Applicant attributed her debts to her job layoff in 
June 2001, and low-paying jobs thereafter, which did not give her the income to pay even 
the monthly minimums on her credit card accounts. Her current bills were being paid 
according to her budget. She attributed the omission of the debts from her e-QIP to not 
having had the paperwork about the accounts when she filled out the form. (Ex. 4.) 
 
 With her pay $11.50 hourly and overtime at $17.25 hourly, Applicant‟s net pay was 
around $928.73 per week as of late September 2009. (Ex. 4.) Other obligations took priority 
over repaying her old debts. She and her family members incurred a $1,000 heating bill, 
and car expenses, including tires. (Tr. 73.) At DOHA‟s request, Applicant completed a 
personal financial statement in mid-October 2009. She listed monthly expenses and one 
debt payment of $40, which together exceeded her net income of $2,016 by about $674, but 
added that she was responsible for only a quarter of the household bills. Other family 
members (mother, sister, and son) contributed to the household. (Ex. 4.) In January 2010, a 
wireless telephone provider placed a $482 debt in collection because of no activity since 
November 2009. (Ex. 7.) Applicant testified that this cellular phone was opened for her 
niece. (Tr. 70.) Applicant made no payments on the debt and the balance reached $838 as 
of June 2010. (Ex. 7; Tr. 70.) As of June 2010, the student loan on which Applicant co-
signed for her niece was in deferment with a balance owed of $15,681.96. (Ex. D.) 
 
 As of July 2010, Applicant was paying at least half of the $1,200 rental fee for the 
apartment Applicant shared with her mother and her son. Applicant‟s son receives $560 in 
social security benefit each month and he and his grandmother each pay a quarter of the 
rent. (Tr. 63.) Because of a cut in overtime and in her own hours to between 16 and 24 
hours per week as of early July 2010, Applicant‟s net monthly income was $1,600, although 
she hoped to return to full-time hours. (Tr. 64-65.) She paid off a car loan in January 2010. 
(Tr. 66.) With her share of the expenses around $1,055 and credit card debt payments 
totaling $165 per month (Tr. 67.), she had around $380 per month that she was saving for 
emergencies.
5
 (Tr. 68.) Applicant last used a credit card for purchases in May 2009. (Tr. 69, 
85.) She has not received any credit counseling. (Tr. 70.) 
 
 Applicant testified at her hearing on July 21, 2010, that she did not know that her past 
due credit card accounts had gone to collections at the time that she completed her e-QIP. 
(Tr. 38.) She acknowledged knowing that she had fallen behind on some of her credit cards, 
but she was not sure of the creditors‟ names or their addresses, and could not find her 
financial records because she moved the day she completed the June 2009 e-QIP, so she 
responded negatively to the financial record questions. (Tr. 33, 38.) She claims to not recall 
when she opened her credit card accounts or when she stopped using them. (Tr. 43-44.) 
Applicant did not list her 1997 felony charge because it was dismissed and she did not know 
                                                 
5 
Apparently Applicant has other expenses that are not included in the $1,055, including her share of the $150 
monthly rental fee for a storage unit. 
 
 8 
that she had been charged with a felony. (Tr. 47-48.) In response to why she did not list her 
bankruptcy on her earlier security clearance application, the SF 86 completed in January 
2005, Applicant testified, “I didn‟t think it was relevant at the time.” (Tr. 50.) She had not 
disclosed any credit card debts on the SF 86 because she believed she had no debts at that 
time. (Tr. 51-52.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a „right‟ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant‟s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are 
not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge‟s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number 
of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, 
Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). 
 
Analysis

Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about finances is set out in AG ¶ 18, as follows:  
     
Failure or inability to live within one‟s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG ¶ 
19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant overextended herself on credit cards and filed for bankruptcy in May 1999. 
After her debts were discharged, she showed she could not handle credit responsibly in that 
she opened new credit card accounts to re-establish her credit but then did not remain 
current in her payments on four accounts. As of June 2009, when she applied for a security 
clearance for her present duties, she owed around $11,076 in delinquent debt. And 
although not alleged in the SOR, she cosigned on a cellular phone account for her niece 
that was placed for collection in January 2010 in the amount of $482. As of June 2010, the 
balance had increased to $838 due to nonpayment. AG ¶ 19(a) and ¶ 19(c) are established. 
 
  Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual‟s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot 
reasonably apply. Although her bankruptcy was filed in 1999, she stopped paying on newer 
credit card accounts in 2007. 
 
 Applicant attributes her financial problems to a job layoff in June 2001 and to low-
paying jobs thereafter. Applicant indicated to a Government investigator in July 2009 that 
after she was laid off, she did not earn enough to make the minimum payments on her 
credit cards. The uncontroverted evidence indicates that after she resigned from her full-
time employment in January 2006, she was employed only part-time on weekends, although 
as of February 2006 she expected her hours at work to increase. She was employed as a 
cashier for a wholesale club from April 2006 to February 2007 and then as a security 
guard/officer when she fell behind on her credit card accounts. Low income only partially 
mitigates the security concerns, however. She showed financially irresponsibility in her 
handling of the credit card accounts in the SOR and the wireless telephone debt that was 
not alleged. Applicant knew that the debts in SOR 1.a and 1.d (duplicated in SOR 1.c) had 
been referred for collections. In July 2009, she told a Government agent that the accounts 
had been placed for collection two or three years ago and that she had made payments 
 
 10 
when she could afford to. She also knew that her credit card account in SOR 1.e had fallen 
delinquent two or three years before. In her favor, Applicant contacted a debt consolidation 
company. But she elected not to pursue that option because she would have to pay the firm 
$300 a month for six months before any of her funds would be disbursed to her creditors. 
While Applicant certainly was not required to pursue debt consolidation to resolve her debts, 
AG ¶ 20(b) cannot fully apply where she failed to remain apprised of her debt situation and 
her debt payments were prompted by collection efforts. Although her hourly wage was only 
$11.50 to start with her present employer, she supplemented her wages by overtime work, 
and she shared living costs with other family members, including her son who has a social 
security benefit. Applicant was not sufficiently proactive in addressing her debts. Moreover, 
she showed poor financial judgment in allowing the wireless phone debt to go to collection 
in January 2010. Her hours at work were not reduced until late June 2010. 
 
 Applicant‟s payments toward three of her four delinquent debts are viewed favorably 
despite their recency. However, it is difficult to apply AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a 
good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” Payments toward 
her debts were largely prompted by collection efforts. Although her credit reports show 
significant progress toward resolving the debt in SOR 1.d (duplicated in SOR 1.c), the 
balance of SOR 1.a has been reduced by only $85.99, despite her claim of $75 monthly 
payments since December 2009. Furthermore, she has yet to make any payments on the 
debt in SOR 1.e, and the wireless phone debt (not alleged) has increased to $838 due to 
nonpayment. Full satisfaction of her delinquent debt is not required for access, but a longer 
track record of debt repayment is required before I can confidently conclude that her 
financial problems are safely behind her. She still owes around $8,054 in delinquent credit 
card debt, at least $838 in wireless telephone debt, and has not had any credit counseling. 
Should her niece default on her student loan, Applicant will become responsible for repaying 
that debt as well. AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control,” is not yet established. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
 The security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about 
an individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid 
answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to 
cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
Applicant did not disclose her September 1997 felony arrest, her bankruptcy, or any 
delinquent debts on her January 2005 SF 86 or her June 2009 e-QIP. Applicant denies any 
intentional falsification. Accordingly the Government has the burden of establishing the 
applicability of AG ¶ 16(a): 
 
 
 11 
Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form 
used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, 
or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
A finding of intentional falsification can be inferred from omission of information that 
on its face should have been reported. Question 21 on the SF 86 and 22.c on the e-QIP are 
unambiguous in requiring the disclosure of any felony arrests regardless of the passage of 
time. Applicant denies knowing that she was charged with a felony offense, which the 
Government submits is not credible in light of her probation, required parenting classes, and 
loss of temporary custody of her son. There is nothing about Applicant‟s sentence that is 
imposed only in felony cases. Available court records show the case was handled in district 
court with no formal indictment, and the charges were dismissed in December 1999. The 
evidence falls short of proving that she knew she had been charged with a felony offense. 
As to whether the charges should have been reported in response to question 26 on the SF 
86 pertaining to any other offenses, she was charged outside the seven-year scope of the 
inquiry. I find no merit to the Government‟s assertion that Applicant should have known to 
list the offense because she was still on probation during the first year covered by question 
26. And clearly, the charges were not within the seven-year inquiry of question 22.b on her 
June 2009 e-QIP concerning any arrests. 
 
However, Applicant admitted at her hearing that she had not listed her 1999 
bankruptcy on her January 2005 SF 86 because she did not think it was relevant at the 
time. (Tr. 50.) Her response to 33, “In the last 7 years, have you filed a petition under any 
chapter of the bankruptcy code (to include Chapter 13)?” was knowingly false and 
implicates AG ¶ 16(a). But the evidence does not show that Applicant should have listed 
any of the debts in the SOR in response to questions 38 (debts over 180 days delinquent) 
or 39 (debts currently over 90 days). The debts alleged in the SOR were not shown to be 
delinquent as of her February 2005 SF 86. The credit bureaus were reporting that Applicant 
owed a balance of $25,101 for the repossessed vehicle, but no other delinquencies. (Ex. 6.) 
When Applicant was interviewed in February 2006, she indicated that the repossession 
occurred long before her bankruptcy and that debt may have been included on her 
bankruptcy. She also indicated that she had not heard from the creditor in more than a 
decade. The Government did not allege that Applicant knowingly withheld information about 
that debt from her SF 86. 
 
As of her June 2009 e-QIP, Applicant had stopped paying on the credit card 
accounts in SOR 1.a, 1.b (duplicated in 1.f), 1.d (duplicated in 1.c), and 1.e.  As shown by 
her admissions to the Government investigator in July 2009, she knew that the debts in 
SOR 1.a and 1.d were in collections (Ex. 4.), notwithstanding her recent testimony to the 
contrary. (Tr. 37.) And she also admitted that she had stopped paying on the credit card 
account in SOR 1.e, and had been contacted by the creditor around June 2008. Even 
assuming she had misplaced her paperwork during a move, it would not excuse her 
knowingly false responses to questions 26.g (bills for collection), 26.h (credit cards 
suspended, charged off, or cancelled), 26.m (180 days delinquent), and 26.n (currently over 
 
 12 
90 days delinquent) on her e-QIP. AG ¶ 16(a) is also implicated because of the conduct 
alleged in SOR 2.a through 2.c. 
  
None of the mitigating conditions are satisfied. No one reviewing either her January 
2005 SF 86 or her June 2009 e-QIP would know that she had financial problems. There is 
no indication that Applicant informed the Government of her bankruptcy before her interview 
of February 2006. AG ¶ 17(a), “the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the 
omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts,” does not 
mitigate her SF 86 falsification of question 33. Her admissions to the credit card 
delinquencies during a July 2009 interview constitute a prompt correction of her June 2009 
e-QIP falsifications, but it was not shown that she volunteered the information about her 
debts upfront before being confronted about her poor credit record. AG ¶ 17(c), “the offense 
is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot reasonably apply to the 
falsification of two security clearance applications.  
 
Applicant‟s efforts to justify her negative responses to the debt inquiries (the 1999 
bankruptcy was no longer relevant in January 2005 and she did not have the paperwork on 
her delinquent credit card accounts in June 2009)  preclude me from favorably considering 
AG ¶ 17(d), “the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to 
change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, 
or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such 
behavior is unlikely to recur.” She has yet to show sufficient reform of the personal conduct 
concerns raised by her false statements. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant‟s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and all 
relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual‟s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
Applicant incurred delinquent debt after she was afforded a financial fresh start 
through a Chapter 7 discharge in September 1999. The timely payments that she made on 
her credit obligations around 2005 weigh in her favor, but they were not sustained. Her 
mismanagement of credit continues to cast doubt about her financial judgment, especially in 
light of the wireless debt going to collection in January 2010 and her inability or 
unwillingness at her hearing to provide details about her delinquent credit card accounts. 
 
 13 
Applicant cannot fully demonstrate financial reform when she does not know or is unwilling 
to acknowledge what she owes or to whom. Her lack of candor about her financial problems 
when applying for security clearance shows an unacceptable tendency to act in self-interest 
and it calls into question her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Based on the 
evidence before me, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
 14 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   For Applicant (duplicate of 1.d) 
Subparagraph 1.d:   Against Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.e:   Against Applicant 
 Subparagraph 1.f:   For Applicant (duplicate of 1.b) 
 Subparagraph 1.g:   Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 2.a:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.b:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.c:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 2.d:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.e:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.f:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 2.g:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
