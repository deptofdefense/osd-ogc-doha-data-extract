DUFFY, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on May 7, 2009. On May 6, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under 
Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after 
September 1, 2006.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue Applicant’s security clearance. Applicant answered the SOR on June 4, 
2010, and later requested a hearing on March 11, 2011. The case was assigned to me 
on May 18, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 2, 2011. The hearing was 
held as scheduled on June 22, 2011. Department Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 
through 7 that were admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel’s list 
of exhibits was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant testified and offered 
exhibits (AE) A through M that were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant’s list of exhibits was marked as HE 2. The record was left open until July 5, 
2011, for Applicant to submit additional matters. Applicant’s Counsel timely submitted 
additional documents that he marked as AE M through U. Since there was already an 
AE M, the new documents were re-lettered as AE N through V and admitted into 
evidence without objection. On July 11, 2011, Applicant’s Counsel submitted another 
document that was marked as AE W and admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant’s list of supplement exhibits was marked as HE 3 and Department Counsel’s 
email indicating he had no objection to those documents was marked as HE 4. The 
transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on July 6, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had a Chapter 7 bankruptcy dismissed in 
September 2004 and that he had 13 delinquent debts totaling $155,133. In his Answer, 
Applicant admitted with comments the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.m and 
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.n, a collection account in the amount of $4,884. His 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.1 
 
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee who works for a defense contractor. He has 
worked for that contractor since April 2009. He is a high school graduate. He is 
divorced. The divorce proceeding was filed in September 2003 and granted in March 
2004. Since May 2005, he has resided with his ex-wife and two children, ages 12 and 
17. This is the first time that he has applied for a security clearance.2 
 
From 1997 to 2002, Applicant and his brother operated a telecommunications 
business as equal partners. At first, the business prospered and they hired employees. 
In about 2000, the business encountered a downturn and customers began delaying 
payments or defaulting on their accounts. Applicant and his brother struggled to meet 
their financial obligations. As the business declined, they did not layoff employees, but 
failed to pay employee payroll taxes. This resulted in a tax deficiency amounting to

$256,000, half of which was Applicant’s responsibly. The Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) filed tax liens against Applicant in August 2002 for $128,000 and in November 
2002 for $10,111. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that, although he and his brother 
did not pay the payroll taxes, they submitted the required reports to the IRS. The 
business closed in May 2002. Since then, Applicant started two other businesses that 
also failed. His last business failed in April 2009. These business failures resulted in him 
failing behind on a number of debts.3  
 
After the debts became delinquent, Applicant did not make any payments 
towards them or contact the creditors for a number of years. In October 2003, he filed a 
petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. This proceeding was later converted to a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.a) and was dismissed in September 2004. In May 2010, 
he paid or settled-in-full four of the alleged delinquent debts. In August 2010, he filed a 
petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection that resulted in a discharge of debts. The 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition reflected that Applicant had $15,919 in assets and 
$225,243 in liabilities, including his tax deficiencies. As part of that bankruptcy, he 
completed an approved credit counseling course in July 2010.4 
 
Each of the alleged SOR debts is addressed below. 
 
SOR 1.b – state tax lien of $344. At the hearing, Applicant indicated this tax lien 
was being paid by a wage garnishment until it was “satisfied” in the 2010 bankruptcy. In 
his post-hearing submission, he provided a Notice of Levy on Wages dated February 
11, 2010, that reflected his wages were garnished for two state tax deficiencies. The 
first tax deficiency (totaling $5,379) was for the tax period ending December 1999. The 
second (totaling $418) was for the tax period ending December 2002. He also provided 
pay stubs covering the period from February 22, 2010, to July 11, 2010, that revealed 
$2,189 was garnished from his pay. Upon the filing of the bankruptcy petition, the 
garnishment would have been subject to the bankruptcy code’s automatic stay 
provisions. It is not known, however, whether the state tax lien was discharged in the 
bankruptcy. As a general rule, state tax deficiencies are not discharged in bankruptcy, 
but there are exceptions. Applicant’s credit report obtained after the bankruptcy 
discharge indicated that a state tax lien of $2,714 was released, but did not indicate 
whether the state tax lien of $344 (SOR ¶ 1.b) was either discharged or released. 
Insufficient evidence has been presented to establish this tax lien has been resolved.5 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c – IRS tax lien of $128,000 and SOR ¶ 1.d – IRS tax lien of $10,111. 
Since incurring these federal tax liens in 2002, Applicant has not made any voluntary

4 Tr. 23, 26, 40-41, 45-47; GE 4, AE E, H, K, L, P, S, T, W. AE K indicated that the bankruptcy 
resulted in a discharge, but does not indicate the date of discharge.

523(a)(1) (Exceptions to discharge).

payments on them. However, his income tax refunds have been withheld and applied. 
In December 2010, the IRS issued a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien 
indicating that he satisfied the IRS tax lien of $10,111 (SOR ¶ 1.d). No evidence was 
presented as to exactly how this tax lien was satisfied. Applicant testified that he 
thought the tax deficiency in SOR ¶ 1.d was included in SOR ¶ 1.c. Since he made no 
voluntary payments on the tax deficiencies, the tax lien in SOR ¶1.d most likely was 
satisfied through the withholding of his income tax refunds. In April 2011, he contacted 
the IRS to try to resolve the tax deficiency in SOR ¶ 1.c. On June 8, 2011, the IRS 
accepted Applicant’s installment agreement offer to pay $200 per month on this 
remaining tax deficiency. Under this agreement, the first payment was due after the 
hearing on July 20, 2011. Thereafter, the payments are due on the 20th of each month 
until the full amount owed was paid. The letter from IRS indicated this agreement was 
tailored to Applicant’s current financial condition and indicated that it could be revised if 
his ability to pay changes. The IRS also encouraged him to pay more than the agreed 
amount because penalties and interest charges continue to accrue until the account is 
paid in full. SOR ¶ 1.d is resolved. Insufficient evidence has been presented to establish 
that SOR ¶ 1.c is resolved.6 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – collection for medical debt of $192. This debt was placed for 
collection in January 2008. Applicant paid this debt in May 2010.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – collection for television service debt of $469. This debt was placed 
for collection in April 2009 and was discharged in the 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g – collection for telephone service debt of $318. This debt was placed 
for collection in September 2005. In May 2010, Applicant reached a settlement 
agreement with the collection company and paid this debt.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h – collection for credit card debt of $630. The date of first 
delinquency/date of last activity for this debt was January 2006. This debt was 
discharged in the 2010 Chapter 7 bankruptcy.10 
 
                                                          
6 Tr. 24-28, 31, 36-39, 57-59; GE 1-7; AE G, K, M, V. As noted above, Applicant claimed that the 
IRS tax lien of $10,111 was part of the IRS tax lien of $128,000. However, GE 7 reflects that the tax lien 
for $10,111 was filed after the other lien. Consequently, these were separate liens.  
7 Tr. 28, 47, 62-63; GE 2, 7, AE F, K, S, W. In AE S, the medical office indicated the debt was 
paid in May 2010, while the collection agency in AE W indicated it was paid in May 2011. Given the 
intervening bankruptcy, the medical office document would appear to contain the more accurate date.

SOR ¶ 1.i – collection for jewelry store debt of $1556. The date of first 
delinquency/date of last activity for this debt was June 2005. In May 2010, Applicant 
settled this account with a payment of $305. The collection agency also issued him an 
IRS Form 1099-C reflecting that $627 of this debt was cancelled.11 
 
SOR ¶ 1.j – collection for telephone service debt of $318. This debt is a duplicate 
of SOR ¶ 1.g, above. It is resolved.12 
 
SOR ¶ 1.k – collection for telephone service debt of $634. The date of first 
delinquency/date of last activity for this debt was February 2005. Applicant reached a 
settlement agreement with the collection company and paid this debt in May 2010.13  
 
SOR ¶ 1.l – vehicle repossession of $6,825. The date of first delinquency/date of 
last activity for this debt was July 2003. This debt was discharged in the 2010 Chapter 7 
bankruptcy.14 
 
SOR ¶ 1.m – collection for school loan of $852. Applicant obtained a school loan 
for an online course in 2006. Soon after he started the course, he realized that it was 
not what he expected and terminated the course. He disputed this debt unsuccessfully. 
At the hearing, he claimed this debt was discharged in bankruptcy. However, student 
loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy unless that debt would impose an undue 
hardship on the debtor or his or her dependents. None of the exhibits reflect that this 
debt was discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding. Applicant’s post-bankruptcy credit 
report indicated that this student loan is still outstanding with a balance of $1,726, and 
that its payment status is “Current, was past due 120 days.” The payment history for this 
student loan indicated “ND” (no data) for the months of August through November 2010, 
and that $50 monthly payments were made from January to July 2010 as well as in 
December 2010 and January 2011. This student loan is being resolved.15 
 
SOR ¶ 1.n – collection for vehicle loan of $4,884. Applicant indicated that he 
voluntarily returned this vehicle to the creditor when he filed his 2003 bankruptcy. At the 
hearing, he claimed this debt was discharged in his 2010 bankruptcy. This vehicle loan, 
however, was not listed in his 2010 bankruptcy petition. At the hearing, he stated that all 
debts on his credit report were listed in his bankruptcy petition. This vehicle loan,

the SOR. However, based on an examination of the inception date, amount, and number of student loans, 
these appear to be the same student loan.

however, was not listed in his credit reports dated March 16, 2010, and March 10, 2011, 
presumably due to the passage of time. Through no good-faith efforts by Applicant to 
satisfy this debt, it is no longer an ongoing debt and is considered resolved.16 
 
On June 19, 2009, an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) interviewed Applicant about his financial issues. During that interview, he 
acknowledged many of his delinquent debts and indicated that he was meeting his 
current financial obligations. Before filing his second bankruptcy, Applicant hired a debt 
consolidation agency to assist him in resolving his delinquent debts. In June and July 
2010, he made payments to the debt consolidation agency. In responding to DOHA 
interrogatories, he submitted a personal financial statement dated December 9, 2009, 
that reflected he had a net monthly income of $2,750 and net monthly expenses of 
$1,850, monthly debt payments of $515, resulting in a net monthly remainder of $385. 17 
 
At the hearing, Applicant indicated that he was living with his ex-wife and sharing 
expenses with her. She is employed, but no evidence was presented about her income 
or exactly how they share expenses. His most recent credit report reflected that he has 
no open credit card accounts. In addition to his tax deficiencies (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c), 
this credit report reflects he has two accounts with outstanding balances, one is the 
student loan (SOR ¶ 1.m) and the other is a closed credit card account with a balance 
of $2,741. The closed credit card account, which was opened in August 2001, is listed 
as “current” with monthly payments of $41 having been made for the last two years and 
was not listed in either of his bankruptcy petitions, but was listed in his personal 
financial statement of December 2009.18 
 
Applicant’s federal income tax return for 2008 indicated that he had an adjusted 
gross income of $20,915 in 2008 and $18,580 in 2007. His latest bankruptcy petition 
indicated that his gross income from his businesses was $28,814 in 2009 and $18,434 
in 2010. The petition also indicated that he had an average monthly income of $2,047 
and average monthly expenses of $2,027, with a net monthly remainder of $20, and that 
he was laid off on June 26, 2010, and anticipated returning to work on August 9, 2010. 
At the hearing, he estimated he currently earned $45,000 per year.19 
 
Applicant is held is high regard by his peers at work. His supervisor and 
coworkers submitted letters of reference that describe him as excellent technician with 
high degree of integrity, ambition, and responsibility. They consider him to be honest 
and trustworthy. His performance appraisals from his current employer reflect that he

performs at the “above expected” level. One appraisal indicated that he “is a team 
player, a true professional, and an asset to the [company].”20 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavourable, to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v.

Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling 
to satisfy his financial obligations for a number of years. This evidence is sufficient to 
raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Several Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
9 
 
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of 
actions to resolve the issue. 
 
From 1997 to 2009, Applicant operated a number of businesses that failed. 
Specifically, from 1997 to 2002, he and his brother were equal partners in a business 
that failed. During a business downturn in about 2000, they decided not to layoff 
employees even though they were unable to pay the payroll taxes for those employees. 
This decision, while compassionate, was not prudent financially and resulted in a 
significant tax deficiency. In 2002, two federal tax liens totaling $138,111 were filed 
against him. In 2003 and 2004, he also went through a divorce proceeding. The 
business downturn, his divorce, and his short period of unemployment in 2010 were 
conditions beyond his control that contributed to his financial problems. However, his 
decision to keep employees on the job and not pay their payroll taxes was a matter 
within his control. To obtain full credit under AG ¶ 20(b), both prongs of that mitigating 
condition, i.e., conditions beyond the person’s control and responsible conduct, must be 
established. Applicant continued to start new businesses but took no action to resolve 
the tax liens for almost eight years. He also took a number of years to resolve other 
debts. Although he had limited income from 2007 to 2009, his failure to address the 
alleged debts for years weighs against a determination that he acted responsibly under 
the circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. 
 
Many of Applicant’s delinquent debts have been resolved recently. In May 2010, 
he settled or paid the delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.k. As part of his 
bankruptcy requirements, he received financial counseling in July 2010. The debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, and 1.l were discharged in his 2010 bankruptcy. In December 2010, 
the IRS indicated that he satisfied the tax deficiency in SOR ¶1.d and released him from 
that lien. This was most likely satisfied through an involuntary tax refund withholding. 
The delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.n apparently fell off his credit reports due to the 
passage of time and, therefore, was not included in his bankruptcy petition. Additionally, 
 
10 
 
 
although he thought the student loan in SOR ¶ 1.m was discharged in bankruptcy, this 
debt is still listed on his post-bankruptcy credit report as outstanding and in a “current” 
status. AG ¶ 20(d) applies to SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, and 1.m. AG ¶ 20(c) applies 
to SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n.  
 
Two of Applicant’s alleged debts remain unresolved. One of these is minor (SOR 
¶ 1.b is for $344) and the other is major (SOR ¶ 1.c is for $128,000). Of note, the 
Appeal Board has stated,  
 
As a general rule, an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to 
develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. All 
that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his 
circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a 
serious intent to effectuate the plan. Depending on the facts of a given 
case, the fact that an applicant’s debts will not be paid off for a long time, 
in and of itself, may be of limited security concern.21  
 
In 2002, Applicant incurred the $128,000 tax lien. He neglected to take action on it until 
he contacted the IRS in April 2011. Two weeks before the hearing, he entered into an 
installment agreement with the IRS for that tax deficiency. Under that agreement, he is 
required to make monthly payments of $200 until the full amount owed is paid. Applicant 
had not made any voluntary payments on that tax deficiency. Of concern is his ability to 
make the agreed monthly payments. His 2010 bankruptcy petition provided the most 
recent information about his current financial situation. As noted in that petition, he had 
$20 of disposable income per month that he could apply towards the tax deficiency. 
Based on the record evidence, he failed to show that he is able to make the required 
monthly payments. Furthermore, his eight-year delay in attempting to resolve this tax 
deficiency casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
These last-minute efforts fail to mitigate the security concerns that arise from the 
remaining federal tax lien. Given the doubtful nature of his current plan for resolving this 
tax lien and his lengthy period of inaction in addressing it, I cannot find that he acted 
“responsibly given his circumstances and develop[ed] a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by ‘concomitant conduct,’ that is, actions which evidence a serious intent 
to effectuate the plan.” Applicant knew in 2002 that he had tax liens yet he continued to 
open businesses and incurred additional delinquent debts, including two repossessed 
vehicles, and never contacted the IRS to address the tax liens. His only payment 
towards his tax liens were involuntary tax refund withholdings. I find he has failed to 
establish a meaningful track record for addressing this significant tax deficiency. AG ¶ 
20(a) does not apply. SOR ¶ 1.c remains a security concern.

 Applicant established that the delinquent debt in SOR ¶ 1.j was a duplicate of the 
one in SOR ¶ 1.g. AG ¶ 20(e) applies to SOR ¶ 1.j. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be 
an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines 
and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c).  
The comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the 
whole-person concept analysis. I have considered Applicant’s service to his employer. 
He performs at the “above expected” level. His supervisor and coworkers hold him in 
high esteem and consider him trustworthy. Nevertheless, he accumulated a number of 
delinquent debts over a ten-year period that he began to resolve only after initiation of 
the security clearance process. Applicant and his brother consciously chose not to pay 
the mandated payroll taxes for their employees. He neglected this tax lien for eight 
years. He eventually resolved one tax lien through tax refund withholdings. Three of his 
delinquent debts were discharged in bankruptcy, while another apparently fell off of his 
credit report. Applicant has a poor history of financial responsibility. It is simply too soon 
to determine whether his financial problems are behind him. He has failed to establish a 
meaningful track record of addressing his significant tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.c. After 
weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and 
circumstances, in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude he has not 
mitigated security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  
 
I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and 
supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative 
process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. 
Applicant has not fully mitigated or overcome the Government’s case. For the reasons 
stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.

Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
