Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a
security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows he has a history
of financial problems or difficulties. Although he has made honest efforts to address his
multiple delinquent debts, he is still facing about $30,000 in delinquent debt that he is
unlikely to resolve anytime soon. At present, it is simply too soon to tell if Applicant’s
problematic financial history is a thing of the past or a harbinger of things to come.
Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   
 Exhibit 1. 2

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on February 4,1
2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and
it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations.
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to me April 28, 2011. The hearing took place June 8, 2011. The transcript (Tr.) was
received June 21, 2011. 
The record was kept open until June 29, 2011, to allow Applicant to submit
additional documentary evidence. He made a timely submission, and those matters are
marked and admitted without objections as Exhibit Q.  
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged 16 delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $77 to $16,129
for a total of about $88,000. In Applicant’s two-page reply the SOR, he admitted ten
debts and denied six debts. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. In addition,
the following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. 
Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has never
married and has no children. He currently lives with his mother and pays her about $500
monthly for rent. His educational background includes a bachelor’s degree awarded in
May 2003. He attended a relatively small, private college, and he paid for it by obtaining
a student loan for each semester or every year for the four years he attended. He began
his current employment as an interactive multimedia instructional specialist in February
2010. He is paid on a salary basis; for 2010 his annual salary was $52,000; for 2011 his
annual salary is $53,300. He is seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance for this
job.  
Applicant has had an unstable employment history since finishing college in
2003.  He initially worked, on a commission basis, as a director of marketing for a small2
firm.  He left that job in August 2003, when he was not being paid and felt he needed a

job that paid on a regular basis to meet his financial obligations. He worked as a
customer care assistant from August 2003 to September 2005. He left that job for a
better opportunity and relocated to his current domicile. He worked as a help-desk
technical supervisor from September 2005 to April 2009, when he was laid off after his
job was outsourced to Mexico. Thereafter, he had a couple of temporary jobs, but he
was essentially unemployed from April 2009 until he began his current job in February
2010, a period of about ten months. He received unemployment compensation or
benefits during that period.  
Applicant has denied six debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.p, for
$1,360, $915, 2,695, $752, and $500, respectively, because he disputes that they are
his debts. In furtherance of his disputes, he filed a police report in 2008 for the
fraudulent use of his identity.  The police report lists six accounts, to include the five3
debts at issue here, along with the amounts that match those here. He also sent letters
to four of the five creditors disputing the debts.  The sixth debt he disputes, SOR ¶ 1.f4
for $2,845, stems from an apartment he once rented.  He contends that he owes a5
lesser amount (about $680 plus late fees of $180). He has not paid, settled, or
otherwise resolved that particular debt. 
Concerning the ten debts Applicant admits owing, SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.j, and 1.k
address three delinquent student loans in amounts of $15,965, $13,893, and $16,129,
respectively. He consolidated his multiple students loans into one loan with the same
lender. In his post-hearing submission, he presented paperwork, dated June 23, 2011,
from the lender showing that he owes a total of $66,682 for seven loans consolidated
into this account.  The total includes $66,442 in principal; the last payment of $215 was6
made in May 2011; no payment is due at this time because the account is in
forbearance from March 5, 2011, until August 5, 2011. 
Of the remaining seven debts, which he admits, Applicant has paid or settled
three for a total of about $1,318. Four debts remain unresolved for a total of about
$26,869. These seven debts are discussed below.  
 The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a is for an unpaid judgment for $779 owed to an apartment
complex. It was settled in full for $900 in February 2011.  7

The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $5,494 charged-off account. Applicant explained
this debt stems from an credit card account he openly jointly with his mother when he
was 17 years old, and they are working to pay it off.  It remains unresolved. 8
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is for a $10,753 charged-off account.  It stems from an9
auto loan in which the car was repossessed in 2008 after Applicant defaulted on the
loan. In his post-hearing submission, he presented paperwork from the creditor showing
a total deficiency owed of $6,021 as of January 2009.  It remains unresolved.10
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g is for a $891 collection account.  It stems from an11
apartment he once rented. At hearing, there was some confusion about documentation
related to the debt, but it appears that Applicant attempted to settle it for $657 in
February 2011.  It remains unresolved. 12
The two debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h for $77 and 1.i for $520 are both collection
accounts relating to the same overdrawn checking account.  The debts were settled or13
satisfied in March 2011 for $54 and $364, respectively.14
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.o is for a $14,463 collection account.  The debt stems from15
an auto loan for a vehicle involved in an accident. The accident resulted in a total loss
and then the insurance company denied coverage. Applicant admits that he owes
something on the debt, but disputes the amount owed. It remains unresolved. 
In addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant presented documentary evidence
concerning his current financial obligations on auto loans.  He is continuing to make his16
monthly loan payment for a 2004 Jeep while that vehicle is pending expensive repairs.
In the meantime, he purchased a 2011 Jeep for about $23,500, and he is making $500
monthly loan payments for that vehicle.17

Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As18
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt19
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An20
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  21
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting22
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An23
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate24
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme25
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.26

 Executive Order 10865, § 7.28
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 29
 See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an30
applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness
or recurring financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  31

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.27
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it28
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant29
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline30
F is:
 Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  31
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. This raises security concerns because it indicates inability or

 AG ¶ 19(c). 33
7
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within32 33
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions. 
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:  
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
I have considered all the mitigating conditions, and none, individually or in
combination, are sufficient to overcome and mitigate the security concerns. Applicant’s
problematic financial history is due to a burdensome student loan debt as well as
periods of underemployment and unemployment. At present, his financial situation is
not as bleak as the SOR suggests. As established in the findings of fact, he has
resolved 11 of the 16 debts. He has a reasonable basis to dispute five debts on the
basis of identity fraud. The three student loans debts are now consolidated into one loan
with one lender, and that account was in forbearance when the record closed. Likewise,
of the debts admitted, he has paid or settled three for a total of about $1,318. Applicant
is entitled to mitigation on all these matters. 
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9). 34

Nevertheless, he is still in a difficult financial position. As established in the
findings of fact, 5 of the 16 debts remain unresolved. He is disputing the debt in SOR ¶
1.f for $2,845, which stems from an apartment he once rented. He did not present any
documentary evidence in support of this dispute, and it remains unresolved. Likewise, of
the debts he admitted, four remain unresolved for a total of about $26,869. Taken
together, the evidence shows that his financial problems are ongoing because he still
owes nearly $30,000 in delinquent debt. He does not have a realistic plan in place to
address these debts, and it is fair to conclude that he will not resolve them anytime
soon. His financial problems are likely to become more difficult in August 2011, when
the forbearance period ends on his consolidated student loan account with a balance of
more than $60,000. And he did not improve his financial situation by incurring a $500
monthly loan payment to purchase a 2011 Jeep. At present, it is simply too soon to tell if
Applicant’s problematic financial history is a thing of the past or a harbinger of things to
come. 
 
To conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,
extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due
consideration to the nine factors of the whole-person concept.  Accordingly, I conclude34
that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable
clearance decision.

interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
