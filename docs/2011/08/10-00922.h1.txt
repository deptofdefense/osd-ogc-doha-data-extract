Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
he has a history of financial problems or difficulties (multiple delinquent debts). His
indebtedness is largely unresolved. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to
rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from his history of
financial problems. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against
Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on March 9, 2011,1
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and
it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations.   
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to me April 28, 2011. The hearing took place June 7, 2011. The transcript (Tr.) was
received June 16, 2011. 
The record was kept open until June 21, 2011, to provide Applicant an
opportunity to submit documentary information in support of his case, as he provided
none at the hearing. Applicant made two submissions, the first was timely and the
second was untimely. Nevertheless, without objections, all post-hearing matters are
marked and admitted as follows: Exhibit A–credit report, dated June 1, 2011, with
highlights (this is a copy of Exhibit 7); Exhibit B–correspondence related to the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.a; Exhibit C–correspondence related to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b; Exhibit
D–correspondence related to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c; Exhibit E–correspondence related
to the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e; Exhibit F–correspondence related to the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.f; Exhibit G–correspondence related to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g; Exhibit
H–correspondence related to the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h; Exhibit I–correspondence
unrelated to any debt in the SOR; and Exhibit J–correspondence related to the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.a. 
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged eight delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $51 to $8,757
for a total of about $17,871. Applicant’s answers to the SOR allegations were mixed.
His admissions to three debts are accepted as findings of fact. In addition, the following
findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.  
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. His educational
background includes some college and military education. He is employed as a logistics
analyst for a large company engaged in defense contracting. He is seeking to obtain an
industrial security clearance in conjunction with his employment.

Applicant’s employment history includes military service in the U.S. Army.  He2
served on active duty in the Army during 1983–1992. He worked as a supply specialist.
His military service includes deployment to Southwest Asia for the 1990–1991 Persian
Gulf War. 
Applicant is married, and he and his wife have two children, ages 19 and 20, for
whom they provide financial support. His wife is a recently retired military
servicemember (pay grade E-7). He has had multiple moves and multiple jobs over the
years due to her military assignments. For example, his security clearance application
reports eight different jobs from 1999 to present. They have lived in the same city since
2006, and it appears they intend to make this location their home. His wife is employed
as a federal civilian employee on a military installation. Altogether, Applicant and his
wife earn an annual gross income of approximately $100,000 to $150,000.  It consists3
of Applicant’s annual salary of about $65,000, with the balance consisting of his wife’s
annual salary, her military retired pay, and her disability compensation from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).   
Applicant has a history of delinquent debts. That history is established by credit
reports and information provided by him.  The current status of debts, as alleged in the4
SOR, is discussed below.
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.a is for a $2,921 collection account. It stems from an
apartment lease entered into by Applicant’s spouse when she initially moved to the city
in which they now reside. Applicant has disputed this debt due to dissatisfaction with the
apartment, which, in turn, led them to vacate the apartment before the lease expired.5
He formally disputed the debt with a credit reporting agency, and the result was that the
debt was confirmed with a balance due of $599.  This debt is unresolved. 6
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $377 charged-off account. The debt is now paid in
full.   7
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is for a $402 collection account. The debt is now settled in
full.  8

The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d is for a $716 collection account. It appears to involve the
same creditor as the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e; the last four digits of the account number are
7946. The 2008 credit report reflects this was a revolving account (a credit card
account) that was closed by the credit grantor and resulted in a charge off of $1,489 in
June 2004.  The 2009 credit report reflects a zero balance and notes that the account9
was sold to another creditor.  This debt does not appear in the 2011 credit reports.  At10 11
hearing, Applicant did not recall this acocunt.12
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e is for a $2,106 collection account. It appears to involve the
same creditor as the debt discussed above; the last four digits of the account number
are 6023. Both the 2008 and 2009 credit reports reflect that this was a credit card
account that was closed by the credit grantor and resulted in a charge off. This debt
does not appear in the 2011 credit reports. At hearing, Applicant did not recall this
account.
In his post-hearing submission, Applicant presented a letter from the credit card
company involved in debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e.  The letter provides that they13
investigated a fraud claim as reported by Applicant and determined it to be valid. The
letter was in reference to an account ending in the last four digits of 7149, which do not
match the two debts above, and they remain unresolved. 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.f is for a collection account for $8,757. At hearing, Applicant
stated that debt was being paid and the balance was about $5,000.  In his post-heairng14
submission, he presented a letter from a collection agency showing a debt was settled
in full in April 2010.  A review of the credit reports reveals that the creditor’s letter of15
settlement related to another collection account for $1,158 with the same creditor;  the16
last four digits of the account number are 5539. The $8,757 debt is unresolved. 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.g is for a $51 collection account. Applicant’s attempts to
track down this minor debt were unsuccessful.  This debt is unresolved. 17

The debt is SOR ¶ 1.h is for a $2,541 collection account. This debt is now settled
in full.18
In summary, concerning the eight delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant
has paid or settled three debts for about $3,320 in total. Five debts are unresolved for a
total of about $13,000.  
In addition to the matters in the SOR, Applicant has owed back taxes to the
IRS.  As of August 2010, Applicant completed an installment agreement to repay back19
taxes for tax years 2003 and 2006 for a total of about $2,356. He also indicated that he
may owe $4,000 in back taxes for tax year 2010, but the matter was pending. 
Concerning financial assets, Applicant testified that both he and his wife had
unknown, but likely small, amounts of money in 401(k) accounts.  He also testified that20
they had a “couple thousand” in a bank account, but otherwise have no financial
assets.21
Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As22
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt23
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.

 Executive Order 10865, § 7.32
6
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An24
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  25
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting26
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An27
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate28
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme29
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.30
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.31
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it32
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.

 See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an34
applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness
or recurring financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted).

Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant33
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline34
F is:
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  35
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties, and these matters are ongoing. This raises security concerns
because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not36
meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient37
to establish these two disqualifying conditions. 
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:  
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).38
8
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
I have considered all the mitigating conditions in light of the evidence as a whole, and
none, individually or in combination, is sufficient to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
the security concerns stemming from Applicant’s history of financial problems or
difficulties. 
Applicant has had full-time employment dating back to at least 1999. He has had
multiple jobs, which may have inhibited his ability to increase his salary, but recently he
has been making a good salary working for a defense contractor. His wife is gainfully
employed and her income is supplemented by her military retired pay and VA disability
compensation. Although they are now earning more than $100,000 annually, they have
little in way of financial assets. This is relevant concerning Applicant’s ability to repay
the delinquent debts. Moreover, his delinquent debts are largely unresolved as
established  in the findings of fact. During the hearing, Applicant came across as lacking
in command or knowledge of his finances, which does not inspire confidence, and it
suggests a degree of unwillingness to repay. What is missing here is responsible
conduct coupled with a good-faith effort during the recent past to repay or otherwise
resolve his delinquent debts. His good intentions and honorable military service are
insufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by his ongoing financial problems.  
To conclude, the evidence as a whole justifies current doubts about Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent
standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this
conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s38
favorable evidence, to include his honorable military service. Nevertheless, Applicant
did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
This case is decided against Applicant.

Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.h: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
