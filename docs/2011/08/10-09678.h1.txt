Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns caused by his long-term abuse of
a variety of controlled substances. Clearance is denied. 
On March 28, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline H (drug involvement). Applicant
submitted an undated response to the SOR that was executed by him on April 14, 2011.
He admitted all SOR allegations and requested a decision based on the record without a
hearing.
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 31, 2011,
which was mailed to Applicant on June 3, 2011. Applicant was notified he had 30 days
from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections thereto or any additional information he

wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on June 13, 2011.  He
did not submit a response to the FORM or object to anything contained in the FORM within
the time allowed. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on August 10,
2011, and reassigned to me on August 25, 2011, due to caseload considerations.
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 25-year-old single man who has been employed as a technical
apprentice by a defense contractor since November 2009. He graduated from high school
in May 2005, and he obtained a bachelor’s degree in May 2009. He worked at a variety of
jobs during summers and while attending college.  
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-
QIP) on January 4, 2010, in which he candidly admitted an extensive history of abusing
drugs. Specifically, he admitted occasionally purchasing, transferring, and selling marijuana
from December 2003 until August 2009. He admitted smoking marijuana three to fives time
a week during that period. He also admitted that he purchased and ate ecstasy pills twice,
purchased and snorted cocaine less than ten times, and purchased and ate hallucinogenic
mushrooms twice between September 2004 and August 2005. 
Applicant was questioned by an investigator from the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM) on April 29, 2010. During the interview, he asserted that he stopped
using marijuana from February 2004 until June 2004 to maintain high grades in school, and
from March 2009 until June 2009 because he was beginning his professional career. He
also claimed he stopped using marijuana completely in August 2009 because he had
outgrown it. He could not say how many times he sold marijuana between December 2003
and August 2009, only that he charged about $30 for 1.7 grams each time he sold
marijuana.
Applicant told the investigator he used cocaine on seven occasions at house parties.
He would snort one or two lines of cocaine each time he used it. He also told the
investigator he used hallucinogenic mushrooms and ecstacy twice each when he attended
a concert in June 2005. He also admitted to the investigator that he used marijuana while
vacationing in a foreign country in November 2005 and again in November 2006. 
In response to interrogatories he executed on February 9, 2011, Applicant wrote that
he consumes one beer daily, one glass of wine per month, and two ounces of liquor per
month. Applicant told the OPM investigator that he drank to intoxication about five times
annually. However, in his response to the interrogatories, Applicant averred that he no
longer drinks to intoxication. He also stated that on two occasions since April 2010 he
visited friends with whom he used to use marijuana, and that on each visit he observed
them smoking marijuana. He does not think he will be likely to see them twice a year in the
future. He wrote that he no longer abuses controlled substance and does not intend to do
so in the future.

Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and
mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Clearance decisions must be fair and
impartial decisions based upon relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-
person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although
the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not
outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case
can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,
Guideline H (drug involvement), with its disqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most
relevant in this case. 
  The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of5
the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant6
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.    11

Analysis
Guideline H, Drug Involvement
Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an
individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and
because it raises questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws,
rules, and regulations. AG ¶ 24
Applicant reported his extensive abuse of marijuana from December 2003 until
August 2009, including an unspecified number of sales. He also reported that he abused
cocaine on seven occasions from September 2004 to August 2005, and hallucinogenic
mushrooms and ecstasy when he attended a concert in June 2005. Disqualifying
Conditions (DC) 25(a): any drug abuse; and DC 25(c): illegal drug possession, including
cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of drug
paraphernalia apply.
Applicant’s last reported abuse of a controlled substance was in August 2009, and
he avers he has no intention of abusing any controlled substance in the future. However,
while two years have passed since Applicant’s last reported use of marijuana, he
associated with friends who were smoking marijuana and with whom he had previously
abused marijuana on at least two occasions since April 2010. He did not deny that he may
associate with those friends in the future, only that he probably will not be with his those
friends twice a year in the future.
This decision is based on the record without a hearing. Applicant failed to submit
any material in response to the FORM. He admitted all SOR allegations without
explanation or elaboration. Accordingly, there is scant record evidence on which to judge
the sincerity or probability of his assertion that he will not abuse controlled substances in
the future. Further, Applicant’s continued association with friends who are smoking
marijuana in his presence severely diminishes whatever reliance might otherwise be placed
on his renunciation of future drug abuse. 
Based on the above, I find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) 26(a): the behavior
happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it
is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability,
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 26(b): a demonstrated intent not to abuse any
drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate
period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of
clearance for any violation do not apply. The remaining mitigating conditions have no
application to the facts of this case. 
 
I have considered all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this
case, the whole-person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the
Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions. Applicant failed to
mitigate the security concerns caused by his long-term abuse of controlled substances. He
5
failed to overcome the case against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is
not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-e: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
