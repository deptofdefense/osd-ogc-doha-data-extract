GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 17, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He 
responded to the interrogatories on October 22, 2009.2 On another unspecified date, 
DOHA issued him another set of interrogatories. He responded to the interrogatories on 
October 22, 2009.3 On March 15, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated November 17, 2009. 
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated October 22, 2009).  
 
3 Government Exhibit 3 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated October 22, 2009).

to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) for all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged 
security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and detailed reasons 
why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on April 5, 2010. In a sworn statement, dated April 
12, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. At some unspecified point, Applicant 
changed his mind, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel was prepared to proceed on January 13, 2011, and the case was assigned to 
another administrative judge on February 1, 2011. Based on Applicant’s unavailability, a 
hearing could not be scheduled, and the case was reassigned to me on April 18, 2011. 
A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 23, 2011, and I convened the hearing, as 
scheduled, on July 14, 2011. 
 
 During the hearing, 6 Government exhibits (GE 1-6) and 26 Applicant exhibits 
(AE A-Z) were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The hearing 
transcript (Tr.) was received on July 25, 2011. The record was kept open until July 29, 
2011, to enable Applicant to supplement it, but no further submissions were received.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant both admitted and denied portions of four of 
the factual allegations (¶¶ 1.b. through 1.e.) of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. He denied the remaining factual allegation (¶ 
1.a.) of the SOR. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, 
and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old sole owner-employee of a defense contractor, currently 
serving as its president.4 He is seeking to retain a security clearance that was initially 
granted to him in 1993.5 A 1989 high school graduate, Applicant has a 1995 bachelor’s 
degree in engineering.6 While in high school, Applicant worked part-time in the family 
business.7 Since graduating from college, Applicant has held several different positions

with various employers. He was a computer salesman from September or October 1995 
until March or April 1996;8 a technology specialist from May 1999 until September 
2000,9 when he was laid off for a period of one month;10 and a technology consultant 
from October 2000 until September 2001.11 He established his company in October 
2001.12 Applicant has never served with the U.S. military.13 He has never been 
married.14 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant contends that between 2000 and 2008, he had excellent or exceptional 
credit.15 In reality, in June 2007, a credit analysis conducted by the three major credit 
reporting companies revealed his creditworthiness to be between fair and good 
(according to Equifax), good (according to Experian), and between good and very good 
(according to TransUnion).16 By April 2008, his creditworthiness with Equifax had 
improved with his FICO score increasing from 710 to 764.17  
 
Applicant owns three real estate properties. In 2000, Applicant used his first 
property (property A) as his primary residence.18 He purchased a beach property 
(property B) as a second home in 2003 or 2004. In 2008, in anticipation of getting 
married, Applicant purchased another property (property C) intended to serve as his 
new primary residence.19 At that time, property B had been on the market for two years, 
but due to real estate market conditions, his efforts to sell the property were not 
successful.20 At an unspecified time in 2008, Applicant’s marriage plans fell through.21 
At about the same time, he contends the market crashed and his income dropped.22

The SOR identified five purportedly continuing delinquencies, including one 
mortgage in a past-due status, as reflected by two credit reports from 2009,23 and one 
credit report from 2010,24 totaling approximately $466,444, of which $50,444 is past 
due. Some accounts reflected in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, 
or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced 
repeatedly, in many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same 
creditor name or under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by 
complete account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in 
some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. The 
information reflected in the credit reports is not necessarily accurate or up to date.  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): Unable to handle property C’s $3,700 monthly mortgage payment 
without his former fiancée’s financial contribution, in October 2008, Applicant applied for 
a mortgage modification.25 In his request, he offered as justification, his loss of income, 
increased expenses, and medical bills, along with the depressed housing market 
conditions and dramatically falling sales prices.26 A loan modification was approved, but 
there was no substantial difference in the payments, and it did not improve his particular 
conditions,27 so Applicant considered it a denial.28 The mortgage remained current until 
January 2009, but at about that time he started falling behind on his payments. He 
stopped making mortgage payments in January or February 2009.29 As of May 2009, 
with a mortgage balance of $416,219, Applicant was over 120 days past due with his 
mortgage payments, in the amount of $10,701.30 By September 2010, the past-due 
balance had risen to $53,000.31 Applicant currently resides in the residence,32 but has 
not paid any mortgage payments “based on [his] hope and desire to get a loan 
modification through the bank that unfortunately wasn’t realized. . . .”33 At the time of the 
hearing, property C had been on the market, but there have been no offers.34 Other

than his “unsuccessful” 2008 attempt to obtain a satisfactory loan modification, 
Applicant has made no effort to enter into payment arrangements regarding his 
delinquent mortgage payments or make ongoing monthly mortgage payments. He 
indicated that he will probably relinquish the property to the mortgage lender “just to 
move forward.”35 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): When Applicant purchased property C he had an internet provider 
install service at the house. During the installation process, the technician ruptured a 
water main pipe causing an extensive water spill.36 Applicant initially claimed that, as a 
settlement for the damage caused, the internet provider offered him six months of free 
premium service, which he accepted.37 He subsequently revised the length of the offer 
to have been only four months.38 Nevertheless, after six months, Applicant received a 
bill of over $400 for services for two months which he challenged.39 In March 2009, the 
account was placed for collection with an outstanding balance of $419.40 The account 
was still unresolved as of September 2010.41 Applicant claims he disputed the account 
with TransUnion, a credit reporting agency,42 and that based on an investigation by 
TransUnion, the account was deleted from the credit file.43 There is evidence that 
Applicant disputed the account, erroneously claiming the account was “never delinquent 
or in collections,”44 but there is no evidence that the credit reporting agency had deleted 
it. Applicant also contends the account with the creditor is current, with no outstanding 
balance.45 In fact, as of May 5, 2011, the account was $100 past due.46  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): Applicant purchased a refrigerator, washer, and dryer from a large 
retail store for property C.47 Applicant contends the technician installed the icemaker 
improperly and it spilled water throughout the home, causing water damage.48 Applicant

subsequently complained to the retail store and requested reimbursement for the 
damage, but negotiations were unsuccessful. He complained that the refrigerator was 
faulty, and he refused to pay the $2,797 for the appliances, contending he paid for the 
repairs and was therefore unable to make payments towards the original purchase.49 
He asked that the refrigerator be taken back to the retail store,50 but there is no 
evidence that it ever was returned. In April 2009, the account was transferred to a 
collection agent, and the unpaid balance was increased to $2,824.51 By October 2009, 
the balance had increased to $2,921.52 In January 2011, Applicant hired a law firm to 
address this and other accounts. However, he was unhappy with their inability to settle 
this and other accounts,53 so in July 2011, two weeks before the hearing, Applicant 
engaged the professional services of another attorney to negotiate a settlement,54 but 
as of the hearing, Applicant had not paid any portion of the outstanding account.55  
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): Applicant had a credit card account with a large national bank. In 
December 2008, the creditor issued its final notice to him, indicating the delinquent 
account would be written off as a bad debt and placed for collection.56 Applicant initially 
claimed he received a bill in about January 2009 reflecting an unpaid balance of 
$14,000.57 He subsequently revised the figure upward to $16,000.58 He said he called 
the creditor to dispute the amount which he felt was inflated from what he believed to be 
the true balance of about $3,000.59 He contended the creditor verbally agreed to settle 
the account for $3,000, because the other charges were not his.60 However, while 
Applicant was in the “process of obtaining the $3,000,” the creditor sold the account to a 
collection agent.61 In May 2009, the outstanding balance was $15,625.62 By September 
2010, the balance had increased to $17,000.63 Applicant engaged the professional

services of two different attorneys to negotiate a settlement,64 but as of the hearing, 
Applicant had not paid any portion of the outstanding account.65 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): When Applicant purchased property C, he also purchased tile 
flooring and hired a contractor to install it in his residence. He was unhappy with what 
he characterized as “shoddy workmanship.” The entire cost for the project was about 
$20,000.66 Applicant initially claimed the contractor had done a poor job and had 
damaged his granite counters,67 but the allegation pertaining to the counters was not 
repeated. He contends he paid the contractor two-thirds of the agreed amount, but that 
they walked off the job and never returned.68 The project remained unfinished.69 
Applicant refused to pay the remaining balance, which he estimated to be $2,500, until 
the project is completed.70 The creditor charged off the $6,949 balance in May 2009.71 
By October 2009, the balance had increased to $8,000.72 Applicant engaged the 
professional services of two different attorneys to negotiate a settlement,73 but as of the 
hearing, Applicant had not paid any portion of the outstanding account.74 
 
(Not Alleged): As noted above, from 2000 until 2008, Applicant used property A 
as his primary residence. In May 2009, Applicant’s mortgage was current.75 By 
September 2009, monthly mortgage payments had fallen behind, and the foreclosure 
process had commenced.76 Applicant made his last mortgage payment in February 
2010.77 In June 2010, Applicant inquired of his mortgage lender about a possible 
mortgage modification. The mortgage lender responded offering a variety of options.78

Applicant applied for the loan modification, but it was rejected by the mortgage lender 
without offering Applicant a trial period.79 When his tenants were unable to continue 
paying their rent in late 2010, Applicant obtained a writ of possession and had them 
evicted.80 In January 2011, Applicant hired a law firm to represent him in the pending 
foreclosure action.81 As of July 2011, a tenant was paying Applicant a monthly rent of 
$1,000.82 The property has been on the market since October 2010,83 and he has 
received at least three short sale contract offers,84 but there is no evidence that a final 
agreement has yet been approved. 
 
(Not Alleged): Applicant has owned property B since 2003 or 2004. It is rented 
for about $1,400 per month, but because the rent is less than the mortgage payment, 
Applicant stopped paying his monthly mortgage payments in March 2010.85 Applicant 
applied for a loan modification, but it was rejected by the mortgage lender without 
offering Applicant a trial period.86 The present status of the mortgage is not known. 
 
In October 2009, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a 
monthly income of $5,500, and monthly expenses of $5,110, including mortgage 
payments.87 He failed to estimate a monthly remainder, if any, available for 
discretionary spending.88 At that time, he reflected $12,000 in savings and $30,000 in 
stocks and bonds.89 In July 2011, Applicant estimated he had a monthly net income, 
including salary and rental income, of between $4,500 and $6,900.90 His estimated 
monthly expenses are approximately $2,000,91 leaving a monthly remainder of 
approximately $4,000 to $5,000, which is “being put away, as reflected in [his] bank

98 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.99  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”100 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”101 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially

overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until 2008 when, because of the downturn in the economy and the local 
housing market, and his diminished income, as well as his terminated marriage plans 
and associated additional discretionary expenses, Applicant’s income proved to be 
insufficient to handle his monthly expenses. He experienced disputes with vendors and 
contractors, and refused to pay some accounts because of continuing disputes. 
Applicant applied for mortgage modifications, all of which were either rejected or 
approved with terms Applicant did not like, and he intentionally stopped making the 
monthly payments on his three properties. Mortgages and other accounts became 
delinquent, and at least two of the three mortgages went into a foreclosure status. AG 
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
“the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.”102  
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until 2008. Applicant 
attributed his financial problems to three main causes: 1) his diminished income 
102 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

because of the downturn in the economy and the local housing market; 2) his 
terminated marriage plans and associated additional discretionary expenses of 
purchasing a new residence and making repairs to it to satisfy his fiancée; and 3) 
defective appliances and shoddy workmanship in the new residence. Although he 
denied it, claiming he had sufficient money to pay his bills, Applicant’s financial 
resources proved to be insufficient to handle his monthly expenses. While the economic 
conditions were unexpected and beyond Applicant’s control, the degree to which those 
factors had an impact on Applicant’s ability to overcome them has not been adequately 
explained. The SOR alleged five delinquent accounts, but there were actually others 
that were not alleged. Applicant’s response to some accounts was to dispute them, 
either because they were not his debts or because there were extenuating 
circumstances for not resolving them in 2008 or 2009. He challenged unpaid balance 
amounts, but made little efforts to pay the amounts that were not in dispute. He 
obtained the professional services of two different law firms to motivate creditors into 
settlement agreements, but they failed in their efforts. He failed to obtain favorable 
mortgage modifications, and simply stopped paying his monthly mortgage payments. 
Applicant claims he intends to resolve his differences with his creditors, but his actions 
since 2008 reflect a different goal. 
  
Applicant continued to accrue revenue from the rents generated by his two rental 
properties, and income from his other business enterprise, and was seemingly capable 
of meeting most of his financial obligations. He simply decided not to pay his mortgages 
in an apparent effort to force the mortgage lenders to comply with his wishes to lower 
his monthly payments and otherwise modify all of the mortgages. As a result, he 
permitted his mortgages to fall into arrears and become delinquent. Applicant seems 
only concerned with litigation to retain his properties without making the required 
monthly payments. In July 2011, Applicant had an estimated monthly net income, 
including salary and rental income, of between $4,500 and $6,900, and estimated 
monthly expenses of approximately $2,000. With approximately $4,000 to $5,000 in 
discretionary income, which could be used to pay his mortgages and resolve his other 
delinquent accounts, Applicant has, instead, chosen to put it away, rather than use it.  
 
Some of what occurred was beyond Applicant’s control and took place under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. Other than some generic guidance from 
his attorneys, there is no evidence of financial counseling, debt management, or debt 
repayment. There is little indication that the problems associated with his mortgages or 
other delinquent accounts are now being resolved. By failing to make good-faith efforts 
to resolve his delinquent accounts since 2008, Applicant acted irresponsibly under the 
circumstances, and his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, are in 
question. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
13 
                                      
 
                                                          
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have evaluated the various aspects of 
this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a 
piecemeal analysis.103      
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He 
experienced some financial problems because his income diminished with the downturn 
in the economy, he purchased and decorated a new residence in anticipation of a 
marriage that failed to take place, and he had problems with defective appliances and 
shoddy workmanship in the new residence. He disputed some accounts, and sought 
settlements on others. He sought mortgage modifications from his mortgage lenders.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:104 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
103 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

There are some questionable actions by Applicant in handling his delinquent 
accounts. Applicant made a decision to stop paying his monthly mortgage payments for 
his properties. He continued to accrue revenue from the rents generated by his rental 
properties, and income from his other business enterprise, and was seemingly capable 
of meeting most of his financial obligations. He simply decided not to pay his mortgages 
in an effort to force the mortgage lenders to comply with his wishes to lower his monthly 
payments and otherwise modify all of the mortgages. As a result, he permitted his 
mortgages to fall into arrears and become delinquent. As for his credit card and other 
delinquent accounts, Applicant has simply sought to force settlements with the 
assistance of attorneys. He disputed balances, but since 2008, has refused to pay 
undisputed amounts. I conclude that Applicant has failed to establish a meaningful track 
record. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.  
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
       
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
