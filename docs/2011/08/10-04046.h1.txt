GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance or access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 28, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and 
submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a 
1 As noted below, this matter was scheduled for hearing on two occasions, with a March 2011 hearing 
cancelled based on Applicant’s inability to be present. This second hearing was subsequently scheduled for a period 
of Applicant’s agreed presence. One day before the hearing, he engaged the services of Alan V. Edmunds, Esquire, 
an attorney who indicated he was unable to be present for the scheduled hearing. In the mid-afternoon of July 13, 
2011, Mr. Edmunds sent a notice to me and to Department Counsel at our respective offices by facsimile and e-mail, 
but both Department Counsel and I were already out of town involved in other hearings. Our respective offices 
contacted us. I telephoned Mr. Edmunds later that day, but was unable to reach him, so I left a message that I was 
disinclined to grant a continuance without good cause being shown in light of the previous continuance and the last 
moment engagement. I indicated to Applicant that he could supplement the record if he wished to do so. Applicant 
chose to proceed pro se.

Security Clearance Application (SF 86).2 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories pertaining to his 
financial situation. He responded to the interrogatories on August 17, 2010.3 On another 
unspecified date, DOHA issued him another set of interrogatories, again pertaining to 
his financial situation. He responded to the interrogatories on August 17, 2010.4 On 
September 22, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and 
modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all 
adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive after September 1, 
2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), 
and detailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under 
the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a 
security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge 
to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 1, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on November 10, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR 
allegations and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department 
Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on February 4, 2011, and 
the case was assigned to another administrative judge on February 16, 2011. A Notice 
of Hearing was issued on February 22, 2011, for a hearing to be convened on March 2, 
2001, but on February 25, 2011, Applicant requested a continuance, claiming he was 
engaged in military operations abroad, and was not anticipated to return until after the 
scheduled date. The matter was continued, and on April 18, 2011, the case was 
transferred to me. Another Notice of Hearing was issued on June 23, 2011, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on July 14, 2011. The request for a continuance, 
made by his attorney late in the day on July 13, 2011, was denied. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted into 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The record remained open to afford 
Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on July 29, 2011, his attorney submitted 
one exhibit (AE A) which was admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript 
(Tr.) was received on July 25, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted both of the factual allegations in ¶¶ 
1.a. and 1.b. of the SOR. Applicant's admissions are incorporated herein as findings of

fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 65-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
a master or vessel captain,5 and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level 
of which has not been specified. He received a bachelor’s degree in business 
administration in 1969.6 He was previously a mate and master of a vessel with another 
company, and in March 2003, he joined his current employer.7 Applicant has never 
served with the U.S. military.8 He has never been married, and has no children.9  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant has had some credit problems in the past,10 but they had apparently 
been favorably resolved. There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s current financial 
situation until about 2008. In November 2005, the local real estate market was booming, 
with property values appreciating from 15 percent to 25 percent annually.11 Although he 
had never been a real estate investor before, in November 2005, Applicant purchased a 
house with an appraised value of $755,000, financed by a first mortgage and a second 
“purchase money” mortgage, in the total amount of $648,000.12 Over the course of a 
year, he resided in the house and made renovations himself or hired tradesmen to do 
so.13 The renovations were funded by his savings.14 Applicant’s combined monthly 
mortgage payments were $3,650,15 and he was able to remain current on his 
payments.16 In November 2006, he rented the property on a long-term, yearly basis, 
with a rent that nearly covered his mortgage payments.17 The situation remained steady 
until 2008, when the “bottom fell out” of the economy, and he had to reduce the rent to

keep renters in the property.18 Exacerbating his financial problem was that a friend who 
was supposed to take care of his business affairs while he was away from home for up 
to 45 days at a time during work-related absences, failed to do so and made several 
late payments.19 
 
Applicant engaged the professional services of an attorney to negotiate with the 
original mortgage lender, as well as the banks to which the mortgages were later sold, 
in an effort to obtain mortgage modifications.20 Applicant was told by the mortgage 
lenders-holders that he was not eligible, so formal applications were never submitted.21 
Applicant was advised by the mortgage holder that he would not be eligible for a loan 
modification unless he was at least 90 to 120 days past due on his mortgage 
payments.22 In 2008, Applicant attempted to sell the property with short sales 
contracts.23 The initial asking price was $410,000, but it was eventually reduced to 
$300,000.24 There were two offers made for $200,000 and $220,000,25 and the highest 
offer received was for $240,000, or about $400,000 short of the mortgage balance. The 
offers were submitted to the mortgage holders, but nothing was approved.26  
 
His realtor also advised Applicant that to qualify for a short sale, the mortgages 
had to be in arrears, so at some point in 2008, following the realtor’s advice, Applicant 
stopped making his monthly mortgage payments on both mortgages.27 By November 
2009, on his first mortgage with a balance of $518,400, Applicant was delinquent 180 
days or more with a past-due balance of $42,490, and foreclosure proceedings had 
already been initiated.28 On his second mortgage, with a balance of $129,600, he was 
delinquent 180 days or more with a past-due balance of $4,420.29 By August 2010, the

purported mortgage holder had filed lawsuits seeking foreclosure.30 The SOR identified 
only those two debts as continuing delinquencies. One of the suits was previously 
dismissed in 2010, and the plaintiff’s effort to have the decision vacated was denied in 
April 2011.31 In June or July 2011, the remaining case had been assigned to a special 
magistrate, but no hearings are yet scheduled.32 The property has remained rented,

In April 2009, Applicant earned $82,318 in wages, and had an adjusted gross 
income of $57,318, because of a rental real estate loss he sustained in the amount of 
$25,000.34 In August 2010, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) 
reflecting an estimated monthly income of $4,776.52, and monthly expenses of 
$2,585.35 Not included in the income was the rental income,36 so the actual total is 
$7,126.52. Not included in the expenses were monthly credit card payments.37 At the 
time he completed the PFS, Applicant had a current credit card balance of $2,124.61, 
which he paid off, because he does not carry balances, choosing instead to pay off his 
cards each month.38 He has no outstanding balance on any other accounts.39 Applicant

the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”43   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”44 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.45  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”47 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Lik

may be mitigated where “the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control” is potentially 
mitigating under AG ¶ 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows

As noted above, the normal overriding concern pertaining to financial 
considerations in the security clearance context is that “[f]ailure or inability to live within

(emphasis supplied). But these are not “normal” times, for the world in general, and the

To determine if an applicant is (1) an unintentional victim; or (2) a willing 
participant and complicit in an otherwise unwise or irresponsible monetary scheme, or 
(3) a person with poor self-control or lack of judgment, an analysis of the individual’s 
original intentions and actions is essential. In this instance, Applicant’s financial history 
and actions reveal little evidence of poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. To the contrary, his goals were to 
ensure the success of his limited rental venture; to protect his investment; and pay his 
creditors. He originally obtained a first mortgage and a second “purchase-money” 
mortgage from the same mortgage lender with an affordable monthly payment, and 
when the rent payments adjusted downward because of the economic downturn, he set 
out to seek a mortgage modification, and when that seemed impossible, to sell the 
48 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

none of his strategies or attempts succeeded. This same strategy was employed by 
thousands of Americans. His efforts were responsible and disciplined.  
 
There are unusual circumstances in today’s economy in general, as well as a 
series of events involving Applicant’s mortgage loans and subsequent inability to modify 
the mortgages or sell the residence, in particular. Applicant’s actions and his otherwise 
generally average, unremarkable, financial status provide clear indications that, except 
for these two mortgages, all of Applicant’s financial issues have been resolved and are 
under control. While the local real estate market and the U.S. economy have not yet 
rebounded, his actions to mitigate his financial situation, under the circumstances, do 
not cast doubt on Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.49 
AG ¶ 20(a) applies.  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) applies because there were several conditions, largely beyond 
Applicant’s control, that made a substantial negative impact on Applicant’s financial 
situation. The devastated economy and local housing market effectively destroyed 
Applicant’s ability to maintain his rental property, at least in the short term, at the inflated 
rates of the past. The business downturn in the housing market, and its impact on the 
anticipated rent he could obtain, or a possible sale, was extraordinarily severe. They 
caused his financial problems. These events were clearly beyond Applicant’s control, 
and Applicant acted responsibly to address the debts that resulted.50 
 
AG & 20(c) partially applies because, while Applicant has never received 
financial counseling, there is clear and abundant evidence that his financial problems, 
with the exception of his foreclosures, are resolved and are under control. He still has 
the two delinquent mortgages, has established a budget, presented a personal financial 
statement, and has avoided any other delinquencies.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) partially applies because Applicant attempted to address his two 
delinquent mortgages well before the SOR was issued. Nevertheless, circumstances 
were such that he was unable to resolve them all either by mortgage modification or 
short sale, although he attempted to do so.51 He has maintained all of his other 
accounts in a current status. The sole exceptions are the foreclosure actions for his 
home mortgage and his “purchase money” second mortgage, with one of those 
foreclosure actions having been dismissed by the court, with a subsequent effort to 
have the dismissal vacated, dismissed by the court. The remaining action is awaiting a 
decision by the special magistrate.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant has a 
“history” of financial delinquencies commencing in 2008. He permitted his first and 
second home mortgages to become delinquent, and both fell into a pre-foreclosure 
status. Both mortgages were the subjects of foreclosure litigation, with one of the 
lawsuits being dismissed, but the other still pending before a special magistrate. The 
property has remained rented, and Applicant continues to receive $2,350 each month 
which goes into his “general funds,” rather than being applied to his mortgages. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. 
Applicant’s financial delinquencies were the unfortunate consequence of a devastated 
economy and local housing market. Upon the realization that he could not sustain the 
level of rent he had previously realized, Applicant lowered the rent or risked having a 
vacant property. He followed the advice of an attorney and a realtor in seeking 
mortgage modifications as well as short sales, but nothing has worked. Applicant is 
current in all other accounts. Of course, the issue is not simply whether both of 
Applicant’s mortgages have been resolved; it is whether his financial circumstances 
raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. I am mindful that while any 
one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s credit history in a less than 
sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality 
of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.52 His 
substantial good-faith efforts are sufficient to mitigate continuing security concerns. See 
AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9).

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
