O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the 
guideline for financial considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security 
clearance is denied. 
  
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 14, 2009, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required for his 
employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing 
background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and

Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s request.  
 
 On May 17, 2010, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the 
Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines (AG).2 In his Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized on August 3, 
2010, Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline F except 
subparagraphs 1.k., 1.x., and 1.y. He also requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge.  
 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 31, 2010, and 
the case was assigned to me on September 7, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of 
Hearing on September 15, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
October 13, 2010. During the hearing, the Government offered seven exhibits, 
marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7.3 Applicant objected to the 
1996 bankruptcy petition as irrelevant. I overruled the objection, and admitted the 
seven Government exhibits. Applicant testified, and offered eight exhibits, 
admitted without objection as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through H. I held the 
record open for Applicant to submit additional documentation. He timely 
submitted seven documents, admitted without objection as AE I through O. 
DOHA received the transcript on January 21, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After 
a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and the 
evidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional findings of 
fact. 
 
 Applicant, who is 37 years old, completed all but ten credits required for a 
bachelors degree. He served in the U.S. Army from 1992 to 1996, where he held 
a security clearance. He received an Army Certificate of Achievement in 1995, as 
well as three Army Commendation Medals in 1994 and 1995. He married in 
1995, and has two adopted sons, four and nine years of age. He spent 
approximately $4,000 to $6,000 on the two adoptions. The four-year-old boy is a 
special-needs child who requires occupational, educational, and speech therapy. 
Applicant's health insurance covers most of the costs. Applicant has been a 
1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as 
amended. 
 
2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) implemented by the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  
 
3 The Government presented a 1996 bankruptcy petition and a 2005 bankruptcy petition, 
combined in one document. For administrative convenience, I separated the two petitions, which 
were admitted as GE 4 and 5, respectively.

surrogate father to his wife’s three stepchildren, and supported two of them for 
several years. In addition, several years ago he learned that a friend of his 
stepdaughter was being neglected by her parents. He has provided a home for 
her since she was 15 years old. Now 21, she remains in Applicant's home, and 
he continues to support her financially. (AE E; Tr. 60, 64, 81-91, 92-96)  
 
 Applicant has worked for a defense contractor since November 2008, 
currently holding the position of lead network engineer. The information 
assurance manager at the federal agency where Applicant works has known him 
for two years. He submitted a letter citing Applicant's professionalism and 
dedication to protecting government assets. He trusts Applicant's judgment. 
Another co-worker who has worked with Applicant for two years notes Applicant's 
expertise and willingness to share his knowledge. He describes Applicant as 
reliable, conscientious, and hard-working. (GE 1; AE E, F, G; Tr. 79-80, 97-99) 
 
 While in military service, Applicant testified he had a substantial income 
because he received additional allowances for his family, meals, and his 
“airborne” status. However, in 1996, after leaving the Army, Applicant had 
accrued debts and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. He paid approximately 
$800 per month under the wage-earner plan. The bankruptcy was discharged 
successfully in 1999. Subsequently, Applicant was unemployed for about 10 
months between 2001 and 2002, and then for about three months in 2004. He 
obtained financial help from family and friends. Between 2002 and 2005, he was 
continuously employed on a number of short-term contracts. He then obtained a 
permanent job in January 2005. His delinquencies had mounted between 2001 
and 2005, and in May 2005, he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition to have his 
debts discharged. However, the bankruptcy court determined that he had 
sufficient funds to support a wage-earner plan, and Applicant converted to a 
Chapter 13. He was unable to meet the payments, and the bankruptcy was 
dismissed in 2007. The bankruptcy trustee advised him to negotiate settlements 
with any creditor who subsequently sought payment, but not to pay those who 
did not contact him, because the statute of limitations would soon make the debts 
uncollectible. (GE 4, 5, 6, 7; Tr. 28-39, 106, 112-116)  
 
 Around 1999, Applicant became an independent contractor. After 
September 11, 2001, he did not receive as much business as he had expected. 
In addition, he did not understand the proper tax-filing procedures for 
independent contractors. His father-in-law and his wife handled the family tax 
returns. Applicant also sought assistance from a commercial tax counseling 
company, but was unsatisfied and discontinued the service. His documentation 
shows that he paid self-employment tax in tax years 1999 through 2001, but 
none in 2002 through 2006. He received notices of delinquencies from both the 
IRS and his state of residence until, in 2004, both the IRS and the state filed liens 
for unpaid taxes. Applicant testified that he had a payment arrangement with the 
IRS “for quite a period of time.” He testified that he made payments by check to 
both the IRS and the state. However, he did not provide copies of checks, or 
 
 
4  
copies of IRS or state payment histories to support his claim. He did provide 
evidence of two payments made to the IRS in 2010. (GE 2; AE B, M; Tr. 118-
123) 
 
 Applicant admitted in his December 2009 interrogatory response that he 
did not follow up on his statements during his security interview that he would 
work on several debts within the next 60 days. He testified that he only recently 
contacted some of his creditors because he was not sure how to proceed, and he 
was not in a position to pay them until he had adjusted his budget by reducing 
other expenses. (GE 2; Tr. 110-111) 
 
 Applicant’s net pay in 2009 was $129,862; as of October 2010, he had 
earned net pay of $86,565. His net monthly income is $9,412. His monthly 
expenses and debt payments total $9,318, leaving a monthly net remainder of 
$94. His personal financial statement does not indicate Applicant spends money 
frivolously. He does not have a savings account, and does not contribute to a 
retirement plan. Applicant's wife handles the family’s finances. (AE I, N, O; Tr. 
183) 
 
 The 28 debts listed in the SOR accrued between 2003 and 2009, and total 
approximately $72,583. The delinquencies appear in Applicant's credit reports of 
April 2009 and January 2010. (GE 6, 7) The status of the SOR debts follows. 
 
• Bankruptcies (allegations 1.a, 1.b.) Applicant filed a Chapter 13 
bankruptcy petition in 1996, which was discharged in 1999. He filed a 
Chapter 7 petition in May 2005, but the court required him to convert it to a 
Chapter 13. He was unable to meet the payments, and the bankruptcy 
was dismissed in 2007. (GE 1; Tr. 28-39) 
 
• Judgment re property debt, $1,689 (allegation 1.c) Applicant bought a 
timeshare, and fell behind in his payments. After he surrendered the 
deed, the creditor re-sold the timeshare. Applicant believes the debt 
represents annual maintenance fees. He contacted the creditor and, as of 
the hearing date, he was awaiting a final balance so that he could arrange 
a payment plan. He provided the name of his contact, but no supporting 
documentation. (Tr. 39-42) 
 
• State tax liens: $21,174 alleged; $18,488 currently owed: (allegations 
1.d, e, f, h) In approximately 2006, Applicant began a payment plan for 
his unpaid state taxes. He paid $250 per month by automatic deduction 
from his salary. When he changed employers, he notified the state 
comptroller’s office of his new contact information, but the state did not 
resume deductions. He did not pursue the matter. The day before the 
hearing, he set up a plan for $270 per month to be deducted from his pay. 
The state comptroller notified his employer of the lien on October 13, 
2010. The debt will be satisfied in eight-and-one-half years. As of 
 
 
5  
                                                     
November 3, 2010, his unpaid taxes for tax years 2000 through 2007, 
with interest and penalties, totaled $18,488.47.4 (GE 3; AE A, J, K; Tr. 44-
49) 
 
$   IRS tax liens: $43,958 alleged; $31,838 currently owed: (allegation 
1.g.) Applicant's April 2009 credit bureau report shows his IRS debt to be 
$28,888. Applicant's wages were garnished, until he made payment 
arrangements with the IRS. In his interrogatory response of December 
2009, Applicant indicated the debt was $43,958.65. He did not have a 
payment plan in place at that time. AE B shows that he submitted no 
payments to the IRS between July 2009 and July 2010. At the hearing, he 
testified that he has been negotiating with the IRS for about one year. In 
2010, he amended his past returns, resulting in a credit to his account of 
$12,964. The outstanding balance as of July 2010 is $31,838.50. In July 
2010, he established a payment plan of $300 per month. He provided 
evidence of two payments made in September and October 2010, each 
credited to the 2003 tax year. (GE 1, 3, 6; AE B, M; Tr. 49-53)  
 
• Utilities debts totaling $1,482 (allegations 1.i., 1.j., 1.k.) – Applicant 
was not aware of final bills for two cable service companies (allegations 
1.i. and 1.j.). He contacted the creditors before the hearing, but could not 
negotiate payment arrangements. Applicant plans to pay one by February 
2011 and the other by March 2011. He was also unaware that his current 
cable provider charged him when he changed his service (allegation 1.k.). 
In October 2010, Applicant negotiated a payment plan with the collection 
agency to deduct four monthly installments of $165 from his checking 
account, starting in October 2010. (AE C; Tr. 54-57) 
 
• Student loans totaling $2,431 (allegations 1.l. through 1.w.) – 
Applicant's student loans were deferred while he was attending college. 
After he left school, the loans became due, and went into default when he 
did not pay them.5 He tried to extend his deferment, but his request was 
denied. Two weeks before the hearing, Applicant contacted the guarantor 
for five of his student loans. He negotiated a payment plan of $100 per 
month starting in October 25, 2010, after the hearing. If he makes the 
payments for nine months, five of his loans will be rehabilitated. After six 
months of payments, he will be in good standing and can obtain student 
loans to finish his degree. He might return to school, which will return the 
loans to a deferred status. (AE D; Tr. 59-66) 
 
4 Applicant did not owe back taxes for 2002 and 2008 because his withholding exceeded his tax 
obligation. The IRS seized refunds and applied them to his unpaid tax obligations. (AE J; Tr. 122) 
 
5 The loans listed in the SOR amount to $2,431. However, the total loan balance Applicant owes 
to the creditor with whom he arranged his plan, is $20,957. He has seven additional student loans 
guaranteed by another company, which total approximately $30,000. (Tr. 65-66) 
 
 
6  
                                                     
• Auto loan, $1,109 (allegation 1.x) – Applicant denied this allegation. He 
admits he was late on two car payments that totaled $1,109, stating that 
at the time he had an unexpected expense of moving his family to a new 
location. He testified that he subsequently brought the loan up to date, but 
provided no evidence to support his claim. (GE 7; Tr. 67-68) 
 
$        Medical debts totaling $352 (allegations 1.z. and 1.aa) – Applicant 
admits the hospital bill alleged at 1.z. ($97). He expected his health 
insurance to cover it, but he changed jobs and it was not covered by his 
previous employer’s plan. He expects to pay it in February 2011. (AE H; 
Tr. 69-71) As to allegation 1.aa. ($255), the week of the hearing Applicant 
set up a three-month payment plan for $85 per month, starting November 
2010. He noted these planned payments in his future budget, but did not 
provide documentation at or after the hearing supporting his statements or 
payments. (AE H; Tr. 71-72) 
 
$   Miscellaneous debts totaling $388 (allegations 1.y. and 1.bb) 
Applicant denied allegation 1.y., ($174) which relates to a debt to a music 
service company because he did not open the account. However, his 
research showed that an account was opened in his name and at his 
address. A few days before the hearing, he arranged a plan to pay three 
installments of $58 per month, starting November 2010. He noted these 
planned payments in his future budget, but did not provide documentation 
at or after the hearing showing payments. Applicant disputes owing the 
library fine alleged at 1.bb. ($214). If his dispute is not successful, he 
plans to pay the debt in January 2011. (AE H: Tr. 68-69, 72-73)  
 
Policies 
 
 Each security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and 
material information, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication 
policy in the AG.6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in 
¶ 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the “whole-person” concept. 
 
 The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does 
not determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific 
applicable guidelines are followed when a case can be measured against them 
as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented 
by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative 
factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at AG ¶ 18. 
 
6 Directive 6.3 
 
 
 
7  
                                                     
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest7 for an applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the 
initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the 
preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. 
Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in 
the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to 
refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.  
 
 Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a 
heavy burden of persuasion.8 A person who has access to classified information 
enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and 
confidence. Therefore, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect 
the national interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national 
interest” standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an 
applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.9 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and 
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of 
which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An 
individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a 
concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is 
also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially 
profitable criminal acts. 
 
 The evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG ¶19 (a) 
(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG ¶19 (c) (a history of not 
meeting financial obligations). The SOR alleges $65,132 in unpaid back taxes 
owed to the federal and state governments. After filing amendments to his 
federal returns, his total taxes amount to $50,326. He also owes approximately 
7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). 
 
8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. 
 
9 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
8  
$4,600 in other debts. He had two bankruptcies in 1996 and 2005. His current 
debts became delinquent starting in 2003. Applicant's history demonstrates a 
failure to meet financial obligations. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Although Applicant's debts have been accruing for years, they are not in 
the distant past, as approximately $55,000 remains unpaid. His past inattention 
to his financial obligations may recur in the future. His failure to make consistent 
attempts to resolve his debts over the years, until recently, raises questions as to 
his reliability and judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) focuses on situations where conditions beyond an applicant’s 
control affect his ability to meet his financial obligations. Although one of 
Applicant's children has needs that require continuous health care, Applicant 
admits that his medical insurance has covered most of those costs. Applicant 
cites a decrease in business after September 11, and two periods of 
unemployment as events beyond his control. However, the business downturn 
due to September 11 occurred ten years ago. Applicant was unemployed for a 
total of about one year between 2001 and 2004. This unemployment occurred 
more than six years ago; it should not have an affect on his ability to pay current 
debts, especially in light of Applicant's substantial income. AG ¶ 20(b) does not 
apply.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant 
displayed such efforts when he met the requirements of his Chapter 13 wage-
earner plan bankruptcy, and it was successfully discharged in 1999. However, by 
2005, he had accrued enough new debt that he sought a discharge through a 
Chapter 7 petition. The bankruptcy court found that he had sufficient income to 
support another wage-earner plan. However, he did not meet the payment 
requirements, and it was dismissed. 
 
 
 
9  
 Applicant testified that he made payments on his state and IRS tax liens in 
the past. However, he did not follow through to ensure that the state re-
established its garnishment when he changed employers. He did not provide 
proof of his claim of payments made years ago to the IRS. 
 
 Several events placed Applicant on notice that his current delinquent 
debts were a security concern: his security clearance application in April 2009, 
his security interview shortly thereafter, and the DOHA interrogatories he 
completed in December 2009. Yet most of his efforts to contact creditors and 
establish payment plans occurred in late 2010, just before the hearing. He has 
not sought financial counselling. He has made no effort to pay even relatively 
small debts. He placed his finances in the hands of his father-in-law and wife, 
without taking action once their efforts resulted in tax liens. He let his unpaid 
taxes mount and accrue interest charges and penalties. Applicant has 
established some payment plans, but they are so recent that he cannot provide 
evidence that he has implemented them, or demonstrate a track record of 
payments. AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate 
an applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented 
and have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I 
have also reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the 
appropriate guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. 
 
 Applicant has demonstrated character and generosity in his personal life, 
adopting two children, including a special needs child, and supporting his wife’s 
stepchildren, as well as a friend of the family. He successfully discharged a 
 
 
10  
wage-earner bankruptcy, which required that he meet payments for a period of 
three years. In addition, his coworkers laud his trustworthiness and dependability.  
 
 However, other record evidence indicates that Applicant has not 
demonstrated reliability in handling his financial obligations since the Chapter 13 
was discharged in 1999. His reliance on others to manage his debts and his tax 
returns, as well as his failure to stay abreast of numerous debts, can be ascribed 
in part to his youth: he was 23 at the time of his first bankruptcy, and 27 when his 
tax problems began. But he is now 37, a mature adult, and his lack of diligence 
about his obligations to the state and federal governments for the past several 
years is a serious concern. Before amending his federal returns, he owed more 
than $43,000 to the federal government. He provided no proof of the payments 
he said he made in the past on the IRS debt. He allowed his delinquent state tax 
debt to grow to more than $21,000. He did set up several payment plans, but not 
until just before his hearing. Applicant appears to have responded only because 
he was prodded by the security process. His lack of attention to some debts, and 
sporadic efforts on others, do not demonstrate reliability and good judgment.  
 
A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information shows 
that Applicant has not satisfied the doubts raised about his suitability for a 
security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by 
section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST Applicant 
 
 Subparagraph 1.a.     For Applicant  
 
 Subparagraphs 1.b. - 1.bb.   Against Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant’s request for 
a security clearance is denied.
