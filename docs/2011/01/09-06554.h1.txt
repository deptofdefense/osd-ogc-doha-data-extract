MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant owed about $18,043.62 in delinquent credit card debt and $156 in past due 
medical debt as of January 2010. He was also behind about $3,392 on his mortgage. 
Financial concerns are mitigated because he settled or satisfied the debts by refinancing his 
mortgage in February 2010, and the debts were incurred because of factors outside of his 
control. Personal conduct concerns are not mitigated because Applicant falsely denied any 
delinquent debt when he applied for his security clearance and he has not shown that the 
Government can rely on his representations. Clearance denied. 
 
 Statement of the Case  
 
On March 5, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline 
F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) that provided the basis 
for its preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
 
  
 
 2 
1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of 
September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on March 24, 2010, and he requested a 
decision by a DOHA administrative judge without a hearing. A hearing was subsequently 
requested, and on May 6, 2010, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for 
Applicant. On May 17, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for June 8, 2010. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Applicant appeared with legal counsel, who 
entered his appearance at that time. Eight Government exhibits (Ex. 1-8) and eight 
Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H) were entered into evidence without objection. Applicant also 
testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 18, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleged that as of March 2010, Applicant owed $29,500 in delinquent 
consumer credit debt (SOR 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.g, 1.i), $156 in medical debt (SOR 1.c), and 
$3,392 on his mortgage loan, which was 120 days or more past due (SOR 1.h). Under 
Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified a May 2009 security 
clearance application by responding “No” to whether he had been over 180 days 
delinquent on any debts in the last seven years, and to whether he was currently over 90 
days delinquent on any debts (SOR 2.a). Applicant denied that the debts remained unpaid, 
because the debts had been settled or paid in full on February 17, 2010, through 
refinancing his mortgage. Applicant acknowledged that he has responded “No” to the 
financial inquiries as alleged, but he denied deliberate falsification. After considering the 
pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 48-year-old high school graduate, who has been employed as a rigger 
by a defense contractor since February 2009. He previously worked for the company from 
June 1982 to September 1992. (Ex. 1, 2; Tr. 20-21, 32.) Applicant holds a company-
granted confidential security clearance, and he held that clearance during his previous 
employment. (Tr. 22). 
 
Applicant and his spouse have been married for 23 years and they have three 
teenage children. (Ex. 1; Tr. 31.) They have lived in the same town since 1987 (Tr. 20) and 
in their present home since 2001. (Tr. 46.) Applicant worked as an inside carpenter (“model 
joiner”) for his current employer from 1982 until 1992. (Tr. 32.) Around August 1992, the 
company had a large layoff, and Applicant was transferred to outside construction. (Ex. 2; 
Tr. 22.) He left for a construction job with a local casino, and when the casino downsized 
the number of construction workers at the site, he drove a sand and gravel truck. (Tr. 22-
23.) In 1997, Applicant began working for a food service company. For the next ten years, 
he drove a delivery truck. (Ex. 1; Tr. 23.)  
  
 
 3 
 
Due to an on-the-job injury sustained in July 2005, Applicant was out-of-work on 
workmen‟s compensation until January 2006. Although his medical costs were covered, his 
income was reduced by about 40% (Tr. 88.) He and his spouse began to fall behind in their 
financial obligations. (Ex. 2.) In November 2006, their youngest daughter was diagnosed 
with a medical condition requiring life-long prescription medication for survival. They were 
immediately faced with monthly prescription deductibles. In June 2007, Applicant and his 
spouse incurred out-of-pocket costs in excess of $2,000 for a medical device for their 
daughter. (Ex. 2, Tr. 27-28.) 
 
In November 2007, Applicant was laid off from the food service company in a 
company downsizing. Until May 2008, he helped a friend with his landscaping business. 
(Ex. 1; Tr. 89.) For the next ten months, he worked off and on as a union truck driver, 
taking assignments when available. From May 2008 to December 2008, he drove a truck 
for a construction company. The union made an effort to find jobs for him, but there were 
times, as long as three or four months, where he had no work. He collected unemployment 
during those periods, and he continued to carry medical insurance, but his premium 
increased to $1,200 to $1,500 a month when he was out of work. (Tr. 24-26, 29-30.)

The Government alleged the debt twice, as a judgment balance (SOR 1.a) and as a charged off debt (SOR 
1.d). The credit bureaus reported balances of $4,136 as of June 2009 (Ex. 5.) and $4,495 as of February 2010 
(Ex. 6.), likely due to accrued interest. As of April 2010, the balance of the debt was $860. (Ex. 7.) By June 
2010, the account was listed as “paid for less than full balance.” (Ex. 8.) Although the judgment was still listed 
separately, court records,  submitted as Exhibit A, show the judgment was satisfied as of March 9, 2001. (Ex.

In February 2009, Applicant began working as a rigger for his employer. (Tr. 32.) 
While his hourly wage was lower than in previous jobs, the job provided a reliable paycheck 
plus benefits. (Ex. 2.) On May 19, 2009, he completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) for a security clearance. He responded negatively to the 
financial record inquiries, which have a seven-year scope unless otherwise specified, 
including 26.g (“Have you had any bills or debts turned over to a collection agency?”), 26.h 
(“Have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing 
to pay as agreed?”), 26.m (“Have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”), 
and 26.n (“Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?”). (Ex. 1.) However, a 
check of Applicant‟s credit on June 9, 2009, disclosed some credit card accounts charged 
off or placed for collection or both and that he and his spouse were behind $3,166 or 60 
days on their mortgage. (Ex. 5.) 
 
 In early July 2009, Applicant fractured his shoulder at work. (Tr. 34-35). While out of 
work for three months, he was paid workmen‟s compensation of $500 per week, which put 
a strain on the family‟s finances. (Tr. 36-37.) Applicant notified his creditors that he was out 
of work, and he paid what he could on his mortgage loan. (Tr. 38.) While he was out of 
work, he was interviewed on August 19, 2009, by a Government investigator about his 
delinquent debts. He was asked about debts on his credit report. He indicated that he fell 
behind due to a job layoff and his daughter‟s medical expenses, which he paid from 
savings. Applicant indicated that he had been in contact with the creditors owed the debts 
identified in SOR 1.a and 1.e about payment arrangements. He expressed his belief (albeit 
mistaken) that the debt in SOR 1.b was a retail charge account and added that he had 
  
 
 5 
been calling to arrange for repayment. Applicant surmised that the collection debts in SOR 
1.f and 1.g were credit card debts, but he was not sure. He asserted he was current on all 
his other bills. (Ex. 4.) He was behind in his mortgage, home equity, and automobile loans 
but making some payments. (Ex. 3, 5.)  
 
 Applicant returned to work in October 2009. (Tr. 39.) In early December 2009, 
Applicant was promoted to first class rigger, which brought a “much needed significant 
increase” in his hourly rate to $23.65. (Ex. 2, Tr. 40-41.) At DOHA‟s request, Applicant 
provided a detailed account of his finances in late January 2010. He reported a net monthly 
deficit of $202.52 after paying the household expenses and three debts (mortgage, home 
equity, and automobile loans). He explained that his lengthy unemployment and the cost of 
COBRA insurance made it “almost impossible” to pay on their other debts, and that when 
finances became tight, he and his spouse refrained from incurring any new debt. Through 
refinancing their mortgage with a new loan preapproved for $225,000, they planned to pay 
off their delinquent debts and home equity loan, and to bring their automobile loan current.
2
 
(Ex. 2.) As to the accuracy of the investigator‟s report of the August 2009 interview, 
Applicant explained that when he said he was current on all his other bills, he meant credit 
card accounts and not his mortgage, home equity, and automobile loans, which were 
behind, but he was making payments. (Ex. 3.) 
 
 Applicant and his spouse refinanced their mortgage in mid-February 2010, taking on 
a 30-year real estate loan of $232,000. With the funds paid out to them in the refinancing, 
they satisfied the $40,918.81 balance of their home equity loan and settled the debts in the 
SOR.  (Ex. A-G.) 
 
 On March 5, 2010, DOHA issued an SOR to Applicant due to his history of financial 
delinquency and failure to disclose on his May 2009 e-QIP that some accounts had been 
past due over 180 days in the last seven years and that he was over 90 days delinquent on 
some obligations as of May 2009. Applicant explained in his March 22, 2010 answer to the 
SOR that he began to fall behind in some payments in July 2005, and that due to his 
daughter‟s medical problems and his unexpected layoff in November 2007, he had been 
unable to clear up his delinquent debts. With the stability of his defense contractor 
employment, he had recently settled his debts. Concerning his omission of delinquent debt 
from his e-QIP, Applicant stated the following: 
 
I admit that I answered no to having any delinquencies over 180 days. This 
was my fault in the interview because I was thinking of my current bills and 
not accounts that had been charged-off and I rarely received any 
documentation in the mail for. I also had not pulled or looked at my credit 
report prior to the interview. The last credit report that I had looked at was 
almost 10 years ago when I obtained a construction mortgage for my house.  
 
                                                 
2 
The statement Applicant furnished was directed to the bank for the mortgage refinancing, and it appears to 
have been drafted by his spouse.
 
  
 
 6 
I admit that I answered no to not being over 90 days delinquent on any debts 
but I deny that I deliberately failed to disclose the debts in subparagraphs 
1.b, 1.h. At the interview I admitted to all the debts on the credit report and 
misunderstood that I was being asked if there was any other debts other than 
what was listed on the credit report which there were not. I was not over 90 
days delinquent on the mortgage at the time of the interview and was 
currently making monthly payments. 
  
 In mid-May 2010, Applicant‟s mother died and he inherited her estate, which 
includes her house, vehicle, and between $120,000 and $160,000 in a retirement fund. (Tr. 
44-45.) As of June 2010, Applicant had $26,592.21 on deposit in his bank account (Ex. H.), 
and he expected to receive $184,000 that was in an account held jointly with his mother. 
(Tr. 79-80.) 
 
 Applicant was working overtime almost every weekend as of June 2010. (Tr. 39.) 
His spouse was employed as a part-time bookkeeper for a small trucking company. (Tr. 
70.) Applicant no longer has any open credit card accounts (Ex. 8; Tr. 76.), and he has not 
used a credit card in “more than a few years.” (Tr. 117.) He and his spouse shared 
payment responsibility for their credit card debts in the past, although she writes the 
checks. (Tr. 94, 125-26.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a „right‟ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant‟s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge‟s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
  
 
 7 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as 
to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of 
Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest 
and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See 
also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or 
sensitive information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18, as follows:  
     
Failure or inability to live within one‟s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG 
¶ 19. Two are applicable in this case: (a) “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;” and (c) 
“a history of not meeting financial obligations.” When Applicant applied for a security 
clearance in May 2009, he owed about $18,043.62 in delinquent credit card debt and $156 
in past due medical debt. He had made no payments on the credit card accounts in the 
year preceding his application, and his largest debt (SOR 1.b) had been outstanding since 
June 2006. In addition, he was 60 days past due on his mortgage loan. 
  
  Five Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual‟s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
  
 
 8 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person‟s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e) applies in limited part in that the debt listed in SOR 1.b is an updated 
balance of the debt in SOR 1.i. The evidence does not establish that Applicant owed an 
additional balance of $8,000 as alleged in SOR 1.i. While Applicant was shown to owe two 
separate debts to the creditor identified in SOR 1.a, the $4,495 alleged in SOR 1.d appears 
to include accumulated interest on the MasterCard debt that was taken to judgment. 
Applicant‟s evidence shows that he had a past due VISA account balance of $1,422 that 
he settled for $1,067. He successfully disputed the balance alleged in SOR 1.d. 
 
The recency of Applicant‟s financial problems precludes favorable consideration of 
AG ¶ 20(a). While it is unclear when the charges were incurred, the credit information of 
record indicates last activity dates of January 2008 on the debt in SOR 1.a, June 2006 on 
the debt in SOR 1.b (SOR 1.i duplicate debt), May 2008 on the debt in SOR 1.e, April 2008 
on the debt in SOR 1.f, and November 2007 on the debt in SOR 1.g. Furthermore, the 
debts were unresolved as of January 2010. 
 
However, mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(b) applies. Applicant‟s financial struggles 
started with an on-the-job injury in July 2005 that left him unable to work until January 
2006. Then, in November 2006, his younger daughter was diagnosed with a medical 
condition requiring life-long prescription medication. In addition to monthly co-pay costs, 
Applicant and his spouse incurred a $2,000 debt in June 2007 related to their daughter‟s 
care. In November 2007, Applicant was laid off from the job he had held for ten years. 
While he worked as a landscaper for his friend until May 2008, he and his spouse had 
COBRA costs for medical insurance that they had to maintain for their daughter. 
Applicant‟s employment in 2008 was on-and-off depending on work available through the 
union. The loss of income and increased medical expenses are unforeseen circumstances 
beyond Applicant‟s control that led him or his spouse to stop paying on the credit card 
debts at issue. As for whether Applicant acted responsibly with regard to his debts once he 
began working for his current employer, he was on the job for only about six months when 
  
 
 9 
he broke his shoulder. He was out of work until October 2009. As reflected in the monthly 
expense and debt figures he provided in late January 2010, he did not have the funds to 
repay his delinquent debt. As soon as he was financially able, he began to take 
responsibility for settling his debts by refinancing his home mortgage. AG ¶ 20(b) also 
applies to mitigate his delay in addressing his delinquencies. 
 
After Applicant returned to work, he and his spouse began the process of 
refinancing their mortgage for the funds needed to settle their delinquent debt. By late 
January 2010, they had been approved for a $225,000 loan (Ex. 2.), and with the real 
estate closing on February 17, 2010, they settled their debts. AG ¶ 20(c) and ¶ 20(d) are 
pertinent. While resolution of the debt does not necessarily preclude future financial 
problems, Applicant‟s financial situation has improved dramatically in the last six months. In 
addition to taking advantage of overtime at work, Applicant has come into substantial funds 
on the death of his mother. He had $26,592 on deposit in his account and expected 
another $184,000 from a joint account he held with his mother. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
 The security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG ¶15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about 
an individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid 
answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to 
cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
Applicant listed no delinquent debts on his May 2009 security clearance application, 
despite owing several collection balances (SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g). In his answer, he 
admitted that he responded negatively to questions 26.m and 26.n on his e-QIP, but he 
now denies any intentional falsification. Citing his failure to obtain his credit report, he 
maintains he did not know that he was seriously behind on his credit card debts when he 
completed his e-QIP (“When I signed that [e-QIP], I did not know I was at all, I knew I 
struggled a little bit. . .I wrote truthfully I didn‟t believe that I was behind that far.” (Tr. 75-
76.) 
 
The evidence establishes that while Applicant may not have known about a couple 
of his debts, he certainly knew that he had outstanding delinquent credit card balances that 
were not settled until February 17, 2010. When Applicant was initially confronted by his 
adverse credit information in an August 2009 interview, he did not recognize the collection 
debts identified in SOR 1.f and 1.g, and I accept that he may not have known about those 
debts. He mistakenly indicated that the debt in SOR 1.b was for department store credit 
extended to him, but he did not deny the past due balance nor the credit card 
delinquencies in SOR 1.a (duplicated in SOR 1.d) and SOR 1.e. To the contrary, he 
indicated he was in the process of arranging for repayment of those accounts.  And, when 
  
 
 10 
he responded to the SOR in March 2010, Applicant detailed the circumstances that led to 
charged-off balances. He added that during his subject interview, he had focused on his 
current bills, and not charged-off accounts for which he had “rarely received any 
documentation in the mail.” But he did not indicate that his omission of delinquent debt 
from his e-QIP was due to a misunderstanding or lack of knowledge about his debts, with 
the possible exception of the debts in SOR 1.b and 1.h which he denied he deliberately 
failed to disclose. 
 
Even if Applicant‟s spouse paid more of the bills than he did (Tr. 128.) and Applicant 
received no collection notices, he knew that he had credit card debt that he was unable to 
pay in 2006 and 2007 after he was laid off, and in 2009 after he was injured on the job. (Tr. 
100-02.) One Personal Conduct disqualifying condition under AG ¶ 16 is implicated: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, 
award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
Had Applicant testified at his hearing in a credible manner consistent with his 
previous representations, he would have gone a long way toward establishing reform of his 
e-QIP omissions. Instead, he testified that he was unaware that he was over 180 days 
delinquent on any obligations (Tr. 72, 75.); that he “maybe didn‟t understand the 
statements that [he] answered (Tr. 83.); that there was some debt on his credit record that 
he did not know he had (Tr. 96.); that he must have been making payments on his debts as 
of his e-QIP since he responded “No” to the debt inquiries (Tr. 99.); that he did not know he 
was over 180 days late on any obligation because he “was never contacted by anybody” 
(Tr. 100, 118.); that he did not know that he had all that credit card debt (Tr. 102, 108.); 
that he “went to the 180 day mark” and didn‟t think he had the debt (Tr. 119.). But he also 
made admissions that indicate knowledge of his financial problems: that he had made 
some effort to “try to talk with people” when he was having problems paying his debts (Tr. 
96.); that he “probably” contacted the creditor in SOR 1.a sometime after his May 2009 e-
QIP although he could not recall what prompted the contact (Tr. 123.); and that both he 
and his spouse discuss their bills, and that he pays those that he can in person while his 
spouse writes the checks for the others. (Tr. 125-26.) Applicant knew more about his 
financial problems that he is now willing to acknowledge. When he answered the SOR, he 
admitted that he had no disposable income during his unemployment “to make any 
payments at all on the credit cards,” but that on the successful refinancing of his mortgage 
in February 2010, “all of [his and his spouse‟s] charged-off credit cards, other debts were 
settled.” Yet, he responded “No” on his e-QIP to whether he had any account or credit card 
suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. The Government 
established its case under AG ¶ 16(a). 
 
None of the potentially mitigating conditions fully apply. AG ¶ 17(a) (“the individual 
made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification 
  
 
 11 
before being confronted with the facts”) applies to the extent that Applicant admitted some 
of the debts when he was interviewed in August 2009. But Applicant acknowledged the 
debts in SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e in response to adverse credit information brought to his 
attention by the investigator, so his rectification was not without confrontation. Furthermore, 
given his unwillingness to acknowledge his lack of candor on his e-QIP, I cannot apply 
either AG 17(c) (“the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment” ) 
or AG ¶ 17(d) (“the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counselling to 
change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, 
or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such 
behavior is unlikely to recur”). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant‟s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and 
all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual‟s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of 
the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
Applicant and his spouse struggled financially due to the loss of his income and 
medical expenses for their daughter. They have since resolved the debts and their financial 
situation improved substantially to where recurrence of the financial problems appears 
unlikely. But personal conduct concerns persist because of Applicant‟s deliberate omission 
of serious financial delinquency from his security clearance application, and his failure to 
demonstrate that the Government can rely on his representations. While I can appreciate 
Applicant‟s desire to retain the job that he needs to support his family, reform is not 
demonstrated by vague and inconsistent accounts about his contacts with creditors and his 
knowledge of his debts.

Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   For Applicant

 Subparagraph 2.a:   Against Applicant 
 
 Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
