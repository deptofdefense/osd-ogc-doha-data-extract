HOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: 
 
On May 18, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued  a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline 
F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense after 
September 1, 2006.  
  
 On June 5, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 24, 2010. 
The case was assigned to another administrative judge on June 28, 2010 and 
transferred to me on July 30, 2010. On August 13, 2010, a Notice of Hearing was 
issued, scheduling the hearing for September 15, 2010. The hearing was cancelled on 
September 14, 2010, because of unforeseen circumstances and rescheduled for 
October 28, 2010. The case was heard on that date. During the hearing, the 
Government offered seven exhibits which were admitted as Government Exhibits (Gov) 
1 – 7. Applicant testified and offered 12 exhibits which were admitted as Applicant 
 
2 
 
 
Exhibits (AE) A - L. The record was held open until November 12, 2010, to allow 
Applicant to submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted a five-page 
document that was admitted as AE M with no objection. Department Counsel’s 
response to AE M is marked as HE I. The transcript (Tr) was received on November 5, 
2010.  Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations. 
 
 Applicant is a 53-year-old man employed by a Department of Defense contractor 
seeking a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since April 6, 
2009. He is a high school graduate. This is his first time applying for a security 
clearance. He is married. He divorced his first wife in September 1997. He married his 
second wife in April 2006. He has four children ages 32, 21, 19 and 9. (Tr. 7-10, 64-65; 
Gov 1)   
 
Applicant’s security clearance background investigation revealed that he has the 
following delinquent accounts: a $73 medical account (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 5 at 1; Gov 6 at 
1; Gov 7 at 1); a $429 medical account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.b: Gov 5 at 2; 
Gov 7 at 1); a $4,586 credit card account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.c: Gov 4 at 7; 
Gov 5 at 1; Gov 7 at 2); a $3,614 student loan account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.d: 
Gov 4 at 5; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 2); a $4,674 student loan account placed 
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.e: Gov 4 at 5; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 7 at 2); and a $9,991 
student loan account placed for collection. (SOR ¶ 1.f: Gov 4 at 4) 
 
Additional delinquent debts include: a $125 cell phone account placed for 
collection (SOR ¶ 1.g); a $175 telephone account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.h: Gov 
4 at 7); a $270 telephone account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.i: Gov 4 at 7); and a 
$10,878 student loan account placed for collection. (SOR ¶ 1.j: Gov 4 at 8)  
 
In August 2004, Applicant purchased a house taking out a variable rate 
mortgage. Applicant’s mortgage payment increased to $1,300. He got behind on his 
non-mortgage debts. He rents out the first floor of his home for $750 a month, but was 
unable to keep up with the mortgage payment and pay his other expenses. His wife 
does not work outside the home. (Gov 2 at 3)  
 
From October 2008 to April 2009, Applicant was unemployed. He received $430 
a week in unemployment compensation when he was unemployed. (Tr. 63) He had no 
health insurance when he was unemployed. He incurred some medical expenses while 
he was unemployed, two of the medical accounts are alleged in the SOR. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
and 1.b) His current job provides health insurance. (Tr. 65-66)

The current status of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is: 
 
1.a. $73 medical account: Paid on June 5, 2010. (Tr. 30-31; AE A at 5, fourth 
money order on the page) 
 
1.b. $429 medical account: Paid. Settled on September 2, 2010. (Tr. 31, 35; AE 
L) 
 
1.c. $4,586 credit card account placed for collection: A law firm obtained a 
judgment on this account. Applicant satisfied the judgment on March 18, 2010. During 
the hearing, it was not clear that the law firm collecting on the debt was connected to 
the original creditor. After the hearing, Applicant provided a document that is located at 
AE M at 5 which clearly connects the law firm and the debt alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 
37 - 40; AE J; AE M at 5)   
 
1.d. $3,614 student loan account over 120 days past due: Applicant testified the 
loan was sent back to the Department of Education for collection. Credit reports dated 
April 21, 2009, March 26, 2010, May 14, 2010, and June 17, 2010, list this debt as 
having a zero balance with a notation that a claim was filed with the Government. 
Applicant claims the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is collecting the delinquent student 
loan accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. He pays $150 each month towards this 
account pursuant to a student loan rehabilitation program. The payments began in May 
2010. The credit reports dated March 26, 2010, May 14, 2010, and June 17, 2010 list 
only one student loan account with the Department of Education with the current 
balance of $12,000. The Department of Education now has this loan. (Tr. 43-44; Gov 4 
at 5; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2; and Gov 7 at 2; AE A at 3; AE F at 2; AE K) 
 
1.e. $4,674 student loan account placed for collection: Applicant testified the loan 
was sent back to the Department of Education for collection. Credit reports dated April 
21, 2009, March 26, 2010, May 14, 2010, and June 17, 2010, list this debt as having a 
zero balance with a notation that a claim was filed with the Government. Applicant 
claims the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f is collecting the delinquent student loan 
accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. He pays $150 each month towards this 
account pursuant to a student loan rehabilitation program. The payments began in May 
2010. The credit reports dated March 26, 2010, May 14, 2010, and June 17, 2010 list 
only one student loan account with the Department of Education with the current 
balance of $12,000. The Department of Education now has this loan. (Tr. 43-44; Gov 4 
at 5; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 2; and Gov 7 at 2; AE at 3; AE F at 2; AE K) 
 
1.f $9,991 student loan collection account: Applicant claims this debt is the same 
as the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, and 1.e. As of May 2010, he has been paying $150 
each month towards this debt. (Tr. 43-44, AE M at 2-4) 
 
1.g $125 cell phone account placed for collection: Paid. (Tr. 52; AE A at 5) 
 
4 
 
 
1.h $175 telephone account placed for collection: Applicant testified that his 
account was purchased by AT&T. Account paid on December 5, 2009. (Tr. 52-53; AE A 
at 5) 
 
1.i $270 telephone account placed for collection: Applicant testified that his 
account was purchased by AT&T. Account paid on December 19, 2009. (Tr. 52-53; AE 
A at 5) 
 
1.j $10,878 student loan account placed for collection: Applicant claims this 
account is the same as SOR ¶ 1.f.  However, he currently is making payments towards 
two different student loan accounts. He pays $70 twice a month towards this account. 
(Tr. 45-47; AE A at 4; AE B; AE M at 3-4) 
 
Applicant’s net monthly income is $3,385. This figure includes the $750 monthly 
rental income. His monthly expenses include mortgage $1,400, groceries $270, clothing 
$140, utilities $300, car payment $531, car insurance $260, life insurance $70, medical 
insurance $120, miscellaneous and gas $130. Applicant no longer pays child support. 
His total monthly expenses are $3,221.  This leaves him $164 each month in 
discretionary income. Applicant testified that if he is allowed to work overtime, he has 
$500 left over each month. If he does not work overtime, he has $300 left over each 
month. His wife finished school and is looking for a job. (Tr. 54-58)  
 
Applicant has no savings accounts. He has no open credit card accounts. He has 
not attended credit counseling. He does not have a budget. He is current on state and 
federal income taxes. (Tr. 60-62, 65)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered when 
determining an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
 
5 
 
 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security 
decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG & 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security 
concerns. I find AG &19(a) (an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG &19(c) 
(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply to Applicant’s case. Applicant 
encountered financial difficulties since August 2004, after purchasing a house with a 
variable interest rate mortgage. His mortgage payment subsequently increased and he 
has insufficient income to pay all of his bills. The SOR alleged ten delinquent accounts 
 
6 
 
 
totaling $34,815. Of that amount, $29,157 consisted of delinquent student loan 
accounts. Several of the student loans were duplicates of each other.  
 
The Government’s substantial evidence and Applicant’s own admissions raise 
security concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive 
¶E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden 
of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially 
apply:  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. 
Applicant has had financial problems for the past six years. While Applicant recently 
resolved all of his consumer accounts, he is in the process of rehabilitating his student 
loans. Considering Applicant began to resolve his delinquent accounts over the past 
year, it is too soon to conclude that the behavior happened long ago.  Applicant’s past 
financial history raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.  
 
 AG & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual 
acted responsibly under the circumstances) partially applies. Applicant’s recent period 
of unemployment contributed to his financial problems. However, his decision to 
purchase a house with an adjustable rate mortgage was within his control. Once 
Applicant was hired in his current position, he began to focus on paying off his 
delinquent accounts. He has acted responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control) 
applies. Applicant has not received financial counseling. He is encouraged to take a 
course or read books on how to manage a budget and finances in order to prevent 
future financial problems. However, there are clear indications that his financial 
problems are being resolved. He resolved six of the debts. The remaining accounts are 
student loan accounts. SOR ¶¶1.d and 1.e are duplicates of SOR ¶ 1.f. There is 
substantial evidence to conclude that Applicant has two student loan accounts, both of 
which he has been making payments towards over the past several months. There are 
clear indications the problem is being resolved. He has a good job that provides health 
insurance. He is capable of meeting his monthly financial obligations. His finances are 
likely to improve once his wife finds employment.  
 
 
7 
 
 
AG & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to resolve his 
delinquent debts. He resolved the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.g, 1.h, and 
1.i. He presented sufficient evidence to conclude the student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.d and 1.e were transferred to the student loan account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f. It has 
been transferred to another collection agency collecting on behalf of the Department of 
Education. Applicant has two student loan accounts that he is making payments 
towards each month under a rehabilitation program. Applicant made a good-faith effort 
to resolve his delinquent accounts.   
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
        
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant has not always 
made the best financial decisions in the past, I considered that his recent financial 
problems were caused by periods of unemployment and underemployment. I also 
considered that he resolved most of the delinquent accounts and is making regular 
payments towards his remaining and two largest debts, his student loan accounts. His 
financial situation is likely to improve when his wife finds employment. He mitigated the 
concerns raised under financial considerations.

Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a -1.j:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
