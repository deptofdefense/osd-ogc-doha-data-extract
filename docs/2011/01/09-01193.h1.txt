GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility to occupy an Information Systems Position designated ADP 
I/II/III (public trust position) is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 7, 2008, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted a 
Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P).1 On an unspecified date, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) furnished him a set of interrogatories 
pertaining to his financial situation. He responded to the interrogatories on May 26, 
2009.2 On another unspecified date, DOHA furnished him another set of interrogatories, 
this time pertaining to an unsworn declaration of an interview he had with an 
investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on June 3, 2008. He

responded to those interrogatories on May 26, 2009.3 On another unspecified date, 
DOHA furnished him another set of interrogatories, this time pertaining to his intentions 
regarding the possible filing of bankruptcy. He responded to those interrogatories on 
December 2, 2009.4 On May 7, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could 
not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for occupying an 
Information Systems Position designated ADP I/II/III to support a contract with the 
Department of Defense, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 7, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on June 7, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on July 6, 2010, and the case was assigned me 
on October 18, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 13, 2010, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on December 2, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, 10 Government exhibits (1-10) were admitted into evidence, 
without objection. Applicant testified, but offered no exhibits. The record remained open 
to afford Applicant the opportunity to supplement it. On December 23, 2010, and on 
January 7, 2011, he submitted a total of 4 documents that were marked as exhibits (A-
D) and admitted into evidence, without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
December 7, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations 
(¶1.a., and ¶¶ 1.d. through 1.h.) of the SOR. He denied the remaining factual allegations 
(¶¶ 1.b., 1.c., 1.i., and 1.j.) of the SOR. 
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to 
retain his eligibility for occupying an Information Systems Position designated ADP II5 to 
support a contract with the Department of Defense. He has no prior military service.6 A

June 1985 high school graduate,7 with some technical courses,8 he has worked in a 
variety of positions in a variety of locations in two different states. He was a senior 
system administrator for a large telecommunications company from October 2000 until 
July 2004; a self-employed information technology (IT) consultant from July 2004 until 
February 2006;9 and a ramp service agent and subsequently IT technical support for an 
airline from February 2006 until February 2008,10 before being hired by his current 
employer in May 2008.11  
 
He went through two periods of underemployment or unemployment. In 2004, he 
was laid off along with all of the employer’s employees before the company eventually 
went out of business.12 Although he attempted to make a living as a self-employed IT 
consultant, he was essentially unemployed from July 2004 until February 2006.13 His 
second period of unemployment was much shorter, and lasted about one month when 
the airline for which he was working in February 2008 entered bankruptcy and laid him 
off.14 Applicant estimated he earned less than $20,000 in 2004; not more than $30,000 
in 2005; and less than $40,000 in 2006.15 
 
Applicant was married in April 1989.16 They have five children, born in 1989, 
1991, 1992, 1995, and 1997, respectively.17 In February 2007, Applicant and his wife 
informally separated, in part, due to financial stress and her involvement with another 
individual.18 They have remained separated. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
There was nothing unusual about Applicant’s finances until July 2004, when 
Applicant was laid off.19 When the company eventually went out of business, all

pensions and contributions were lost.20 Although Applicant’s wife routinely handled the 
bills, within a few months they started to fall behind in the monthly payments; several 
accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. Reluctant to 
seek bankruptcy, his wife returned to the workforce, and Applicant borrowed $10,000 to 
save their house from foreclosure and to help with the delinquencies, but everything 
deteriorated.21 His wife always received correspondence from the creditors, and that 
situation has continued to the present time.22 Immediately upon separating, Applicant 
moved from the family residence and in with a friend. He later relocated to another state 
upon being hired by his current employer, and now resides with his mother to conserve 
money.23 
  
Commencing the first month following their separation, Applicant sent over 50% 
of his salary as a support payment to his wife.24 In August 2009, the court ordered him 
to pay her $2,549.19 in monthly child support, and $2,500.00 in monthly maintenance, 
for a total monthly obligation of $5,049.19.25 The order was forwarded to his employer 
to garnish his wages, and $2,330.40 is withheld each pay date.26
 
When Applicant and his wife separated, he made an oral arrangement with her 
regarding medical benefits for their children. He maintained those benefits, and she was 
to take care of any medical bills whenever the children need medical attention.27 
Additionally, upon receiving the financial interrogatories which listed his delinquent 
accounts,28 he approached her, and she indicated she was going to help and they 
would jointly seek discharge through bankruptcy.29 Since then, she apparently reversed 
course, and he was advised he would have to handle the problem by himself.30 
 
In May 2009, Applicant claimed he was “working toward paying [his] debt.”31 He 
also prepared a personal financial statement, indicating his monthly expenses, including

support and maintenance, and his telephone bill, totaled $2,480.32 In December 2009, 
he stated: “My plans are to get this completed myself. My ex was to do all of this and 
looks like she hasn’t. I will take control of this process and get the bankruptcy going. . . . 
I will take control and get this going at the first of the year.”33 On December 23, 2010, 
he prepared another personal financial statement indicating his monthly net salary as 
$2,921.02, his wife’s monthly net salary as $1,610.00, for a total monthly net income of 
$4,021.00, and monthly expenses, not including any debt repayment, of $2,625.00.34 
No delinquent accounts were listed. It appears that he personally has a net remainder 
available for discretionary spending, such as debt repayment, totaling $296.02. 
Nevertheless, Applicant contends he barely has enough money to give to his wife for 
the children, or “keep [his] head above water,” much less attempt to pay any delinquent 
bills.35 
 
The SOR identified 10 purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit 
reports from 2008,36 2009,37 and 2010,38 totaling approximately $96,529. Some 
accounts listed in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other 
creditors or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in these credit 
reports, in many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same 
creditor name or under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by 
complete account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in 
some instances eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. 
Some accounts reflect no account number.  
 
The delinquent accounts include a judgment in favor of a homeowner’s 
association, in the amount of $1,294.00 (SOR ¶ 1.a.), obtained after the separation;39 
four medical accounts totaling $750.00 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b., 1.c., 1.i., and 1.j.); a loan to 
minimize a potential foreclosure, now increased to $11,046.00 (SOR ¶ 1.g.); a 
foreclosed mortgage, in the amount of $81,761.00 (SOR ¶ 1.h.), also completed after 
the separation;40 and some other rather minor accounts.

spending. No delinquent accounts were listed.

Despite promises to file for bankruptcy, to date, Applicant has taken no action to 
see an attorney to commence bankruptcy proceedings.41 He does not believe he has 
sufficient funds, thought by him to be $1,100.00 to engage a bankruptcy attorney’s 
services.42 In addition, he has never approached his creditors to set up repayment 
arrangements, choosing instead to let his wife remain responsible for such 
communications. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”43 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. Positions designated as ADP I/II/III are classified as “sensitive 
positions.”44 “The standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is 
that, based on all available information, the person’s loyalty, reliability, and 
trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security.”45 Department of Defense contractor 
personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any 
final unfavorable access determination may be made.46  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a public trust 
position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision.

In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”47 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.48  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  
Furthermore, security clearance determinations, and by inference, public trust 
determinations, should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”49 In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences 
grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
47 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”

The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, there was nothing unusual about Applicant’s 
finances until about mid-2004, when he was laid off and was underemployed or 
unemployed until February 2006 before obtaining another job with a reduced salary. As 
noted above, Applicant estimated he earned less than $20,000 in 2004; not more than 
$30,000 in 2005; and less than $40,000 in 2006. With his marriage dissolving, his 
accounts becoming delinquent, and his income and credit deteriorating, Applicant and 
his wife separated, and he left the family residence. Since she had always taken care of 
their family finances, he let her continue doing so, despite their separation. He 
essentially divorced himself from the delinquent accounts, and satisfied himself by 
simply paying her child support and maintenance. With insufficient funds to pay the 
monthly payments, Applicant’s accounts fell deeper into delinquency, and the bank 
foreclosed on the family residence. He made no effort to contact his creditors to resolve 
his accounts, and has not filed for bankruptcy. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@50 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
 
50 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

AG ¶ 20(a) only minimally applies for while Applicant’s financial problems 
commenced in 2004 when he was laid off, to date, they remain unattended, Applicant’s 
handling of his finances, under the circumstances, casts doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Likewise, he receives partial application of AG ¶ 20(b), because the conditions 
that contributed to the financial problem were initially beyond Applicant’s control (e.g., 
loss of his employment in 2004, his continuing underemployment, and his separation). 
While he attempted to minimize his expenses, in essentially ignoring his delinquencies 
and continuing to allow his wife to be responsible for the handling of the accounts, 
Applicant failed to act responsibly under the circumstances.51  
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because there is no evidence that Applicant has ever 
received financial counseling or debt consolidation guidance. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply because Applicant failed to initiate any effort, much 
less a “good-faith effort,” to start repaying any of his creditors before the hearing. The 
two delinquent accounts with balances of $150.00, and the delinquent account with a 
$252.00 balance have been ignored. Applicant never contacted any of the creditors to 
try to make repayment arrangements. Over the years, Applicant did not act 
aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. Instead, he ignored 
his debts and continues to do so.  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant he has not provided documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of any disputed account. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
51 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case

(a)(9). 
                                                          
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. When these 
problems commenced with his being laid off in 2004, and continued through his 
unemployment and underemployment, his finances continued to go steadily out of 
control. His financial problems were exacerbated by his separation and the garnishment 
of a substantial portion of his wages. After a lengthy period of inaction during which he 
did not address his creditors, Applicant indicated he intends to file for bankruptcy.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the unemployment and reduced earnings were circumstances beyond his control, 
Applicant either had no ability or no intention to pay his delinquent accounts. He did not 
make any efforts to pay his creditors, generally ignoring them and relying on his wife to 
handle everything. His long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in reasonable 
amounts, or to arrange payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about his 
fitness to hold a security clearance.  
 
I am mindful that any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s 
credit history in a sympathetic light. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.52 The absence of any efforts or evidence to reflect actual payments to his 
SOR creditors are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:53 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
52 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as 
to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility to occupy an 
Information Systems Position designated ADP II to support a contract with the 
Department of Defense.  Eligibility for public trust position is denied.
