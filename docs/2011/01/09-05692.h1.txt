GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations.  Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 20, 2009, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) furnished her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the 
interrogatories on November 16, 2009.2 On April 8, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86), dated March 20, 2009.  
 
2 Government Exhibit 2 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated November 16, 2009).

(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (effective within the 
Department of Defense on September 1, 2006) (AG) for all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 15, 2010. In a written 
statement, notarized on May 14, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on July 8, 2010, and the case was assigned to 
me on August 4, 2010. A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 23, 2010, and I 
convened the hearing, as scheduled, on September 21, 2010. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1-5) were admitted into 
evidence, without objection. Applicant testified. The record remained open to afford 
Applicant the opportunity to supplement it, and on October 4, 2010, she submitted 
seven documents (AE A-G) that were admitted into evidence, without objection. The 
transcript (Tr.) was received on October 4, 2010. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations (¶¶ 
1.a. through 1.j.) of the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact.  
 
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as an 
accounting and administrative assistant,3 and she is seeking to obtain a security 
clearance.4 A June 1992 high school graduate through the General Educational 
Development (GED) program,5 with a year of additional credits at a community college 
and a university,6 she has worked in a variety of full-time and part-time, as well as 
seasonal, positions over the years.7 She has no prior military service.8 Applicant was 
3 Applicant Exhibit E (Position Description, dated September 13, 2010), which describes the position as 
accounting/administrative assistant; and Applicant Exhibit D (Performance Evaluation, signed by rater May 3, 2010), 
at 1, describing the position as accounting clerk. Applicant stated she was the administrative assistant and 
accounting assistant to the chief financial officer. Tr. at 38.

unemployed on three relatively brief occasions. She was initially laid off from a hospital 
supply company in April 2005, and was unemployed for about three weeks;9 from a 
pharmaceutical company in June 2007, and was unemployed for two to three weeks;10 
and she was an accounts payable utility billing specialist with a mortgage company from 
July 2007 until she was laid off in March 2009.11 She was unemployed for four weeks 
before being hired by her current employer in about April 2009.12 During her latest 
period of unemployment, Applicant received unemployment compensation for one 
week.13  
 
Applicant has never been married.14 She has two children, born in 1993 and 
1994, respectively.15 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant contends that there was nothing unusual about her finances until she 
was laid off in March 2009, and that she did not have any delinquencies, “that [she 
could] recall.”16 She stated that in anticipation of purchasing a residence in 2004, she 
made sure her finances were in order and paid off all of her credit card bills.17 Several 
accounts were reported as delinquent, placed for collection, or charged off, in 2007,18 
2008,19 and early 2009.20 When she was laid off in 2009, her mortgage had been 30 
days past due on six or more occasions.21 Her student loans were in collection.22

Applicant stated that immediately upon being laid off, she began contacting her 
creditors to inform them of her circumstances and attempted to set up repayment plans. 
She also requested a forbearance plan for her student loans.23 She had received no 
reply to her efforts as of July 2009.24 The forbearance request was subsequently 
disapproved.25 Applicant took no further action to contact her creditors until about 30 
days before the September 2010 hearing because “it was the first time that it looked like 
[she] may have the opportunity to start paying some of them off. The smaller ones at 
least.”26 She purportedly wrote letters to her creditors requesting payoff amounts, but 
did not try to negotiate any repayment plans.27 There is no documentary evidence to 
support Applicant’s contentions that she made any contacts with her creditors, either in 
2009 or in 2010. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not received any 
responses from her creditors.28  
 
For the past nine years, Applicant has also been employed in a seasonal 
capacity generally for six weeks, earning approximately $12.90 per hour. During a 60-
day period from October 12, 2009 until November 8, 2009, she earned $1,004.46 from 
that job.29 The job adds about $2,000 to her gross income over the course of a year.30 
Overall, in 2008, Applicant’s take home pay was $38,000, and in 2009 it was $22,000.31 
 
Applicant has never received any credit counseling or debt management 
counseling.32 At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had not developed a written 
financial plan or budget,33 but based on her estimate, she claimed to have $150 
available each month for discretionary spending.34 She subsequently submitted a 
written personal budget indicating a monthly gross income of $3,063, monthly expenses 
of $2,944,35 including taxes, home and daily living expenses, transportation, health, 
clothing, and retirement savings, leaving $119 available for discretionary spending.36

Because of current unconfirmed neurological medical issues, for the past six 
months, Applicant has been undergoing medical testing, and the tests and procedures 
required that she take annual leave, but they have not prevented her from working.37 No 
diagnosis has yet been made.38 Applicant claims that because of the expenses 
associated with her medical issues which were not covered by her health insurance, 
she has been unable to address her delinquent accounts.39 
 
The SOR identified ten purportedly continuing delinquencies as reflected by 
credit reports from 200940 and 201041 totaling approximately $33,850. Some accounts 
listed in the credit reports have been transferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors 
or collection agents. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in these credit reports, in 
many instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same creditor name 
or under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by complete account 
numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in some instances 
eliminating the last four digits and in others eliminating other digits. Some accounts 
reflect no account number.  
 
The delinquent accounts include two student loans totaling $28,654 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d. 
and 1.e.); one medical account in the amount of $171 (SOR ¶ 1.h.); several credit or 
charge cards, and some other accounts. Applicant informally “disputed” the gas utility 
account in the amount of $111 (SOR ¶ 1.a.) because there was no gas service at her 
residence.42 Nevertheless, Applicant said all of the debts listed in the SOR “should be 
valid,” with the possible exception one account in the amount of $245 (SOR ¶ 1.j.) which 
she believed to be a duplicate of another debt.43 She added: “I owe these bills. They are 
my bills. I will take care of them, they will be paid.”44  
 
Despite promises by Applicant to pay off the delinquent accounts, to date, she 
has not made any payments to the creditors.45 As to the accounts listed in the SOR, 
based on the evidence before me, I conclude that no payments have been made to any 
of the delinquent accounts.

Character References and Work Performance 
 
 Two of Applicant’s coworkers at her seasonal job (including one with whom she 
has maintained a personal relationship for two years) are familiar with her and 
characterize her in favorable terms. Applicant demonstrates ethics, reliability, and moral 
character, and is a hardworking person who is well respected.46 Her performance 
evaluation reflects an individual who is generally outstanding or commendable, and who 
needs to improve her morning tardiness and oral communications.47 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”48 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”49   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”50 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish

Reference, undated).

50 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
 
7 
                                      
 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.51  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to 
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, 
“security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”52 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”53 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially

overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. As noted above, Applicant contends that there was nothing unusual 
about her finances until she was laid off in March 2009, and that she did not have any 
delinquencies, that she could recall. Her contention is not supported by the evidence, 
for several accounts were reported as delinquent, placed for collection, or charged off, 
in 2007, 2008, and early 2009. When she was laid off in 2009, her mortgage had been 
30 days past due on six or more occasions, and her student loans were in collection. 
Although her periods of unemployment were relatively brief, she had insufficient funds 
to pay the monthly bills, Applicant’s accounts fell deeper into delinquency. The accounts 
remained delinquent and were placed for collection or charged off. They have remained 
in a delinquent status ever since because Applicant is addressing medical issues rather 
than financial ones. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply. 
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where “the conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.” Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@54 Also, AG ¶ 20(e) may apply where “the individual has a reasonable 
basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem 
and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue.”  
54 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

Applicant’s financial problems commenced sometime between 2007 and 2009, 
and have continued to the present day, although she joined her current employer in 
April 2009, over a year ago, and currently earns an annual salary of about $36,756. She 
has generally remained gainfully employed throughout the entire period, with brief 
periods of unemployment. Applicant has acknowledged limited effective resolution of 
her delinquent accounts. Her failure to timely handle her bills has exacerbated her 
financial meltdown. Because she has multiple delinquent debts and her financial 
problems are continuing in nature, she receives minimal application of AG ¶ 20(a). 
Applicant’s handling of her finances, under the circumstances, casts doubt on her 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Likewise, she receives partial application of AG ¶ 20(b), for while she may have 
been unemployed for relatively brief periods, and is undergoing medical testing to 
identify her medical condition, there is little evidence that Applicant was substantially 
affected by circumstances beyond her control. Applicant failed to act responsibly under 
the circumstances. She failed to resolve her debts and failed to reduce her 
delinquencies.55  
 
AG & 20(c) does not apply because Applicant has never received financial 
counseling or debt consolidation guidance from a credit counselor. 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply because, to date, Applicant made no proven effort to 
address her delinquent accounts. There is no documentary evidence to support 
Applicant’s contentions that she ever contacted any of those creditors to try to make 
repayment arrangements. Instead, she talked about doing so, and promised to do so, 
but there is no documentary evidence that any creditors had agreed with her proposed 
plan or that any payments had, in fact, been made. Over the years, Applicant did not act 
aggressively, timely, or responsibly to resolve her delinquent debts.  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply because Applicant has not provided documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of any disputed account. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
55 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 
99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. She 
experienced several relatively brief periods of unemployment and has continuing health 
issues. After a lengthy period of inaction during which she did not address her creditors, 
according to Applicant, she initiated some efforts to address her accounts. After the 
hearing, she also prepared her written budget. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
While the brief unemployment and reduced earnings were circumstances beyond her 
control, Applicant either had no ability or no intention to pay her delinquent accounts. 
She did not make any payments to her creditors. Despite the passage of time, there is 
no documentation to support her contentions that she had contacted her creditors. Her 
long-standing failure to repay creditors, at least in reasonable amounts, or to arrange 
payment plans, reflects traits which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security 
clearance.  
 
I am mindful that any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant’s 
credit history in a sympathetic light. I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in 
light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal 
analysis.56 Her insufficient good-faith efforts or documentary evidence to reflect actual 
payments to her SOR creditors are sufficient to raise continuing security concerns. See 
AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:57 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “‘meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an 
56 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

applicant demonstrate that he [or she] has “ . . . established a plan to 
resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan.” The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of 
an applicant’s financial situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the 
extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding 
indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶  E2.2(a) (“Available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.”) There is 
no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
Although there are some positive signs, such as Applicant’s descriptions of 
proposed efforts to take corrective actions, and maintenance of accounts on her current 
daily living expenses, these steps are simply insufficient to show she can live within her 
means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations. Overall, the record evidence 
leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed 
to mitigate the security concerns arising from her financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
