HEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant had four tax liens and nine other delinquent accounts totaling 
approximately $26,000. During the last year, she has documented paying less than 
$1,000 on these accounts. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the security 
concerns under financial considerations. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DoD) intent to deny or revoke 
her eligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive 
Order and DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
 
1 
 
                                                          
1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) effective within the DoD on September 1, 2006.

a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 7, 2010, detailing security concerns under 
financial considerations. 
  
 Applicant in her undated SOR answer elected to have the matter decided without 
a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government's case in a File of Relevant 
Material (FORM), dated November 15, 2010. The FORM contained seven attachments 
(Items). On November 23, 2010, Applicant received a copy of the FORM, along with 
notice of her opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or 
mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  
 
On November 30, 2010, Applicant responded to the FORM. Department Counsel 
did not object to the material. Applicant's response was admitted into the record. On 
January 6, 2010, I was assigned the case.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, she denied the debts listed in ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 
1. j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m of the SOR. She admitted owing the two Federal tax liens, ¶¶ 1.a 
and 1.c; the two state tax liens, ¶¶ 1.b and 1.e; and two additional debts, ¶¶ 1.d and 1.i, 
of the SOR. She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility 
for a security clearance. I incorporate Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations. 
After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following 
findings of fact: 
 
 Applicant is a 42-year-old engineer who has worked for a defense contractor 
since December 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant was 
unemployed for two months from April 2007 through June 2007, three months from July 
2006 through October 2006, and three months from December 2005 through February 
2006. 
 
 Two federal and two state tax liens were incurred because Applicant’s husband 
was doing work and insufficient taxes were withheld from his pay to cover the income 
tax. In the summer of 2009, Applicant asserted she began making $100 monthly 
payments to the state and $300 monthly to the federal government. Applicant and her 
husband have changed the number of withholding they claim on their W-2, thereby 
allowing more taxes to be taken from their pay. (Item 5)  
 
In December 2009, Applicant was interviewed about her finances. She did not 
dispute the $1,334 and $1,802 state tax liens or the $6,973 federal tax lien. At that time, 
she believed the state liens would be paid by December 2012 and the federal liens by 
December 2013. In early 2009, Applicant’s wages were garnished in the amount of 
$384 for a tax lien. (Item 5) Applicant did not know the nature of the lien. (Item 5) In May 
2009, the state levied on Applicant’s wages to recover $2,066 owed for tax year 2005. 
(SOR Answer)  
 
 
3 
 
In May 2009, the state issued a Notice of Levy on Wages, Salary. Applicant 
owed $2,066 for state income tax for tax year 2005. (SOR Answer Item 3) An October 
14, 2010 update indicated Applicant owed state income tax of $1,252. (SOR Answer 
Item 3) The form lists a tax due date of April 15, 2009, but does not list the tax year for 
this tax debt. The record contains no additional information showing payment by 
Applicant.  
 
 Applicant admitted the October 2008 Federal Tax Lien of $6,973 (¶ 1.c) and the 
December 2009 Federal Tax Lien of $5,214 (¶ 1.a). The two amounts total $12,187. On 
April 23, 2010, Applicant made a $150 payment to the U.S. Treasury. (Item 5) For the 
tax period ending December 31, 2009, Applicant owed $4,430.50 for income tax. (Item 
5) In her SOR Answer (Item 3), Applicant submitted a September 2010 letter from the 
IRS indicating she and her husband owed the following amounts: $4,035 for tax year 
2005, which included a $150 payment; $3,682 for tax year 2006; $2,384 for tax year 
2008; and $4,532 for tax year 2009. The four years total $14,634. The form indicated 
Applicant’s next payment of $265 was due on September 28, 2010. (Item 3)  
 
 At the time of her December 2009 interview, Applicant did not dispute owing a 
credit collection service for two separate accounts. The collection service was 
attempting to collect two debts; a $1,289 credit card debt (¶ 1.f, $578) and a vehicle 
repossession debt of $8,204 (¶ 1.d, $9,133). (Item 6) The vehicle was repossessed 
following a two-month period of unemployment in 2007. (Item 4, 5) Applicant made $50 
monthly payment on the first debt and, in May 2010, Applicant paid $255 to settle the 
debt. (SOR Answer) 
 
 As to the second debt, the creditor offered to settle the account for an amount 
Applicant was unable to pay. The account was transferred to a new collection agency. 
(Item 5) During the December 2009 interview, Applicant asserts the creditor agreed to 
accept $100 monthly payments. On July 26, 2010, the SOR creditor sent Applicant a 
letter reminding her that her account would be debited $100 on July 30, 2010. The 
balance due as of July 26, 2010 was $9,133. Between December 2009 and July 2010, 
the amount due on the account had increased by $929. As of September 20, 2010, the 
balance owed was $8,943. (SOR Answer) This indicates $100 payments were made in 
July 2010 and August 2010. In her November 2010 FORM Answer, she asserts this 
debt will be paid in full by the end of December 2010. There is no evidence of payments 
on this debt other than the two $100 payments.  
 
 As of 2010, Applicant and her husband’s monthly income was $4,300. Their 
monthly expenses were $2,052, and their net monthly remainder was $1,383. She had 
$8,000 in her 401(k) retirement plan. (Item 5) In November 2010, they made the final 
payment on their 2000 Dodge. (FORM Answer)  
 
 The FORM page 6 informed Applicant she had provided insufficient 
documentation to evidence the current status of her debts. Her FORM Answer asserts 
she is still making payments to the IRS, but provided no documentation establishing the 
amount she has paid to the IRS or the state tax authority. She asserts she will continue 
 
4 
 
making $100 payments on the vehicle repossession debt and asserts that debt will be 
paid in full by the end of December 2010. Again, she provided no documentation as to 
how much she had paid the creditor or when.

obligations and their current status follows:

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
6 
 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
  
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of 
the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Adjudicative Guideline (AG) ¶ 18 articulates the security concerns relating to 
financial problems: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
7 
 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified 
information. Behavior in one aspect of life provides an indication of how a person may 
behave in other aspects of life.  
 
A person’s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is 
uncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent 
substantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a 
history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is 
inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt 
free, but is required to manage her finances to meet her financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems. The SOR alleges 13 tax liens and 
debts placed for collection totaling in excess of $26,000. Those debts included taxes 
owed the IRS and state taxing authority, and owed as the result of vehicle 
repossession. The evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a), 
“inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts” and AG ¶19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” apply.  
 
 Five Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG ¶¶20 are 
potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 
8 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
The mitigating conditions listed in AG ¶ 20(a) do not apply. The tax liens and 
repossession were incurred a number of years ago, but remain unpaid. Between 
December 2005 and June 2007, Applicant was unemployed for eight months, which is a 
factor beyond her control. However, the mitigating conditions listed in AG ¶ 20(b) have 
limited applicability because Applicant has been employed since July 2007. The 
mitigating conditions in AG ¶ 20(c) do not apply, because there is no evidence Applicant 
received financial counseling or that her financial problems are under control.  
 
The mitigating conditions in AG ¶ 20(d) have limited applicability. Applicant paid 
the debts listed in & 1.f ($578), & 1.g ($98), & 1.j ($40), & 1.k ($35), & 1.l ($372), and & 
1.m ($192). She provided documentation establishing that she is making payments on & 
1.i ($593), which as of October 2010 had a balance of $379. I find for her as to these 
debts. AG ¶ 20(d) applies to these debts she has paid. AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply to the 
remaining debts.  
 
The record evidence establishes the vehicle repossession debt (¶ 1.d, $9,133) 
has been reduced to $8,943 as of September 2010. Since being questioned about this 
debt in December 2009 she has made two payments of $100 each. She asserted, but 
failed to document, that she was making $100 monthly payments on this debt. She has 
failed to document a good-faith effort to repay this debt. In December 2009, Applicant 
owed the IRS approximately $13,000. As of September 2010, she owed approximately 
$14,600. She asserted, but failed to document, she was making monthly payments on 
this debt. As of December 2009, she had two state tax liens totaling approximately 
$3,000. As of October 2010, she owed at least $1,252 for tax year 2005. She again 
asserted, but failed to document, she was making monthly payments on this debt.  
 
The FORM clearly informed Applicant she had provided insufficient 
documentation to evidence the current status of her debts. In her FORM response, she 
provided documentation that her 2000 Dodge had been paid off ahead of schedule and 
the $98 medical debt (¶ 1.g) was being removed from her CBR. No documentation as to 
the tax liens or the vehicle repossession debt was received. Applicant has failed to 
sufficiently document a good-faith effort to address her debts.  
 
The mitigating factors in AG &20(e) do not apply to the taxes owed or the 
repossession debt. Applicant did dispute a number of the SOR debts and I have 
previously found for her on the debts she paid, but had earlier disputed.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
 
9 
 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Since being questioned about her 
finances in December 2009, Applicant has documented payment of approximately $900 
on the debts totaling $26,000. She asserted, but failed to sufficiently document, that she 
made additional monthly payments. The issue is not simply whether all her debts are 
paid—it is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold 
a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) In the past year, she has made insufficient 
progress in addressing the financial concerns.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant did not fully mitigate the security concerns arising from financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a ─1.e:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f and 1.g:  For Applicant     
  Subparagraph 1.h:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i ─1.m:  For Applicant 
 
 
 
 
  
 
10 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
