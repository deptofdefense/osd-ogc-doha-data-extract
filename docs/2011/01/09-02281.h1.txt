FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 11, 2008. 
On May 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her 
application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on May 25, 2010; answered it on June 30, 2010; and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on July 
2, 2010. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 19, 2010, and the case was 
 
2 
 
 
assigned to an administrative judge on July 23, 2010. It was reassigned to me on 
August 3, 2010, based on workload considerations. 
 
After coordinating with Applicant’s counsel, DOHA issued a notice of hearing on 
September 1, 2010, scheduling it for September 29, 2010. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of three witnesses, and submitted 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through EE, which were admitted without objection. 
Applicant’s counsel submitted a memorandum of law, marked as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. 
Department Counsel submitted a demonstrative exhibit summarizing the evidence, 
marked as HX II. Applicant’s counsel submitted two demonstrative exhibits, marked as 
HX III and IV.1 DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 7, 2010. 
 
Government Motion to Reopen the Record 
and Amend the Statement of Reasons 
 
 On October 20, 2010, Department Counsel filed a motion for leave to submit 
additional documentary evidence, amend the SOR to add an allegation that Applicant 
testified falsely at her hearing, and reopen the hearing to address the additional 
allegation of testifying falsely. (Hearing Exhibit (HX) V.) On the same day, I ordered 
Applicant’s counsel to respond to Department Counsel’s motion by October 30, 2010. 
(HX VI.) 
 
 Applicant’s counsel responded on October 22, 2010, opposing Department 
Counsel’s motion. (HX VII.) On October 25, 2010, Department Counsel submitted 
evidence in support of her motion. (HX VIII). On October 26, 2010, Applicant’s counsel 
responded to Department’s Counsel’s evidentiary submission. (HX IX.) On November 2, 
2010, I denied the motion. My order states, “The factual and legal basis for this ruling 
will be set out in the decision on the original Statement of Reasons.” (HX X.) 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant was asked by Department Counsel if she had been 
questioned by another agency in 2007 about her finances, and she responded, “Yes.” 
She was asked if she was aware of a judgment obtained against her by a law firm 
before she was interviewed, and she responded, “I don’t believe I was.” She was asked 
if the agency made her aware of it and she responded, “No; not that I recall.” She was 
asked again if they asked her about the judgment and again she responded, “Not that I 
recall.” She was then asked if she discussed the judgment with a Department of 
Defense investigator in October 2008, and she responded, “I don’t recall.” (Tr. 127-29.)  
 
The evidence proffered by Department Counsel in support of her motion reflects 
that Applicant was questioned by the other agency in January 2008 about the judgment. 
The security investigation by the other agency was terminated without a clearance 
decision when contract between the agency and Applicant’s then employer ended. (Tr. 
126-29; HX IV at 11.) 
                                                          
1 HX III and IV were originally marked as AX Y and Z. AX AA through EE were not relabeled. Thus, there 
are no exhibits marked as AX Y and Z. 
 
3 
 
 
Applicant’s credit reports reflect a judgment for $19,713 against her obtained by 
a law firm in February 2006. (GX 2 at 1; GX 3 at 4.) When she was interviewed by a 
security investigator in October 2008, she acknowledged that she was trying to settle a 
“civil court case” with the law firm, but the interview summary does not reflect whether 
she knew that the law firm had obtained a judgment against her. (GX 5 at 8.) 
 
 Directive ¶ E3.1.10 provides, “The Administrative Judge may rule on questions 
o[f] procedure, discovery, and evidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, 
timely, and orderly manner.” Directive ¶ E3.1.17 provides, “The SOR may be amended 
at the hearing by the Administrative Judge on his or her own motion, or upon motion by 
Department Counsel or the applicant, so as to render it in conformity with the evidence 
admitted or for other good cause.” Department Counsel’s motion to amend the SOR 
was not made “at the hearing,” and it does not seek to conform any of the SOR 
allegations to the evidence. Instead, it seeks to add a new allegation not encompassed 
by any of the original allegations. Thus, Department Counsel had the burden of showing 
“other good cause.” 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.36, an administrative judge’s clearance decision is final 
when no timely notice of appeal is filed, no timely appeal brief is filed after a notice of 
appeal has been filed, the appeal has been withdrawn, or when the Appeal Board 
affirms or reverses the clearance decision. The Directive is silent on an administrative 
judge’s authority to keep the record open, although Directive ¶ E3.1.8 expressly grants 
authority to grant continuances. Keeping the record open is the equivalent of a 
continuance for a limited purpose. 
 
 The Directive also is silent regarding an administrative judge’s authority to 
reopen a hearing when neither party requested that the record be kept open. The 
Directive ¶ E3.1.29 expressly provides that when the Appeal Board receives a notice of 
appeal, “No new evidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board.” There 
is no express prohibition in the record against an administrative judge receiving 
additional evidence after the record has closed. In federal administrative practice, there 
is some authority indicating that an administrative judge has discretion to reopen the 
record before a decision becomes final. See 32 Fed. Proc., L. Ed. § 75:214 
(administrative law judge may reopen a Federal Trade Commission proceeding for 
reception of further evidence); American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration 
Rule 36 (federal arbitrator may reopen hearing at any time before award is made). In 
deciding Department Counsel’s motion, I concluded I had discretion to reopen the 
hearing for good cause, but I was not convinced that Department Counsel had 
demonstrated good cause, for the reasons set out below. 
 
 DOHA has an adequate remedy for false testimony. As Department Counsel 
conceded in her motion, DOHA has authority to issue another SOR alleging that 
Applicant testified falsely at her hearing.  
 
While credibility is always an important issue, the proffered evidence had limited 
probative value as impeachment evidence. Applicant testified that she did not 
 
4 
 
 
remember the other agency questioning her about the law firm’s judgment, but she has 
consistently admitted the facts on which the debt was based, disputed the amount of the 
debt, and made repeated offers to settle the debt for less than the full amount. At best, 
the proffered evidence might support a permissible inference that she lied about not 
remembering whether the other agency questioned her about the judgment. However, it 
does not directly contradict her testimony. Furthermore, it shows that she was candid 
and truthful during the other agency’s questioning.  
 
The focus of all the inquiries in this case was on the debt, not the fact that it was 
reduced to judgment. Applicant’s testimony at the hearing reflects only that she did not 
remember when she first learned that the debt had been reduced to a judgment. Proof 
that she learned about the judgment during another agency’s interview in January 2008 
would not have changed my evaluation of her credibility. After reviewing the transcript 
and documentary evidence, and considering Applicant’s candor and sincerity at the 
hearing, I was satisfied that my evaluation of her credibility and my weighing of the 
disqualifying and mitigating factors would not have been different if the proffered 
evidence had been presented at the hearing.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 
1.h, and denied the remaining allegations. Her admissions in her answer and at the 
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She was cleared for 
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) from 1988 until 1999. She has held a secret 
clearance since October 2008. (Tr. 84.) 
 
 Applicant graduated from college in September 1980 with a bachelor’s degree in 
political science and history. She obtained a master’s degree in political science in May 
1983, and received her doctorate in political science in July 1984. She was a university 
professor from 1984 to 1987. (Tr. 70.) She worked for a consulting firm from 1987 to 
1989.  
 
Applicant was the vice-president of a company working as a federal contractor 
from September 1989 to May 1999, earning about $115,000 per year. (Tr. 119.) She 
worked as a principal in a private firm from March 1999 to September 2002, earning 
about $200,000 per year. (Tr. 72.) She was unemployed from September 2002 to May 
2004, after the company downsized and eliminated her position. 
 
 Applicant began having financial problems after she lost her job in 2002. She 
lived off her savings for about six months. During 2003 and 2004, she borrowed about 
$80,000 from her parents. (AX J at 24.) She worked as a self-employed consultant from 
May to December 2004, earning about $3,000 per month.  
 
 
5 
 
 
Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in September 2004, because 
her house was about to be foreclosed and she hoped to gain some time to sell it. When 
she filed her bankruptcy petition, she was awaiting a decision on a job that would have 
provided her with monthly income of $15,166. She was not hired. (AX J at 20; Tr. 122.) 
Her bankruptcy petition was dismissed in February 2005 for failure to make the required 
payments. (Tr. 85.) Her bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. 
 
 Applicant testified she did not file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition because she 
“didn’t feel that it was right.” She believed she would be able to find employment and 
repay the debts. (Tr. 85.) 
 
 Applicant sold her home in March 2005, valued at about $750,000, after it had 
been on the market for about two years. She was able to pay off the first and second 
mortgages on the home, and had about $16,000 remaining, which she used for living 
expenses. She lived with her parents part of the time and in extended-stay hotels part of 
the time. (Tr. 74.)  
 
In addition to her consulting work, Applicant began working as a restaurant 
waitress in May 2005, earning $350 to $400 per week. (Tr. 76-77.) In August 2006, she 
began working for a former employer. She became a vice-president of her employer’s 
company in April 2007, earning about $60,000 per year. Her annual pay increased to 
about $90,000 in 2008, and it increased again in February 2009 to about $176,000. She 
paid off several small bills in 2008, and in February 2009 she started contacting the 
creditors for her larger debts. Her pay was cut in half in March 2010 because of a 
business downturn. In August 2010, she began a new job with another federal 
contractor, earning $188,000 per year. (Tr. 80-83.) 
 
Applicant divorced in August 1990, and she has a 24-year-old son whom she has 
supported through college. She received no child support from her son’s father. She has 
cohabited with her domestic partner since May 2003. Her partner suffered a stroke and 
is disabled. His only income is his disability payments of about $1,900 per month. (Tr. 
70.) 
 
 Applicant has paid or settled all the debts alleged in the SOR, except for the 
judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. The evidence concerning each of the debts is 
summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a (unsatisfied judgment for $19,713). The judgment was based on a 
dishonored check. Applicant’s domestic partner engaged a law firm to assist him, and 
needed to pay the firm $15,000 to continue working on his case. Applicant gave the firm 
a $15,000 check, even though she had insufficient funds to pay it. She asked the firm to 
hold the check, but the firm deposited it, and it was dishonored. The record does not 
reflect the date of the check. Based on the evidence of record, I conclude that the check 
was uttered sometime after Applicant began her relationship with her domestic partner 
in May 2003, and probably was after September 2004, the date of her bankruptcy 
petition, because the law firm was not listed as a creditor in her bankruptcy petition. (AX 
 
6 
 
 
J at 15-17.) When Applicant did not redeem the check, the law firm obtained a judgment 
against her in February 2006 for $19,713, representing the $15,000 plus interest of 
$3,558 and costs of $1,155.  
 
Applicant testified that she was unaware of the judgment until the background 
investigation regarding her security clearance. At the hearing, her attorney asked her if 
her first knowledge of the judgment was when she received the information from DOHA, 
and she responded, “I believe so; yes.” (Tr. 89.) During a security interview in October 
2008, she acknowledged that she owed the law firm for the dishonored check, and she 
told the investigator she was working with the law firm to settle it. (GX 5 at 8.) In 
response to DOHA interrogatories in June 2009, she stated that she had retained an 
attorney and was currently in settlement negotiations. (GX 5 at 5.) 
 
 In mid-March 2010, Applicant contacted the law firm and offered to settle the 
debt for 50% of the amount due, with an initial payment of $1,000, followed by monthly 
payments of $250 until the balance is paid. After an exchange of emails, her offer was 
rejected in late March 2010. (AX A.) Applicant authorized her attorney to offer a cash 
payment of $10,000, but her attorney advised her on August 24, 2010, that this offer 
also was rejected. (AX B.) On August 31, 2010, Applicant sent the firm a money order 
for $1,000 and promised to send $250 per month until the judgment is paid. (AX C.) As 
of the date of the hearing, she had received no response to the money order or the 
payment offer. (Tr. 93.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b ($30,342 credit card account). Applicant used this credit card to pay 
her son’s college tuition of about $15,000. The debt rose to more than $30,000 because 
of interest and fees. In May 2009, Applicant began making payments of $500 on this 
account. She reduced her payments to $50 for October, November, and December 
2009, but resumed the $500 payments from January to May 2010. (GX 6 at 1, 7-14; AX 
F.) In June 2010, the creditor accepted an offer to settle the debt for $6,998.44. (AX D.) 
In July 2010, the creditor acknowledged receipt of the settlement amount. (AX F.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c ($26,724 credit card account). Applicant disputed this debt, 
contending that it was a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.b. She testified that she contacted the 
creditor, but the creditor was unable to locate the account. Applicant’s credit report 
dated September 24, 2010, does not list any delinquent debts to this creditor. (AX EE.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d ($31,050 credit card account). Applicant used this credit card for 
living expenses while she was unemployed. She made two monthly $1,888 payments in 
April and May 2009. She then made monthly $400 payments in June, July, and August 
2009; $50 payments in September, October, November, and December 2009; $400 
payments in January, February, and March 2010; $200 in April 2010; and $100 in May 
2010. In June 2010, she settled the debt for $6,150. (GX 4 at 7; GX 6 at 11-14; AX DD; 
AXG, H, and I.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f ($59,396 credit card account). Applicant used this credit card 
account to consolidate other debts at zero percent interest for a limited time. (Tr. 130.) 
 
7 
 
 
In April 2009, she began making monthly $250 payments on this credit card account. 
She stopped making the payments in February 2010 and began negotiating a 
settlement. (Tr. 109.) In June 2010, she received a settlement offer of $13,509, payable 
in two installments. (AX K.) In August 2010, the debt was settled. (AX L, M.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g ($3,522 for auto lease). This debt was the balance due at the end of 
a car lease. (GX 3 at 13.) She turned in a leased car in early 2003. At the hearing, she 
could not remember if the amount due was for missed lease payments, excess mileage, 
or both. (Tr. 144.) The debt was included in Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and the 
original creditor did not pursue any collection action. (Tr. 112.) After Applicant contacted 
the original creditor, she was able to settle the debt for $2,289. (AX N.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h ($14,000 credit card account). Applicant made monthly $100 
payments on this debt from November 2009 through June 2010. (AX O.) In June 2010, 
she settled the debt for $7,500, payable in three $2,500 installments. The third and final 
installment was paid in September 2010. (AX O.)  
 
 Applicant also presented evidence that she resolved numerous debts that 
became delinquent after she lost her job in 2002 but were not alleged in the SOR. 
Several of the delinquent debts were with high-end department stores, and one was for 
the purchase of a grand piano. The evidence concerning these debts is summarized in 
the table below.

 Applicant submitted a personal financial statement to DOHA in May 2009, 
reflecting net monthly income of $14,319, expenses of $9,330, debt payments of 
$4,186, and a net remainder of $803. Her net income in May 2009 included about 
$4,000 in consulting fees from a former employer. (GX 4 at 23.)  
 
At the hearing, Applicant testified that her net monthly income was about $9,600, 
because she had not received any additional consulting work from her former employer. 
She will receive about $125 per hour for any future work as a self-employed consultant. 
Her former employer testified that she is still “on board” as an independent consultant 
for future projects. (Tr. 35-36.) Her expenses have increased by about $800 per month 
because she is paying her son’s student loans. Her total monthly expenses are $9,000-
 
8 
 
 
$10,000 per month. She has no savings or investments. (Tr. 131-36.) In her current job, 
Applicant participates in a 401(k) program, and her employer pays for health, dental, 
life, and long-term care insurance. (Tr. 54.) 
 
Applicant has two cars. When her father died in 2008, she took over the lease on 
her father’s car, because her father had died in the car and her mother did not want to 
keep it. The record does not reflect when the lease on her father’s car will expire. She 
leased a new car this year because of the age and mileage of her old car. Her cars are 
sensible, practical, non-luxury cars. Her total expenses for both cars are about $1,500 
per month. (Tr. 133-34.) 
 
Applicant is currently not repaying the $80,000 loan that her mother gave her 
when she was unemployed. Her mother has told her to repay the loan when she can, 
and if the loan is not repaid it will come out of her inheritance. (Tr. 141-42.) She owes 
her lawyer $2,000-$3,000, but apparently is not being pressured to pay it. (Tr. 136-37.) 
 
The president of the company that was Applicant’s former employer completed a 
28-year career in the intelligence community, has worked as a contractor in the field of 
intelligence analysis for eight years, and has known Applicant professionally and 
socially since his former employment in the intelligence community. He testified that her 
performance was “excellent” and “extremely solid” while working for him as a program 
manager. When business slowed down, he waived his agreement with another federal 
contractor to not hire from each other, and encouraged her to accept another job where 
her skills could be better utilized. (Tr. 34-36.) He testified that Applicant is careful about 
expenses and lives within her means. She has “a good sense of what she can do, what 
she can afford.” (Tr. 41.) He testified he has no hesitation in recommending Applicant 
for a security clearance. (Tr. 38.)  
 
The founder and president of the company that currently employs Applicant has 
known her since the late 1980s. He testified that Applicant is one of the most effective 
employees he has ever had. He described her as a “solid citizen” who is hard working, 
determined, open, and frank. (Tr. 51.) He testified that Applicant is someone he trusts 
and respects, and he has no concerns about her ability to manage her personal 
finances. (Tr. 53.) 
 
One of Applicant’s former supervisors and colleagues retired from the 
intelligence community after 30 years of service before becoming a defense contractor 
about a year ago. He testified he supervised her work for another government agency 
and that she did a “great” job on a difficult and demanding project. After he retired, he 
was recruited by Applicant to work for her former employer. He took the job because he 
was impressed by her work and reputation. Her hallmark is integrity and skillful 
performance. He recommended that she be granted a clearance because of her loyalty, 
integrity, and “right moral compass.” (Tr. 60-64.)   
 
A colleague, who has known Applicant since 2006, submitted a letter on her 
behalf, highly recommending that she be granted a security clearance, notwithstanding 
 
9 
 
 
her previous financial problems. The colleague described Applicant as “concise, timely, 
and extremely organized.” She also noted that Applicant was devoted to her son and 
family members. Applicant rented her colleague’s townhouse for three years and her 
rent payments were timely and the townhouse was “beautifully appointed.” (AX X.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in 
conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
10 
 
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 
U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
The DOHA Appeal Board may reverse an administrative judge’s “decision to 
grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to 
law.” ISCR Case No. 07-16511 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) (citing Directive ¶¶ 
E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.).2 The federal courts generally limit collateral attacks on 
agency decision appeals to deciding whether the agency complied with its own 
regulations.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
Several disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG ¶ 19(a) is 
raised by an “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.” AG ¶ 19(b) is a two-pronged 
condition that is raised by “indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending 
and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a 
realistic plan to pay the debt.” AG ¶ 19(c) is raised by “a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.” AG ¶ 19(d) is raised by “deceptive or illegal financial practices such as . . . 
check fraud. . . .” AG ¶ 19(e) is raised by “consistent spending beyond one=s means, 
which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.”  
 
Applicant’s history of financial delinquencies establishes AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c). AG 
¶ 19(b) is not established because there is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible 
spending and significant evidence of willingness to pay her debts. She held charge 
accounts at high-end department stores, owned an expensive home, and purchased an 
expensive grand piano, but she was earning $200,000 per year at the time. AG ¶ 19(d)

is raised by the evidence of the bad check for $15,000 uttered to the law firm. The 
evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding her utterance of the bad check is 
sparse, but sufficient to meet the relatively low standard of “more than a scintilla but less 
than a preponderance.” AG ¶ 19(e) is established because Applicant spent more than 
she earned during her periods of unemployment and underemployment.  
 
Since the Government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), (c), (d), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce 
evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An 
applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving 
it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 
2005).   
 
Several mitigating conditions are relevant to this case. Security concerns based 
on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that “the behavior happened so long 
ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive 
prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be established by showing the conduct was 
“so long ago,” or “so infrequent,” or “occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur.” If any of the three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating 
condition is not fully established unless the conduct “does not cast doubt on the 
individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” 
 
Although Applicant demonstrated poor judgment by uttering the dishonored 
check that was the basis for the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, her conduct was an 
isolated incident that happened at least five years ago when her life was in turmoil. 
However, the totality of the evidence regarding her financial situation precludes full 
application of AG ¶ 20(a), because she incurred numerous delinquent debts, several 
were resolved only recently, and the debt arising from her poor judgment in uttering the 
bad check remains unresolved. Her debts were not incurred under circumstances 
making them unlikely to recur, because her employment history demonstrates that she 
works in an environment where downsizing and income reductions occur during 
business downturns.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s 
control and responsible conduct, must be established.  
 
Applicant’s financial problems were the result of a business downturn that 
caused her to be unemployed and underemployed for about 20 months. She reacted 
responsibly by seeking other employment, borrowing money from her parents, selling 
her home, and living with her parents to save money. She paid off a $23,000 bank loan 
 
12 
 
 
in December 2004 and her home mortgages in 2005. She paid off several small debts in 
early 2008. She began contacting the creditors for her large debts in February 2009. 
Although the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has not been resolved, she “is not required to 
be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously.” She is only required to “act responsibly given [her] circumstances and 
develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by ‘concomitant conduct.’” 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009), citing IsCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has a reasonable plan to pay her only 
remaining delinquent debt, and she has taken significant steps to execute it.  I conclude 
that AG ¶ 20(b) is established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). This 
mitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive. If 
the person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear 
indications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has 
not received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or under control. There is no evidence 
that Applicant has sought or received financial counseling, but the second prong of AG 
¶ 20(c) is established by the substantial progress she has made in eliminating her 
delinquent debts and the steps she has taken to resolve her only remaining delinquent 
debt.  
 
 Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  
 
 An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every 
debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial 
problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement 
that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
 Applicant began resolving her delinquent debts in December 2004. She paid off 
her home mortgages in 2005. She paid several debts in early 2008. She has now has 
resolved all but one of the debts alleged in the SOR and numerous debts not alleged. 
She has attempted to negotiate a settlement or payment plan on the debt alleged in 
SOR ¶ 1.a, without success. Even without a formal agreement with the creditor, she has 
made a $1,000 payment on this debt and promised to pay $250 per month until it is 
paid.  
 
 
13 
 
 
 While Applicant arguably could have contacted some of the creditors sooner than 
February 2009, her overall approach has been carefully planned, persistent, and in 
good faith. She has resolved all her delinquent debts except one, and she has 
established a plan and taken significant steps to resolve the one remaining debt. I 
conclude AG ¶ 20(d) is established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). Applicant 
has tried to negotiate a reduction in the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, but she has not 
disputed the underlying debt created by her dishonored $15,000 check. I conclude AG ¶ 
20(e) is not established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is mature, well-educated, intelligent, and highly respected by superiors 
and her colleagues. She was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. She has held 
clearances for many years and provided outstanding service to various clients in the 
intelligence community. She has raised a son without financial help from the son’s 
father. Several career public servants with long experience in the national security 
arena provided glowing testimony about her character and integrity.  
 
 Applicant is still on the financial margin. However, she has displayed great 
resilience in responding to her financial problems. She is living a modest lifestyle. Her 
financial situation is likely to improve, because her son is an adult, eventually the lease 
 
14 
 
 
on her father’s car will end, and she is likely to have opportunities to supplement her 
income as a self-employed consultant. Her mother is providing a financial safety net. 
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
