NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for a 
security clearance to work in the defense industry. Because of three extended periods 
of unemployment, Applicant experienced financial problems beyond his control. He has 
demonstrated a willingness to fulfill his legal obligations to his creditors and has 
established a track record of repayment. He has also demonstrated concomitant 
conduct in support of his plan to file for bankruptcy protection. Clearance is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Acting under the relevant Executive Order (EO) and DoD Directive,1 on April  1, 
2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of 
                                                          
1 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this 
 
2 
 
Reasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to 
continue Applicant’s access to classified information. The SOR detailed the factual 
basis for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F (financial 
considerations).  
  
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. This case was initially 
assigned to another administrative judge. After Applicant requested and received two 
continuances in June and July 2011, the case was assigned to me on August 9, 2011. 
The hearing proceeded as scheduled on August 12, 2011. Department Counsel offered 
Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, which were admitted without objection. 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through C were also admitted without objection. I admitted 
as Hearing Exhibit (HE 1) a demonstrative exhibit prepared by Department Counsel.  
 
After the hearing, I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional 
documentation about his finances. He submitted one document, which I admitted as AE 
D without objection from Department Counsel. I received the transcript (Tr.) on August 
22, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a government contractor. Married 22 
years, he is the father of two college-age children, who live at home. The SOR alleges 
Applicant’s history of financial problems; specifically, that Applicant is indebted to eight 
creditors for $76,744 and that he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2004 and 
2007.2  
 
Applicant’s financial problems began in the late 1990s.  Between 1998 and 2009, 
Applicant experienced three lengthy periods of unemployment due to lay offs: 6 months 
between 1998 and 1999; 14 months between 2007 and 2008; and 14 months between 
2008 and 2009. His financial problems were exacerbated by his wife’s unemployment. 
With the exception of working part time for a few months in 2008, she has not worked 
full time since being laid off in 2006. Medical issues have prevented Applicant’s wife 
from re-entering the workforce. In July 2011, she was diagnosed with cancer.3 
 
During these periods of unemployment, Applicant depleted his savings to make 
ends meet. Between 2007 and 2009, he also worked as a consultant to generate 
additional income, but he did not earn enough to support his family. He attempted to 
resolve his delinquent debt through Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. Between 2000 
and 2007, Applicant filed for bankruptcy four times. In total, Applicant paid $243,558 to 
the bankruptcy trustee. His payments were distributed as indicated in the table below: 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
case. The AG were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). 
The AG replace the guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

In the 2001, 2004, and 2007 petitions, Applicant’s delinquent mortgage constituted 75% 
or more of the total claims allowed. Although Applicant made a significant number of 
payments under each bankruptcy plan, each petition was dismissed for cause — the 
last being dismissed with prejudice.4 
 
Applicant faults his attorney for the dismissal of his 2000, 2001, and 2004 
Chapter 13 petitions. He believes that the attorney failed to timely file documents 
requested by the trustee. He also believes that the attorney failed to remit Applicant’s 
payments to the trustee. Although Applicant suspected his attorney of malfeasance, he 
continued the representation reasoning that the lawyer was already familiar with his 
case and that retaining a different lawyer would be more expensive. Applicant admits 
that he allowed the 2007 petition to be dismissed so that he could obtain a mortgage 
modification. The lender refused to renegotiate the terms of Applicant’s mortgage as 
long as it was included in the bankruptcy petition. Once the bankruptcy was dismissed, 
Applicant obtained a mortgage modification and rehabilitated his delinquent mortgage, 
which is now current.5 
 
Applicant’s job as a program manager has caused him to become a geographical 
bachelor, living thousands of miles away from his family. For the last two years, he has 
paid the expenses of two households and his children’s college tuition on one income. 
He travels to his home state to visit his family only when his finances permit him to do 
so. A review of Applicant’s current credit reports indicates that he has not opened any 
new credit accounts nor has he accumulated any additional debt since he began his 
current employment. Even supporting two households, he is living within his means.6  
 
Specifically, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to eight creditors for 
approximately $76,000; of that amount $59,000 is his now-rehabilitated mortgage. 
Medical expenses incurred while Applicant and his wife were unemployed in 2007 
constitute approximately $1,800 of the alleged delinquent debt. Two of the debts, Castle 
Credit ($1,765) and Calvary Portfolio/ Chrysler Financial ($13,562) are older debts that

were included in all four of Applicant’s Chapter 13 petitions. These creditors received 
distributions totaling $7,700 from the trustee.7 
 
Applicant has retained a different attorney to help him through the bankruptcy 
process. At the time of the hearing, Applicant had an appointment scheduled with his 
attorney to determine whether his bankruptcy would proceed under Chapter 7 or 13. He 
has filed a bar complaint against the attorney who represented him in his four previous 
bankruptcy filings. He also plans to file a complaint with federal officials against the 
bankruptcy trustee that handled his Chapter 13 petitions.8 
 
Although Applicant does not currently hold a security clearance, he has done so 
in the past without incident. Initially, Applicant received access to classified information 
while serving in the Marine Corps from 1968 to 1977. He continued to hold a security 
clearance during his 20-year tenure with another government contractor. He believes 
that his security clearance lapsed between 2007 and 2008 when he was unemployed.9  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,

or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant has experienced financial problems that caused him to seek Chapter 13 
bankruptcy protection four times in less than 10 years. These facts are sufficient to 
warrant the application of the disqualifying conditions cited above. 
 
 Of the mitigating conditions available under AG ¶ 20, two are applicable to this 
case: 
 
6 
 
 (b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
and 
 (d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts. 
 Applicant’s financial problems were caused by events beyond his control, his and 
his wife’s 4.5 years of combined unemployment between 1999 and 2009. He chose to 
use Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection to resolve his delinquent debts. Over the course 
of approximately eight years, Applicant paid over $240,000 to the trustee, 80% of which 
was distributed to his secured creditors. Department Counsel argues that because all 
four of Applicant’s Chapter 13 petitions were dismissed, AG ¶ 20(b) cannot apply to this 
case. This argument is not persuasive. 
 
 Applicant used a legally legitimate method to manage his debt while coping with 
extended unemployment. The $240,000 in payments under his multiple Chapter 13 
bankruptcy petitions are too significant to be summarily dismissed. Applicant continued 
to make payments during his lengthy periods of unemployment between 2007 and 
2009. He also made payments as he financially supported two households on one 
income after he began working with his current employer in 2009. His actions 
demonstrate a willingness to fulfill his financial obligations and a positive track record of 
debt repayment. Applicant’s decision to pay his delinquent debts through Chapter 13 
was a reasonable method of engaging his multiple creditors, causing them to work 
toward the resolution of his delinquent debt in a way they may not have, if Applicant 
approached them individually.  
  
 Furthermore, the debts alleged in the SOR, as well as those declared in the four 
bankruptcy petitions, are not indicative of careless spending or irresponsible financial 
management. They are reasonable expenses associated with family life. Under the 
circumstances, Applicant handled his delinquent debts responsibly. Finding mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(b) is not an endorsement of Applicant’s decision to file multiple Chapter 
13 bankruptcy petitions, but recognition that Applicant’s motivation was toward the 
resolution of his debt and his decisions to that end were well-founded given his 
precarious financial situation. 
  
 The evidence also supports a finding that Applicant has acted in good faith to 
repay his delinquent debts. Through his bankruptcy petitions, Applicant’s secured 
creditors received over $216,000 in payments. Three of the eight creditors alleged in the 
SOR, Bank of America, Castle Credit, and Calvary Portfolio (Chrysler), received 
distributions from the trustee. Applicant has rehabilitated and is current on the largest 
delinquent debt alleged in the SOR – his Bank of America mortgage. Finally, he has 
retained a different bankruptcy attorney to advise him and ultimately guide him through 
the bankruptcy process most suited to his current circumstances. Given Applicant’s 
current situation, this decision is reasonable. Although the petition has not yet been 
 
7 
 
filed, Applicant has paid his attorney’s retainer fee, has his first meeting with the 
attorney scheduled, and has notified his creditors of the impending bankruptcy filing. 
 
 The Appeal Board has held that, “an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor 
to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. All that is 
required is that an applicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a 
reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct,” that is, actions 
which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.10 Applicant’s actions are more 
than a promise of remediation, but are concrete steps toward the resolution of his 
delinquent debt. As such, the unresolved nature of his finances is of limited security 
concern.  
 
Whole- Person Concept 
 
 Given the evidence in this case, I have no doubts or reservations about 
Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person 
factors at AG ¶ 2(a). For the past ten years, Applicant has leveraged his resources to 
the maximum. His efforts to financially support his family and repay his delinquent debt 
have come at a significant personal cost. For the past two years he has juggled these 
responsibilities while living thousands of miles away from his wife and his children. He 
continues to do so even though his wife is facing significant medical issues. Given 
Applicant’s history of debt repayment and evidence of his concomitant conduct towards 
the resolution of his debt through bankruptcy, I find that he has mitigated the security 
concerns raised in this case.  
 
Formal Findings

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
