Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of a 2001 Chapter
7 bankruptcy case and eight delinquent accounts for a total of about $19,000. Seven of
the eight debts remain unresolved, and Applicant does not have a realistic plan in place
to resolve them. Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to overcome the security
concerns stemming from his problematic financial history. Accordingly, as discussed
below, this case is decided against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on June 10, 2010,1
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar
to a complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was
assigned to me August 24, 2011. The hearing took place October 19, 2011. The
transcript (Tr.) was received October 27, 2011. 
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that ended in a discharge of debts in
2001, and eight delinquent accounts in amounts ranging from $31 to $15,177 for a total
of about $19,000. In Applicant’s reply to the SOR, his answers were mixed; he admitted
the bankruptcy; he admitted three debts; he denied three debts claiming he owed lesser
amounts; and he denied two debts claiming he paid them. His admissions are accepted
and adopted and incorporated herein as findings of fact. In addition, the following
findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a federal contractor. His employment
history includes honorable military service in the U.S. Air Force. He served on active
duty during 1973–1983, and he then served four years in the reserve. He has been
continuously employed as an aircraft maintenance mechanic by the same company
since 1999. He worked in a supervisory position from about 2001 or 2002 to late 2009,
when he was demoted and had a loss of pay of about $11,000 annually. 
Applicant married for the first time in 1981; divorced in 1991; and remarried in
2010. His wife is 49 years old, and she is employed as a home healthcare aid. He has
one adult child from his first marriage. He has two adult stepchildren from his second
marriage. No children or grandchildren are living in his household. 
Applicant has a history of financial problems going back to at least the 2001
Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. The bankruptcy came about when  he was unable to meet

his financial obligations.  He did not recall the amount of debt that was discharged, but2
was certain it was less than $100,000. He attributes his current indebtedness, as
reflected by the eight delinquent debts in the SOR, to back taxes owed to the IRS for
multiple tax years.  In about 2006, the matter came to a head and the IRS garnished or3
levied his wages for about $2,800 monthly for three months leaving him about $500
each month. As a result, he fell behind on his other financial obligations. He resolved
the matter with the IRS by agreeing to a monthly payment plan, which was completed
over a two-year period. He is now current with his obligations to the IRS. 
As alleged in the SOR, and established by Applicant’s admissions and the
documentary evidence,  the eight delinquent debts consist of the following: (1) a $5164
collection account; (2) a $1,067 collection account; (3) a $31 medical collection account;
(4) a $179 collection account; (5) a $15,177 collection account stemming from an auto
repossession; (6) a $1,547 collection account; (7) a $651 charged-off account; and (8) a
$218 collection. Seven of the eight debts remain unpaid and unresolved.  He did not5
present any paperwork (e.g., account statements, offers of settlement, correspondence,
etc.) showing the status of these seven accounts or in support of his various claims. But
he did present documentary proof of payment for the $179 collection account.  In6
addition, he presented proof of payment of an account held by a collection agency.  He7
settled the debt for $79 in September 2011. It does not appear to correspond to any of
the debts in the SOR. 
Applicant has not sought out counseling, assistance, or advise from a financial
professional (e.g., an accountant, a certified financial counselor, a credit counselor, etc.)
to address his debts. Likewise, he does not have a plan in place to address his debts.
He has found it difficult to contact creditors, which has hindered his ability to address his
debts.  He described his current financial situation as “really not too good.”  Although he8 9
has the means to meet his current ongoing expenses, he lacks the means to address
the debts in the SOR.10

Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As11
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt12
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An13
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  14
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting15
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An16
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate17
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme18
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.19
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In
security clearance cases, “the federal government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances
surrounding an applicant’s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.”) (citation
omitted).

decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it21
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant22
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline23
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  24
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. The 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the multiple delinquent
debts—the majority of which are unresolved—raise security concerns. Taken together,
these circumstances indicate inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of25
not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are26
 ISCR Case No. 99-0201 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999) (“[T]he concept of ‘good faith’ requires a showing that a27
person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort).

sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. The facts also show that
Applicant’s financial house is in disrepair.  
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;27
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
None of the mitigating conditions, individually or in combination, are sufficient to
overcome and mitigate the security concerns. 
The evidence of Applicant’s problematic financial history justifies current doubts
about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-
consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I gave due

consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence, to28
include his years of honorable military service. With that said, he has done little to help
himself. After his Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2001, he became entangled with the
IRS over back taxes owed for multiple tax years. Although he was eventually able to
resolve that problem, it resulted in falling behind on his other financial obligations.  As
reflected in the SOR, this amounted to about $19,000 in delinquent debts. Of those
debts, he paid one creditor the sum of $218 to resolve a $179 collection account.  
Applicant’s problematic financial history is largely unresolved and it is ongoing.
And that history is inconsistent with the high standards that apply to those who are
granted access to classified information. Perhaps in the future when Applicant has
made a good-faith effort to repay or resolve these debts, or there are clear indications
that his financial problems are being resolved or under control, he can reapply for a
security clearance with the sponsorship of an employer. But based on the evidence
before me, it is too soon to tell if or when Applicant will put his financial house in good
order. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable
clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.i: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
