GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 13, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the 
interrogatories on April 29, 2011.2
                                                          
1 Item 4 (SF 86), dated August 13, 2010. 
 On August 4, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
2 Item 5 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated April 29, 2011).

Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 10, 2011. In a sworn 
statement, dated August 11, 2011,3 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete 
copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on 
September 8, 2011, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days 
after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, 
extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on September 20, 2011, and 
timely submitted an additional statement,4 with an attachment,5
 
 on September 26, 2011. 
The case was assigned to me on October 27, 2011. 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one (¶ 1.k.) of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.p.) of the SOR. 
Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where until October 
7, 2011, she served as an office administrator. On that date, Applicant was terminated 
because she did not yet have a security clearance.6 She previously had a Secret 
security clearance starting in December 1991.7 She enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 
February 1991, and served on active duty until December 2000, when she was 
honorably discharged.8
                                                          
3 Item 3 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated August 11, 2011). 
 She had one overseas assignment in Southern Europe. No 
other information regarding Applicant’s military service was provided. Applicant

attended a community college from August 1998 until October 2000, but did not earn a 
degree.9
 
  
Since her discharge from active duty in December 2000, Applicant worked in a 
variety of positions with various employers, primarily as a workload administrator, 
partner program manager, executive administrative assistant, and executive assistant. 
She joined her most recent employer in August 2010.10 Applicant was also unemployed 
on at least four other occasions. She was laid off from a company that downsized in late 
2001,11 but it is unclear how long that period of unemployment lasted. She was also 
unemployed from January 2003 until February 2003,12 from March 2004 until May 2004, 
and again from November 2007 until July 2010.13
 
   
Applicant was married in June 1993, and divorced in April 1997.14 She has three 
children, born in July 2000, October 2003, and October 2005, respectively.15
 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
It is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties, but it 
appears that her initial period of unemployment in 2001-2002 contributed to such 
difficulties. After being laid off, she was hospitalized for unspecified reasons, and was 
unable to work for an unspecified period.16 She fell behind in maintaining her monthly 
payments, and a substantial number of accounts became delinquent.17 In January 
2002, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.18 
Her unspecified liabilities were discharged in May 2002,19 leaving her with a clean slate, 
financially. Applicant contended that when she secured new employment, and was 
working, she paid her bills, her mortgage, and her car payments.20

 It is unclear what 
impact, if any, her next two brief periods of unemployment had on her ability to remain 
current.

Applicant attributed her current financial difficulties to her lay-off in November 
2007, her continued unemployment until July 2010, the medical condition of her middle 
child, the difficulty in obtaining childcare for a child with special needs, her decision to 
care for her child at home, the difficulty in holding a job while taking children to the 
doctor and day care.21 Applicant chose to stay at home until her daughter was healthy 
enough for Applicant to find a job that would pay her enough to afford proper care and 
pay for the basic necessities.22 She claimed she did her best to pay her bills while 
unemployed, depleting her savings and 401(k), as well as reaching the credit limits of 
her credit cards.23 Applicant noted:24
 
 
Being laid off my job was largely beyond my control and made me 
incapable of paying my debt but I acted as responsible as I could going 
from a $55k salary a year to $16k a year with all the same expenses. I 
acted as responsible as I could to maintain shelter and food and the basic 
necessities needed for living for me and my daughters. 
 
Nevertheless, accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection with a 
variety of collection agents, and some of the accounts were charged off.  
 
The SOR identified 15 continuing delinquencies as reflected by a credit report 
from 2010,25 and another credit report from 2011,26
 
 totaling approximately $71,028. 
Among the delinquencies are credit cards, utility accounts, mobile telephone accounts, 
an automobile loan, and home mortgages. Some accounts have been transferred, 
reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents, and except where the actual 
transfers are reflected in the credit reports, it is nearly impossible to follow the trail from 
one creditor to another. Other accounts are referenced repeatedly in the different credit 
reports, in some instances duplicating other accounts listed, either under the same 
creditor name or under a different creditor name. Some accounts are identified by 
complete account numbers, while others are identified by partial account numbers, in 
some instances eliminating the last four digits, and in others eliminating other digits.   
Applicant claims that she took three classes for one and one-half hour per class 
in both 2009 and 2010, to obtain financial counseling in debt management and 
budgeting.27

2011.28 That financial consultant assisted Applicant in preparing a financial 
management plan (FMP), indicating a monthly net income of $3,274; $3,004 in monthly 
living expenses; and $270 debt payments; with a monthly net remainder of $270 
available for discretionary spending.29 A proposed revision, as well as a personal 
financial statement (PFS) were also presented, indicating a monthly net income of 
$3,274; $2,904 in monthly living expenses; and $320 debt payments; with a monthly net 
remainder of $50 available for discretionary spending.30
 
 
In early July 2010, or some time prior to that date, more than a year before the 
SOR was issued, Applicant applied for a mortgage modification under the Home 
Affordable Modification Program (HAMFP).31 In April 2011, four months before the SOR 
was issued, Applicant wrote letters to seven of her creditors or collection agencies, 
proposing repayment plans.32
 
  
In addition to Applicant’s 2002 bankruptcy, the SOR debts can generally be 
divided into three separate categories: 1) those accounts that were purportedly paid off 
or otherwise resolved; 2) those accounts which were purportedly addressed by 
Applicant and placed into repayment plans; and 3) those accounts about which no 
known action has been taken.  
 
Applicant contends the first category (those accounts that were purportedly paid 
off or otherwise resolved) consists of six accounts: There is an account with a bank 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.), referred to as a bank overdraft portfolio, with a delinquent balance of 
$616, that was placed for collection in August 2010.33 The collection agent made a 
settlement offer of $400.80.34 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the account 
remained unpaid as of August 11, 2011.35 However, in her Answer to the FORM, she 
amended her response and contended the account had been paid in full.36
 
 She failed to 
submit any documentation, such as cancelled checks, receipts, check registers, letters 
from the creditor, etc., to support her contention. 
There are two separate credit card accounts with another bank with delinquent 
balances of $530 (SOR ¶ 1.f.) and $683 (SOR ¶ 1.g.), that were placed for collection

and charged off.37 In her Answer to the FORM, she contended the accounts had been 
paid in full.38
 
 She failed to submit any documentation to support her contention. 
Applicant has a home mortgage loan with an approximate balance of $155,000 
(SOR ¶ 1.i.), that became over 120 days past due, in the amount of $37,119.39 In her 
Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the account status, but indicated she had made 
two of the three scheduled payments, each for $849.72, under the trial period plan of 
the HAMFP.40 She supported her contention with documentary proof of such 
payments.41 In her Answer to the FORM, she claimed the mortgage modification had 
been granted.42
 
 She failed to submit any documentation to support her claim. 
Applicant has a home mortgage loan with a high credit of $36,551 (SOR ¶ 1.j.), 
that became over 180 days past due, in the amount of $46,515.43 In her Answer to the 
FORM, Applicant contended the account had been approved for modification.44
 
 She 
failed to submit any documentation to support her claim. 
There was an automobile loan, with a high credit of $12,689 (SOR ¶ 1.l.), that 
was apparently opened in 2002, and subsequently became delinquent.45 In 2004, the 
account was placed for collection and charged off in the amount of $4,910.46 In 2009, 
another collection agent or debt buyer again reported that $4,910 had been charged 
off.47 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant contended the account was resolved when 
the parties went to court and the matter was dismissed.48 In fact, she was correct, for 
the decision in her favor was issued in the state court in June 2006.49
  
 
Applicant contends the second category (those accounts which were purportedly 
addressed by Applicant and placed into repayment plans) consists of seven accounts: 
One mobile phone account (SOR ¶ 1.c.), with an outstanding balance of $1,392, was

placed for collection in September 2010,50 and eventually assigned to another collection 
agency.51 A utility account (SOR ¶ 1.d.), with an outstanding balance of $997, was 
placed for collection in November 2009.52 One payment to a homeowners association 
was returned for insufficient funds, and the account (SOR ¶ 1.e.), in the amount of 
$480, including fees, was placed for collection in February 2008.53 One telephone 
account (SOR ¶ 1.k.), in the amount of $1,710, was placed for collection in April 2010.54 
Two separate automobile rental accounts with the same rental agency (SOR ¶ 1.m.), in 
the amount of $221, and (SOR ¶ 1.n.), in the amount of $449, were placed for collection 
in August 2010 and September 2009, respectively.55 One bank credit card account 
(SOR ¶ 1.o.), in the amount of $545, was placed for collection in August 2010.56 In her 
Answer to the FORM, she asserted each of the accounts had been entered into agreed 
repayment plans,57
 
 but she did not state the specifics of those plans. She failed to 
submit any documentation to support her assertion. 
The third category (those accounts about which no known action has been 
taken), consists of two accounts: One telephone account (SOR ¶ 1.b.), in the amount of 
$327, was placed for collection November 2009.58 One car loan (SOR ¶ 1.h.), with a 
high credit of $18,865, and a delinquent balance of $10,079, was placed for collection 
and charged off in September 2010.59 Applicant claims she voluntarily relinquished the 
vehicle, and the amount is described as “interest still owed.”60
   
 Applicant has not 
described any actions by her related to resolving these accounts. 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”61

security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”62
 
   
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view tshe guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”63 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.64
 
  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.

and modified.    
 
63 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to 
support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”65
 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”66
 
 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns.  
 
As noted above, in May 2002, Applicant’s debts were discharged under Chapter 
7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Her next period of financial difficulties arose in 
November 2007, when she again encountered financial difficulties which have largely 
continued until the present. Accounts became delinquent and were placed for collection 
or charged off, an automobile was voluntarily relinquished, and mortgages became past 
due. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
                                                          
65 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531 
 
66 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
10 
                                      
 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@67
 
  
 AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. The nature, frequency, and relative recency of 
Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred 
“so long ago” or “was so infrequent.” Applicant attributed her financial difficulties to her 
lay-off, the medical condition of her middle child, the difficulty in obtaining childcare for a 
child with special needs, her decision to care for her child at home, and the difficulty in 
holding a job while taking children to the doctor and day care. With the exception of her 
getting another job in July 2010, Applicant has offered no evidence of any change in her 
family circumstances that might indicate how those earlier described difficulties have 
been minimized by her reemployment. In fact, after analyzing her comments, I have 
found little evidence that Applicant ever took any steps towards obtaining new 
employment “that would pay [her] a salary that [she] could at least live humanely,” until 
2010. In light of Applicant’s lengthy period of continuing financial problems, it is unlikely 
that they will be resolved in the short term, and are likely to recur. Accordingly, Applicant 
failed to mitigate her financial situation, and under the circumstances, her actions do 
cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.68
 
  
AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies because Appellant’s financial situation was, in some 
measure, caused by her lay-off, unemployment, and the medical condition of one of her 
children. However, given the period of unemployment, and Applicant’s decision to 
remain home rather than seeking even part-time employment, it is unclear how much of 
her unemployment was beyond her control. With the exception of seeking a mortgage 
                                                          
67 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

modification for one of her mortgages in 2010, I am unable to conclude that Applicant 
acted responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
AG ¶ 20(c) partially applies because Applicant supposedly received a variety of 
financial counseling and guidance but only provided documentation to support her 
claims regarding the most recent financial counseling.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) applies only very minimally. As noted above, it was not until 2010 that 
Applicant approached her mortgage lender to apply for a mortgage modification under 
HAMFP. It was not until April 2011 that Applicant wrote letters to seven of her creditors 
or collection agencies, proposing repayment arrangements. Of the 15 delinquent 
accounts listed in the SOR, Applicant contended that she paid off or otherwise resolved 
6 accounts; and that 7 accounts were placed into repayment plans. Unfortunately, with 
the exception of one account (SOR ¶ 1.l.), Applicant failed to submit any documentation 
to support her contentions. She has not described any actions with respect to two other 
accounts.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.69
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct: Applicant’s 
unemployment; her child’s health issues; her efforts to modify her home mortgage in 
2010; the seven creditors she wrote in April 2011, proposing repayment plans; and her 
purportedly paying off some accounts, and making some payments.

The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant has a history of repeated financial delinquencies. After the bankruptcy 
discharge of her debts in May 2002, she entered another phase of her financial life, and 
in 2007, again permitted accounts to become delinquent. She contended she is paying 
some accounts under approved repayment plans and that some accounts have been 
paid off. Nevertheless, she failed to submit any documentation, such as cancelled 
checks, receipts, check registers, letters from the creditor, etc., to support her 
contention. As noted above, with the exception of one account, there is no evidence that 
any of the other accounts have been resolved. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
