Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern that arises from his outstanding
delinquent debts. Clearance is denied.  
In March 2011,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a1
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.2
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). On April
27, 2011, Applicant submitted a response to the SOR in which he denied all SOR
allegations and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing. 
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on September
7, 2011, that was mailed to Applicant on September 14, 2011. Applicant was informed he
had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections to any information

contained in the FORM or to submit any additional information he wished to be considered.
Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on September 21, 2011, but did not submit
a response to the FORM or object to anything contained in the FORM within the time
allowed him. The case was assigned to me on November 30, 2011.
Findings of Fact
After a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant is 45 years old and has been employed as a manufacturing technician by
a defense contractor since April 2010. As recorded in the security clearance application
Applicant submitted on June 1, 2010, he has had sporadic employment since March 2003,
that has been interrupted by periods of unemployment due to lay offs. More specifically,
Applicant was unemployed from December 2004 until May 2005, from November 2005
until February 2006, and from February 2009 until March 2010.
 
Applicant has been married since April 2009. He has two children, ages 18 and 16.
The SOR lists seven delinquent accounts that have been submitted for collection.
The combined total owed on those accounts is $18,719. Applicant was questioned about
his delinquent debts in June 2010. He admitted he was responsible for each of the debts
listed in the SOR except the $362 debt listed in subparagraph 1.a. Applicant explained that
this debt arose from a claim by his landlord for cleaning a carpet in an apartment he had
rented. He believes he left the apartment clean and the claim is unjust. Applicant’s credit
reports disclose that some of his delinquent accounts date back as far as 2003.
Applicant told the investigator who interviewed him in June 2010 that his net monthly
income is $3,044. He reported his recurring monthly expenses at $2,996. He attributes his
financial problems to the periods of unemployment he experienced. He told the investigator
that he intended to file for bankruptcy protection. On December 18, 2010, Applicant
responded to interrogatories by stating he had not filed for bankruptcy protection yet but
planned on doing so within two to five months. In his response to the SOR, Applicant
stated he would soon be filing for bankruptcy protection. When he was interviewed in June
2010, Applicant admitted he did not have the funds to hire an attorney to file for bankruptcy
protection for him, but that he intended to borrow $1,500 from his father. 
  
Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial decision based upon the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6
of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be
followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the
 ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.3

evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and
mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. 
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of3 4
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,5
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of6
the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant7
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable8
clearance decision.9
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard10
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access11
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      12
Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
4
Applicant has seven delinquent accounts, owed in the combined amount of $18,719,
that have been submitted for collection. Some of those accounts have been delinquent for
many years. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;
and DC 19C(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.
Applicant’s financial problems are the result of unemployment he has experienced.
However, there is no indication he made any effort to resolve his delinquent accounts when
he was employed. Further, there in no basis to conclude he will be able to resolve them in
the foreseeable future. He has repeatedly asserted he was going to seek bankruptcy
protection, but there is no evidence he has done so. Applicant currently spends virtually
his entire net monthly income on his recurring monthly expenses, and he is not in a
position to extricate himself from the financial distress that has plagued him for years.
Applicant’s continued inaction in doing anything to resolve his delinquent accounts allows
for only minimal application of Mitigating Condition (MC) 20(b): the conditions that resulted
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment,
a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation)
and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. The remaining mitigating
conditions have no applicability to the facts of this case. 
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole-person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶6.3.6 of the Directive, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him
nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-g: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
