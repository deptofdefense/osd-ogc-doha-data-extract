MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
As of June 2010, Applicant owed more than $38,000 in delinquent consumer debt, 
including $13,750 to a credit union for two loans past due since 2004 and 2005. He began 
repaying a judgment debt in August 2009, and has satisfied some smaller debts, but it is too 
soon to conclude that his financial problems are behind him. Clearance denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 14, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations, which provided the basis for its preliminary decision to deny him a 
security clearance. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective 
within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. 
  
 
 
 2 
Applicant answered the SOR on October 20, 2010, and requested a hearing. On 
September 2, 2010, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I scheduled 
a hearing for October 7, 2010. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Eight Government exhibits (Ex. 1-8) and five 
Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-E) were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, as reflected 
in a transcript (Tr.) received on October 14, 2010. 
 
 At Applicant‟s request, I held the record open until December 1, 2010, for him to 
submit evidence of debt repayment. Applicant timely forwarded two additional documents, 
which were entered as exhibits (Ex. F and Ex. G) without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR alleges under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, that as of June 14, 
2010, Applicant owed $41,985 in delinquent consumer credit debt (SOR 1.a–1.l). In his 
Answer, he admitted all the debts except a $137 wireless telephone debt (SOR 1.k) and a 
$3,512 collection debt (SOR 1.l). Applicant‟s admissions are incorporated as findings of 
fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional 
findings of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old security manager responsible for his employer‟s global 
security operations. (Ex. 1; Tr. 32.) He has a master‟s degree in security management, and 
in May 2008, he earned a law degree. (Ex. 2; Tr. 35.) Applicant has worked for his present 
employer since October 2004, and he was granted an interim Secret security clearance. 
(Ex. 1; Tr. 26, 38.) He has never been married, but he is engaged. Applicant and his fiancée 
have been together about 11 years. (Tr. 36.) She has two daughters, the older of which is in 
her sophomore year at a private college. (Tr. 31-32, 37.)  
 
Applicant was involved in a cohabitant relationship with his previous girlfriend. He 
accepted credit card offers received in the mail, and he and his girlfriend bought “stuff” for 
their apartment. (Tr. 81-83.) Around 1997 or 1998, their relationship ended. She moved out 
of their apartment, and he became responsible for repaying several credit card debts in his 
name only. Applicant was employed as a store loss prevention officer at $12 to $13 an hour 
from August 1997 to April 1998. (Ex. 1; Tr. 81.) He was unable to keep up with the 
payments (Ex. 2; Tr. 55.), despite his full-time employment as a regional security manager 
from February 1998 to April 2001. He borrowed from a credit union to consolidate debt 
(SOR 1.i) and for a car (SOR 1.j) in 1998. Around December 2000, Applicant began living 
with his fiancée (Ex. 2; Tr. 36.), and excepting a brief separation from March 2004 to May 
2004, they have had a spousal-like relationship. During this relationship, he opened new 
accounts that became delinquent, as reflected in the following table.

In April 2001, Applicant‟s employer ceased operations when the owner relocated. 
Applicant began working as an operations manager for a large security corporation, but he 
and his employer mutually agreed that the job was not a good fit for him, and Applicant 
resigned in October 2001. Applicant was unemployed until sometime in December 2001. 
(Ex. 1; Tr. 55.) Applicant went to work as an accounts manager and stayed on with a new 
employer after the contract was bought out in January 2004. In October 2004, he began his 
current employment at $55,000 annually. (Ex. 1; Tr. 38.) 
 
In August 2005, Applicant‟s luggage was stolen from the baggage claim area while 
he was on a business trip abroad for his employer. Applicant contacted his business credit 
card lender and was told that he was allowed up to $1,200 in replacement costs, so 
Applicant purchased $1,211 in personal items. He submitted a claim that was denied. While 
his appeal of the denial was pending, he made no payments on the debt, and his account 
went to collection. Around January 2007, Applicant was informed that the creditor was liable 
only in the event the luggage was lost by the airline and not in the case of theft after it had 
left the airline‟s possession. Applicant settled the debt for less than its full balance. (Ex. 2; 
8.) 
 
 On February 27, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). He responded “Yes” to question 27.d, “In the last 7 
years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid?” He listed the 
 
 5 
judgment debt in SOR 1.a. However, he indicated that he was appealing the judgment. In 
response to the financial delinquency inquiries, Applicant admitted that he had been over 
180 days delinquent on debts in the last seven years. Yet, he listed only the business credit 
card debt (not alleged) that he disputed. (Ex. 1.) 
 
 On November 29, 2007, and again on April 9, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an 
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, in part about his delinquent debts. 
Applicant indicated during his first interview that he had been paying from $50 to $100 per 
month on the credit card debt identified in SOR 1.e, to reduce the balance to around $500, 
and that the debt would be satisfied by January 2009. He disputed the debts in SOR 1.f and 
1.l as not his debts. He also contested the amount of the judgment award in SOR 1.a 
because that credit card had only a $3,000 limit. Applicant indicated that he was working 
with the credit union to resolve the debts in SOR 1.i and 1.j. When he was re-interviewed, 
he acknowledged that he had made no payments toward the judgment in SOR 1.a because 
he had forgotten about it. He added that he had the judgment dismissed in early 2008, and 
that he was seeking to settle with the creditor. Applicant averred that he was capable of 
meeting all his financial obligations. (Ex. 2.) 
 
 In response to DOHA inquiries about the efforts taken, if any, to resolve his 
delinquent debts, Applicant indicated in April 2010 that he was paying $100 per month on 
the judgment in SOR 1.a. He did not recognize the $91 medical debt (SOR 1.b), and 
maintained that the $309 cable television debt (SOR 1.c) should have been paid by his ex-
girlfriend. He did not dispute owing the debts in the SOR, except for the wireless debt in 
SOR 1.k, which he had paid, and the collection debt in 1.l, which he explained was not his. 
Applicant indicated that he was beginning to work with a debt management company to deal 
with his admitted debts. (Ex. 3.) 
 
 Applicant contacted a few debt resolution firms, but the proposed payment of $900 
per month was more than he could afford. (Tr. 66.) Applicant intends to satisfy his debts one 
at a time. (Tr. 33.) 
 
 Since about 2000, Applicant has been supplementing his income by refereeing 
volleyball games, on average six hours per month. (Ex. 2.) As a self-employed, certified 
referee, he works on weekends, more frequently during the fall. He earns between $5,000 
and $6,000 a year, depending on his assignments. (Tr. 43-44.) As of October 2010, 
Applicant was also coaching soccer at a private school. In November 2010, he expected to 
be paid $4,000 to $5,000 for his referring and coaching duties. (Tr. 43-45.) As of October 
2010, his annual salary from his primary job with the defense contractor was almost 
$61,000. (Tr. 38.) Applicant initially testified that his employer has not given out any raises 
to employees in the last two years. (Tr. 30.) But he later admitted that he received a “half 
bonus” in 2009. (Tr. 62.) 
 
 Applicant drives a 2005-model year car that he purchased in September 2010 
through a loan of $12,000, after a down payment between $1,000 and $1,200 borrowed 
from his 401(k). (Tr. 58, 64, 66, 80.) His first car payment of $300 was due within a few days 
of his October 2010 hearing. Applicant‟s previous automobile was 14 years old with 190,000 
miles on the odometer. (Tr. 80.) 
 
 6 
 
 Applicant shares expenses with his fiancée including their mortgage payment, which 
is almost $2,600 per month. Applicant and his fiancée each pay half of the monthly 
mortgage. (Tr. 56.) He pays for the heating oil, which averages $200 a month on an annual 
basis (Tr. 57.); their car insurance at $270 per month (Tr. 59.); and cell and landline phones, 
cable television, and Internet at $400 total per month. (Tr. 58.) 
  
 Applicant‟s fiancée pays a larger share of her daughters‟ expenses (Tr. 56.), and she 
covers the groceries (Tr. 57.), electricity, and water. (Tr. 61.) He pays for the heating oil and 
$270 per month for their car insurance. She covers the groceries. (Tr. 57-59.) His fiancée 
makes about $50,000 annually from her employment, another $10,000 to $12,000 from her 
flower shop, and she also receives child support of $22,000 annually. (Tr. 56, 61.) In 2009, 
Applicant‟s fiancée‟s ex-husband did not meet his obligation to pay college costs for his 
daughter. So last fall, Applicant put out $4,000 of his coaching income to keep his fiancée‟s 
daughter in college. (Tr. 32, 72-73.) 
 
 Applicant financed his law school education through student loans. As of December 
2009, he owed about $85,139 in student loan debt. Repayment was deferred based on 
economic hardship. (Tr. 60, 68, 71.) The loans were scheduled to come out of deferment in 
November 2010, although he testified that he could defer them for a longer period if 
necessary. (Tr. 69.) His total monthly payment on the loans will be around $773. (Ex. 5; Tr. 
69-70.) As of December 2009, one credit bureau reported that Applicant owed an additional 
$1,966 in student loan debt from 1989 and 1990 when he pursued his bachelor‟s degree. 
The accounts were also deferred. (Ex. 2; 5; Tr. 69.) Applicant has no new personal credit 
card debt. (Ex. 5; Tr. 60.) In September 2010, he was issued a business credit card for work 
expenses. The account has a balance around $100 that had to be paid by October 18, 
2010. (Tr. 83-84.) Applicant has no savings but he has around $4,000 in 401(k) assets. (Tr. 
64-65.) Most of his estimated $500 in monthly discretionary funds has gone to pay for 
gasoline and eating out. (Tr. 87.) 
 
 Applicant has handled his often sensitive and stressful duties as global security 
manager for his employer with professionalism and dedication. His coworkers have found 
him to be reliable, trustworthy, and conscientious. (Ex. B-E.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a „right‟ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant‟s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are 
not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge‟s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
 
 7 
decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number 
of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive Order 
10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, 
Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about finances is set out in AG ¶ 18, as follows:  
     
Failure or inability to live within one‟s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having 
to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several security concerns under AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially 
applicable in this case: 
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 
 8 
As of the June 2010 SOR, Applicant owed more than $38,000 in delinquent debt, 
including judgment debts around $1,400 and $8,000. His failure to remain current in his 
financial obligations clearly implicates disqualifying conditions AG ¶ 19(a) and ¶ 19(c). 
 
Mitigating condition AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so long ago, was so 
infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual‟s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,” cannot 
reasonably apply. The credit card debts in SOR 1.e and 1.f have been delinquent for more 
than seven years. However, according to his available credit record, several of the debts in 
the SOR became past due while he has worked for his present employer earning at least 
$55,000 annually. Furthermore, most of his delinquent debt remains unpaid. 
 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his breakup with his former girlfriend, 
when his hourly wage was only $12 to $13. However, AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that 
resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person‟s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,” has only limited 
applicability to those debts (SOR 1.f and likely 1.e), which became delinquent because of 
the termination of this personal relationship, and the costs associated with having to 
maintain a household on his limited income. He borrowed from the credit union to 
consolidate debt (SOR 1.i) and for a car (SOR 1.j) while he was living on his own, before he 
began cohabitating with his fiancée in December 2000. But even so, it is difficult to mitigate 
his total disregard of those loans since early 2005. AG ¶ 20(b) also does not apply to those 
debts in SOR 1.a-1.d, 1.g-1.h, and 1.k, which were opened and became delinquent while 
his fiancée was paying a share of their household expenses. Applicant had some 
unexpected expenses in recent years, most notably the $1,200 he spent to replace the 
personal items stolen in his luggage in August 2005, and the $4,000 he paid to keep his 
fiancée‟s daughter in college in the fall of 2009. But his salary has been at least $55,000 
since October 2004, and he shares household expenses with his fiancée. He has not 
explained why he could not make even the minimum payment on a $438 credit card 
balance in February 2008 (SOR 1.h), for example. Law school expenses were not shown to 
be a factor, in that his sizeable school loans are still in hardship deferment. 
 
 Applicant satisfied the wireless telephone debt (SOR 1.k) two or three years ago. 
After his hearing, he satisfied the $91 medical debt (SOR 1.b) and the $309 cable television 
debt (SOR 1.c), and he made the first of arranged payments to resolve the debt in SOR 1.h. 
Weighing more heavily in his favor, he has been paying the judgment creditor in SOR 1.a at 
$100 per month since August 2009. Yet, AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated a good-faith 
effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” is not fully implicated when the 
payments have been prompted by civil judgment actions, debt collection efforts, or concern 
for his security clearance. As of October 2010, he had not contacted those creditors 
identified in SOR 1.d-1.g or the credit union that lent him funds in 1998 for debt 
consolidation (SOR 1.i) and a car (SOR 1.j). He borrowed from his 401(k) for the down 
payment for the car he recently financed. He had no accumulated savings to cover 
unexpected expenses. There is no evidence that he has budgeted for the $773 in student 
loan repayment that will be required each month once his law school loans are no longer 
deferred. AG ¶ 20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
 
 9 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” is 
not yet established. Satisfaction of his delinquent debt is not required for access, and his 
recent reliance on cash purchases rather than credit cards is some indication of financial 
responsibility. But a longer track record of debt repayment is required before I can 
confidently conclude that his financial problems are safely behind him. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
applies to the debt alleged in SOR 1.l. Applicant disputed the debt with the credit reporting 
agencies as of October 2007, on the basis that he had never lived at the address of the 
person named on the account. AG ¶ 20(d) also applies to the wireless telephone debt in 
SOR 1.k because the debt had been paid and was no longer past due as of when the SOR 
was issued. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant‟s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and all 
relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual‟s age and maturity at 
the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
Applicant‟s job has placed him at times in stressful situations, and by all accounts, he 
has been conscientious and professional. His ability to remain calm, and to respect the 
sensitivity and confidentiality of the matters before him, weighs favorably when assessing 
his current security eligibility. However, Applicant failed to display a similar level of 
dedication and responsibility in his handling of his personal financial affairs. Applicant has 
an ongoing obligation to contact his creditors and at least attempt to settle the debts, 
whether or not 90 percent of his debts went delinquent over ten years ago (see Tr. 96, 
testimony as to percentage of old debt unsubstantiated in the record) or whether a particular 
creditor actively pursues collection. His eleventh-hour efforts to address several of the debts 
in the SOR are not sufficient to overcome the doubts about his judgment raised by about 
$38,000 in unresolved delinquent debt.
