HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s statement of reasons (SOR) lists nine delinquent debts totaling 
$276,097. He failed to make sufficient progress resolving three delinquent SOR debts, 
which are owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) ($181,000), a credit card 
company ($2,377), and for his voluntarily repossessed motor home ($41,628). Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated, and eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 18, 2010, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application (SF 86) (GE 1). On 
November 4, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an 
SOR to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  
 
 
2 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the 
preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant’s 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). 
 
On December 7, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On February 11, 2011, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to 
proceed on Applicant’s case. On February 17, 2011, DOHA assigned Applicant’s case 
to me. On March 1, 2011, DOHA issued a hearing notice. (HE 1) On March 21, 2011, 
Applicant’s hearing was held. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits 
(GE 1-3) (Tr. 18), and Applicant offered four exhibits. (Tr. 51-55; AE A-D) There were no 
objections, and I admitted GE 1-3 and AE A-D. (Tr. 18-19, 53-54) Additionally, I 
admitted the hearing notice, SOR, and Applicant’s response to the SOR as hearing 
exhibits. (HE 1-3) On March 31, 2011, I received the transcript.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant’s SOR response admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a (state tax debt of 
$1,966). He stated he had an established payment plan, which was resolving this state 
tax debt. He admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b (IRS debt of $181,000) and explained he is 
working on a repayment plan. He denied responsibility in full or in part for the remainder 
of the SOR debts and provided documentation describing how the debts arose or were 
resolved. His admissions are accepted as factual findings.   
 
Applicant is a 64-year-old senior safety and health specialist, who has been 
employed by a Government contractor since 1985.2 (Tr. 5, 55) He graduated from high 
school in 1965. (Tr. 5) In 1983, he received a bachelor’s degree in healthcare 
administration. (Tr. 7)  
 
Applicant enlisted in the Navy in June 1966, and served as a hospital corpsman 
until February 1970. (Tr. 6) His service included a tour in the Republic of Vietnam. (Tr. 
6) He returned to active duty in the Navy from 1974 to 1981 and served as a hospital 
corpsman. (Tr. 6) He received a discharge under honorable conditions after both 
enlistments. After leaving active Navy service, he was employed at a Navy shipyard. 
(Tr. 7)  
 
Applicant married his spouse in 1968. His children were born in 1969, 1973, and 
1977. (Tr. 54-55) He did not report any adverse information concerning alcohol or drug 
abuse or involvement with law enforcement or judicial authorities. He has held a secret

security clearance since 1976. (Tr. 8, 56) He believes he will probably be able to retain 
his employment even if he loses his security clearance. (Tr. 56-57)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant disclosed a problem with the IRS and the voluntary repossession of his 
motor home on his May 18, 2010 SF 86. (GE 1) His SOR listed nine debts totaling 
$276,097 as follows: (a) state tax lien ($1,966); (b) federal tax lien entered by the IRS 
($181,000); (c) medical debt ($50); (d) credit card debt ($2,377); (e) repossessed motor 
home debt ($89,858); (f) county tax lien ($260); (g) judgment ($261); (h) judgment 
($275); and (i) medical debt ($50).     
 
SOR ¶ 1.a (state tax lien)—Payment Plan. Applicant has begun a payment 
plan, which will resolve the state tax debt listed on his SOR. (HE 3 at 1) One hundred 
dollars is automatically taken out of his bank account each month. (Tr. 58) Applicant has 
paid at least $1,370 towards this debt. (Tr. 59) 
 
Applicant’s spouse’s 1996 settlement and SOR ¶ 1.b (IRS debt)—
Unresolved. In 1984, Applicant’s spouse was injured when she inhaled some toxic 
paint chemicals at work. (Tr. 21-22, 28) Workman’s compensation paid her medical 
expenses. (Tr. 28-29) In about 1991, she went on total disability from Social Security. 
(Tr. 41-42) In about 1996, she received a $2 million dollar award (less attorney fees) 
from her employer. (Tr. 21-25, 29) She entrusted an investment expert with investment 
of $1,684,000 from the settlement and over the years Applicant and his spouse 
gradually spent or gave the funds to their children. (Tr. 30, 43-45, 49, 102-103) She 
received quarterly statements showing the status of her investments. (Tr. 30-32) Her 
investment advisor told her that none of the money from her settlement was taxable, 
and she interpreted this advice to be the profits on the investment of her settlement 
funds were also tax free. (Tr. 32-33) She denied that she received 1099 forms showing 
the amount of her profits on the sale of various investments. (Tr. 30, 33-34) She insisted 
she was unaware that the sale of the investments, such as stocks and mutual funds, 
amounted to a taxable event. (Tr. 40) Her investment advisor provided all of the annual 
1099s to the IRS about four years ago. (Tr. 22-25, 34) The investment advisor could not 
locate the annual 1099s that were supposed to be sent from 1997 to 2006. (Tr. 35) Her 
settlement fund was exhausted in about 2007. (Tr. 42) 
 
Applicant and his spouse have filed joint federal tax returns for many years. (Tr. 
35-36) The IRS sought additional taxes, interest, and penalties totaling about $182,000. 
The IRS placed a lien on Applicant’s property. (HE 3 at 29) Applicant’s tax attorney and 
the IRS have been discussing settlement amounts and options for about three or four 
years. (Tr. 36-37) On December 1, 2010, Applicant’s tax attorney billed him for $3,183 
for work on his tax problems. (Tr. 27; HE 3 at 30) Applicant’s spouse used $126,000 
from the settlement fund to pay off the mortgage on their residence. (Tr. 38) On 
February 4, 2011, Applicant and his spouse applied for a mortgage loan in the amount 
of $181,000 which is intended to be used to pay their federal tax lien. (Tr. 42-43; AE D) 
Their home is currently valued at about $460,000. (Tr. 46) She thought the IRS would

reduce the settlement amount by dropping some penalties. (Tr. 40) The $181,000 IRS 
debt is a joint debt. (Tr. 36)  
 
Applicant and his spouse used about $150,000 of the settlement fund to assist 
their daughter and son-in-law when they were unemployed over about a five-year 
period. (Tr. 43-45) They provided $35,000 to their son to purchase his former spouse’s 
share of their house. (Tr. 49, 102) They spent $20,000 on another daughter’s wedding. 
(Tr. 103) They lost about $200,000 on their investments over the years; however, they 
were unable to use their losses to offset their gains because they did not timely include 
the losses in their tax returns. (Tr. 44) Applicant was unaware about whether state 
taxing entities would be seeking additional taxes from him and his spouse, and 
Applicant did not know whether they declared the income from their settlement on their 
state tax returns over the period from 1997 to 2007. (Tr. 60-61)      
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.i (medical debts)—Disputed. Applicant disputed his 
responsibility for the two $50 medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.i. with the creditor and 
the collection company that received the debt. (Tr. 62-66; HE 3 at 8) Applicant went to a 
clinic for medical care. According to his insurance plan, the charge was supposed to be 
$10; however, the creditor sought $50, contending the treatment was from an 
emergency room as opposed to a clinic. (Tr. 62-66, 85-87; HE 3 at 8) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d (credit card)—Unresolved. Applicant disputed his responsibility for 
the credit card debt of $2,377. He said his credit card was stolen about ten years ago, 
and he alleged some of the charges on the card were not his charges. (Tr. 66-71; HE 3 
at 8-9) He reported the loss of the card to the credit card company within two days of 
the loss. (Tr. 68) He wanted to see the signatures on the credit card charges to 
determine which ones were his or his spouse’s charges. (Tr. 67) He did not offer to pay 
the charges he actually owes. (Tr. 69)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.e (repossessed motor home)—Unresolved. In 2003, Applicant and 
his spouse purchased a motor home for $120,000 and did not provide any money for a 
down payment. (Tr. 74-75) In 2009, their motor home was voluntarily repossessed. At 
the time of repossession, Applicant and his spouse owed $89,463 to the creditor. (HE 3 
at 15) On October 14, 2009, their motor home was sold at a private sale for $55,000. 
(HE 3 at 15) The creditor sought interest, late charges and various fees totaling $7,164. 
(HE 3 at 15) On October 30, 2009, the creditor wrote Applicant seeking $41,628. (Tr. 
72, 79-80; HE 3 at 15) On January 25, 2010 and February 23, 2010, Applicant sent a 
telefax asking for additional information. (HE 3 at 16, 17) On September 27, 2010, 
Applicant offered to settle the debt for $10,610. (Tr. 81; HE 3 at 19) The $10,610 would 
be paid using a payment plan and not a lump sum payment. (Tr. 84) Applicant also 
argued that under state law if he had paid 60% of the deferred payment price at the time 
of the default he had a right to surrender the mobile home and be released from further 
obligation under the contract. (Tr. 72-74; HE 3 at 21) However, 60% of $120,000 is 
$72,000; and Applicant still owed $89,463. (Tr. 76-78, 96-98) On November 17, 2010, 
the creditor wrote offering to settle the $41,628 debt for 70% of the balance or $29,140 
and suggesting a payment plan of $200 per month. (Tr. 98-99; HE 3 at 18) Applicant did 
 
5 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
not respond to the November 17, 2010 counteroffer because he was waiting for a better 
counteroffer from the creditor. (Tr. 81-84)       
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f to 1.h (tax debts)—Successfully Disputed. Applicant provided 
evidence that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($260), 1.g ($261), and 1.h ($275) were 
erroneous and the liens were removed at the request of the filing entity. (Tr. 84-85; HE 3 
at 3-7) I granted the Government’s motion to withdraw SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h. (Tr. 85)   
 
Applicant noted that his spouse was primarily responsible over the years for 
handling their debts and investments. He recognized that he had a financial 
responsibility for paying joint debts such as their IRS debt, their joint credit cards, and 
jointly-made loans, such as the loan used to purchase their voluntarily repossessed 
motor home.   
      
Character evidence 
 
 Three character references have known Applicant both at work and as friends in 
total for decades.3 They described him as very dependable, honest, intelligent, 
personable, hard working, trustworthy, conscientious, and reliable. He has exceptional 
integrity. He is extremely dedicated to his family and work. He is always willing to help 
others, and he is a tremendous asset to his company. 
 
 Applicant’s spouse has been married to Applicant for 43 years. (Tr. 48) She said, 
“he has the highest integrity of anybody that I know.” (Tr. 48) 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
 
3The sources for the information in this paragraph are three letters from the character witnesses 
dated March 17 and 18, 2011. (AE A to C)  
 
6 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be 
a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision 
should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on 
any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. 
It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President 
and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 
at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
  Upon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all 
appropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security 
concern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
  AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: 
 
 
7 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
  
AG ¶ 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; and 
“(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 
(App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the 
burden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not 
responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(Internal citation omitted.) Applicant’s history of delinquent debt is documented in his 
credit reports, SOR response, and his statement at his hearing. Applicant’s SOR lists 
nine delinquent debts totaling $276,097. His $181,000 federal tax debt has been 
delinquent for about four years. The Government established the disqualifying 
conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible 
applicability of mitigating conditions.   
   
  Five mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
 
8 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                        
                                           
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant has a good understanding 
of how to resolve his debts, and he received some financial counseling and advice from 
his tax attorney. However, he did not establish “there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control.” He did not establish that he acted in good 
faith4 in regard to his $181,000 debt owed to the IRS, the debt resulting from his 
repossessed motor home, and his credit card that had some fraudulent charges on it. 
His IRS debt was initially caused by a condition largely beyond his control because his 
investment advisor failed to send 1099 forms to Applicant and to the IRS; however, he 
did not prove that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He had the means to 
pay the IRS for four years (by taking out a mortgage on his house) and did not begin the 
process of repaying the IRS until February 2011.  
 
Applicant did not make sufficient effort to maintain contact and to resolve the 
debt owed to the creditor who repossessed his motor home.5 On September 27, 2010, 
he offered to settle the debt for $10,610. On November 17, 2010, the creditor counter 
offered to settle the $41,628 debt by proposing that Applicant agree to pay the creditor 
$29,140 and start $200 monthly payments. There is no correspondence from Applicant 
to the creditor or from the creditor to Applicant after November 17, 2010. This is not 
sufficient to establish Applicant is engaged in an ongoing effort to resolve this debt. 
      
Applicant’s establishment of a payment plan for one debt totaling $1,966 is not 
sufficient to establish that his delinquent debt is unlikely to recur. His track record of 
financial responsibility shows insufficient effort, good judgment, trustworthiness, and 
reliability to warrant mitigation of financial considerations concerns.  
 
4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant 
must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does 
not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of 
good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must 
do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as 
bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

5“Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a 
reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. 
Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 
at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is 
whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep 
debts current.

I have credited Applicant with refuting the allegation in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.i. 
Applicant disputed his responsibility for the two $50 medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 
1.i. Applicant went to a clinic for medical care. According to his insurance plan, the 
charge was supposed to be $10; however, the creditor sought $50 contending the 
treatment was from an emergency room as opposed to a clinic.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
The ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG ¶ 2(c). I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant’s clearance is insufficient to 
support a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support 
approval of his access to classified information. Applicant is a 64-year-old senior safety 
and health specialist, who has been employed by a Government contractor since 1985. 
He is sufficiently mature to understand and comply with his security responsibilities. He 
deserves substantial credit for volunteering to support the U.S. Government as an 
employee of a contractor and during his years of active duty Navy service, especially his 
service in the Republic of Vietnam. He graduated from high school in 1965. In 1983, he 
earned a bachelor’s degree in healthcare administration. He married his spouse in 
1968. His children were born in 1969, 1973, and 1977. He did not report any adverse 
information concerning involvement with law enforcement or judicial authorities. He has 
held a secret security clearance since 1976. There is every indication that he is loyal to 
the United States and his employer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or 
uses illegal drugs. His spouse’s investment advisor’s failure to provide 1099s to 
Applicant and the IRS contributed to his financial woes. Four character witnesses laud 
his diligence, professionalism, integrity, trustworthiness, and responsibility. I give 
Applicant substantial credit for credibly explaining his financial circumstances. These 
factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.

 The whole-person factors against reinstatement of Applicant’s clearance are 
more substantial. Applicant’s SOR listed nine debts totaling $276,097. He has mitigated 
six of the nine SOR debts. He has not mitigated his federal tax lien entered by the IRS 
($181,000); his credit card debt ($2,377); and his repossessed motor home debt 
($89,858) as described in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e, respectively. Although he will likely 
be able to settle the three debts for substantially less than the amounts listed in the 
SOR, especially the credit card debt which is not legally collectable because the statute 
of limitations has expired, he has not made sufficient effort and progress resolving these 
three debts. There is also the possibility that he has additional state tax debt because 
he and his spouse may not have declared the income from the profits on her settlement 
over the years on their state tax returns. I decline to consider this possible new debt as 
adverse financial information.6 Financial considerations security concerns are not fully 
mitigated at this time.    
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and 
circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations 
concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f to 1.h:  For Applicant (Withdrawn) 
Subparagraph 1.i:   For Applicant 
 
 
 
6The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to pay some of his state income taxes arising from 
the profits received from his spouse’s settlement fund. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 
26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be 
considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). I decline to consider the possible non-SOR state tax debt for any purpose because 
Applicant did not have a full opportunity to address this debt at his hearing.

Conclusion 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.
