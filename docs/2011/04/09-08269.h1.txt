Decision

LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
he has a history of financial problems or difficulties, to include back taxes and a Chapter
13 bankruptcy case that ended in a dismissal as opposed to a discharge. Other than the
bankruptcy payments, he has not made any progress toward resolving approximately
$50,000 in delinquent debts. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut,
explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from his history of
financial problems. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against
Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on June 29, 2010,1
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and
it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations.   
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to me October 7, 2010. The hearing took place November 15, 2010. The transcript (Tr.)
was received November 23, 2010.
At the close of evidence, I held the record open until December 6, 2010, to allow
Applicant to present documentary evidence, as he did not do so during the hearing. His
post-hearing submission, consisting of 21 pages of various matters, is admitted without
objections as Exhibit A.   
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s responses to the SOR were mixed and included some admissions
and explanations. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. In addition, the
following findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.  
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to
retain a security clearance previously granted to him by the Defense Department.  2
Applicant married in 1991, he and his wife have lived apart from each other since
1997, and they have not yet divorced. He has a child born in 2001 from another
relationship. He pays child support on a monthly basis, and he submitted documentary
evidence showing regular payments for a number of years.  He has worked as a marine3
electrician for a federal contractor since at least 2000. More recently in 2009, his
company selected him as one of the first participants in an apprentice program
designed to encourage employees to explore a range of academic and on-the-job

training opportunities.  His educational background includes a bachelor’s degree in4
business administration and two associate’s degrees.  He also obtained three5
certificates of study in the subject of information technology.  6
Applicant’s employment history includes active duty military service in the U.S.
Navy.  He was discharged after about 15 years of honorable service in 1996, when he7
received about $10,000 in separation pay.  The Department of Veterans Affairs has8
determined that Applicant is entitled to compensation for a service-connected disability
rated at 30 percent or more.  As a result, he receives monthly compensation of $644.9
He held a security clearance (issued by the Navy) during some of his military service
without a negative incident. He was discharged at the pay grade of E-5; his rate was
petty officer second class; and his rating was electrician’s mate.
 
Applicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which are ongoing.10
His problematic financial history dates back to at least 2005, when he sought relief via a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy case.  (SOR ¶ 1.j) The bankruptcy court confirmed or approved11
a repayment plan for Applicant’s creditors in April 2006, and thereafter Applicant made
monthly payments until sometime in 2008. The court dismissed the case in July 2008 on
Applicant’s motion because he was no longer able to make the required payments. He
testified that his wages were reduced in 2007 or 2008, when his then employer was
purchased by his current employer.  At the closing of his Chapter 13 case in December12
2008, bankruptcy court records showed the following: (1) Applicant paid about $25,635
into the repayment plan; (2) 20 creditors had no balance due; and (3) 17 creditors had a
total balance due of about $28,000.  (SOR ¶ 1.k) In addition, the records showed a13
debt of $5,699 owed to the IRS had no balance due, and a debt of $1,644 owed to the
IRS had a balance due of $1,221. To date, he has not paid any of the outstanding debts
owed to the 17 bankruptcy creditors.14

In addition to the bankruptcy case, the SOR alleged nine delinquent debts in
amounts ranging from $445 to $8,020 for a total of about $23,771. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.i)
Those debts consist of state and federal tax liens, two unpaid judgments, and five
collection accounts.  
Concerning the tax debts, state and federal tax authorities began the
garnishment of Applicant’s pay in 2009; the state tax lien was in the amount of $4,050;
the federal tax lien was in the amount of $5,261.  He attributed the back taxes to15
accounting issues stemming from a home-based business he once operated. He
presented a copy of a tax refund check, dated November 23, 2010, for $8.68, which
suggests but does not affirmatively establish that the back taxes owed to the state are
paid.  He did not present any documentary evidence concerning the back taxes owed16
to the IRS. He testified that he made his last payment to the IRS sometime in 2008 or
2009, but he did not present proof of that payment.17
Concerning the unpaid judgments, a $1,965 judgment filed in September 2002,18
and a $4,549 judgment filed in October 2006 remain unpaid.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f)19
These two judgments were part of a series of lawsuits brought by Applicant’s former
landlord due to Applicant’s failure to pay rent.  Applicant satisfied three other20
judgments obtained by the landlord, and one case ended in a dismissal.  A $84121
judgment filed in May 2002 remains unsatisfied as well.  22
The five collection accounts, for a total of about $5,457, are unresolved. (SOR ¶¶
1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h) Applicant testified that he does not have sufficient funds to
repay the collection accounts or any of the other unresolved delinquent debts.23
Likewise, he testified that he does not have any financial assets to draw upon in order to
make payments on the delinquent debts.24

Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As25
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt26
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An27
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  28
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting29
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An30
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate31
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme32
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.33

 Executive Order 10865, § 7.35
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 36
 See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an37
applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness
or recurring financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted). 
 AG ¶ 18.  38

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.34
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it35
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant36
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline37
F is:
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  38
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. This raises security concerns because it indicates inability or

 AG ¶ 20 (a)–(f). 41
7
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within39 40
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions. 
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F.  Any of the41
following may mitigate security concerns:  
¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts;
¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
Of those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent are ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d). I have
considered these mitigating conditions in light of the evidence as a whole, and none,
individually or in combination, is sufficient to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
security concerns stemming from Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties. 
Applicant’s reduction in wages in 2007 or 2008 was a circumstance largely
beyond his control and no doubt played a part in his financial problems. Previously in
2005, he took action via the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case to resolve his delinquent
debts. He was about in the middle of the court-approved repayment plan when he had
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).42
8
the bankruptcy case dismissed due to his reduction in wages and inability to make the
requirement payment. His cumulative payment of about $25,000 into the Chapter 13
plan receives favorable consideration because it shows a good-faith effort. But what is
missing here is evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquencies since
dismissal of the bankruptcy case in 2008. It appears Applicant now has a total of about
$50,000 in delinquent debts. He does not have a realistic plan, has not taken any
substantial action, and does not have sufficient means to address his delinquencies. Of
particular concern is the federal tax debt. Applicant did not present any documentary
evidence to show the debt’s current status or his efforts to resolve it. In general,
Applicant’s case in mitigation suffers from a lack of documentary evidence showing his
efforts to resolve the financial matters at issue. 
To conclude, the evidence as a whole justifies current doubts about Applicant’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent
standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this
conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s42
favorable evidence, to include his honorable military service and his status as a service-
connected disabled veteran. Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against
Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.k: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
