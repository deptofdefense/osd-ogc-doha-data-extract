APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
Julie R. Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Sheldon I. Cohen, Esq.
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security
clearance.  On May 13, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the
basis for that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On January 12, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy F.
Foreman granted Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed
pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Department Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in
declining to reopen the record and whether the Judge’s favorable decision under Guideline F was
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the
decision of the Judge.
The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a
Federal contractor.  She was cleared for sensitive compartmented information (SCI) from 1988 until
1999 and has held a secret clearance since 2008.
A Ph.D. in political science, Applicant was a university professor during the mid-1980s.  She
worked for a consulting firm in the late 1980s.  From 1989 until 1999 she was vice-president for a
company working as a federal contractor, making around $115,000 a year.  From 1999 until 2002
she worked for another company, making about $200,000 a year.  The company downsized and
Applicant was unemployed from 2002 until 2004.  
Her job loss caused financial problems.  She lived off savings and borrowed money from her
parents. She did consulting work during 2004, earning about $3,000 a month.  In 2004 she filed for
Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but the petition was dismissed because she failed to make the payments.
Additionally, she sold her house in 2005, paying off the mortgages and using the equity for living
expenses.  She worked as a waitress in that year as well.  In 2006 she returned to work for her
previous employer.  In 2007 she was earning $6,000 per year.  Her pay increased in 2009 to $90,000
and, later that year, to $178,000, at which point she began contacting creditors for her largest debts.
Her pay was cut in half due to a business downturn and, in August 2010, she began working for her
present employer, earning about $188,000 per year.
Applicant is divorced and has a 24 year old son.  She has received no child support from the
father.  She has lived with a domestic partner since 2003.  He suffered a stroke, and his only income
is from disability payments of about $1,900 a month.
Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, for credit cards, an automobile lease, and a
judgment against her in favor of a law firm.  The credit card debts are alleged in the SOR in the
following amounts:  ¶ 1(b): $30,325; ¶ 1(c): $26,724; ¶ 1(d): $31,050; ¶ (f): $59,396; and ¶ 1(h):
$14,000.  ¶¶ (b) and (c) allege the same underlying debt.  Applicant used the card alleged in (b) to
pay her son’s college tuition.  She also used the cards to pay living expenses while she was
unemployed and to consolidate other debts. 
Applicant has settled the credit card debts and the auto lease debt alleged in the SOR.
Additionally, she has paid or settled numerous other debts not alleged in the SOR.  She has not
settled the debt underlying the judgment. 
Department Counsel argues that the Judge erred in declining to reopen the record and
consider new evidence raising security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  The basis
for the request is as follows: at the hearing Applicant was questioned about a background
investigation for SCI conducted by another Government agency.  The investigation had been
discontinued prior to a decision.
At the hearing, Applicant was questioned about the judgment against her.  She had stated that
she had been unaware of the judgment (as opposed to the underlying debt itself) until the security
clearance investigation at issue in this case.  When asked if the other Government agency had put
her on notice of the judgment during its investigation, she replied, “No; not that I recall.”  Tr. at 128.
 After the hearing was over, Department Counsel consulted with representatives of the other
Government agency.  Department Counsel was provided with documents describing the contents
of Applicant’s clearance interview conducted by the other agency in late 2007/early 2008.
Department Counsel alleges that these documents provide a reason to believe that the other agency
did indeed put Applicant on notice of the judgment.    
Department Counsel submitted to the Judge a motion to reopen the record, take in the newly-
obtained evidence supplied by the other agency, and amend the SOR to allege a Guideline E security
concern pertaining to a false statement at the hearing.  
The Judge denied the motion.  He noted that Directive ¶ E3.1.17 permits a Judge to amend
a SOR at the hearing in order to render it in conformity with the evidence.  However, the Judge
stated that the request in this case was made after the hearing.  He concluded that he had no authority
to reopen the record under the circumstances of this case and that the Government’s remedy was to
issue a new SOR alleging the Guideline E concern.
We find no error in the Judge’s ruling on this issue.  We find no support in the Directive for
the proposition that a Judge is required to reopen a record and amend a SOR based upon newly
discovered evidence not available prior to the record’s closure.  
Concerning the remaining issue, the Judge’s findings that Applicant’s financial problems
were affected by a loss of employment; that she had settled or paid off all but one of the SOR debts;
that she had settled or paid off several non-SOR debts; and that she was making efforts to address
the remaining debt are sufficient to support a favorable whole-person analysis.  The Judge’s ultimate
decision is sustainable.  We need not agree with a Judge’s decision in order to find it sustainable.
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-05893 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2010).      
Order
The Judge’s favorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.

SEPARATE OPINION OF ADMINISTRATIVE JUDGE MICHAEL Y. RA’ANAN
This case puts us at the junction of different aspects of our jurisdiction.  The Board is not
prepared to conclude that the Judge erred in his analysis under Guideline F.  We do not have
authority to conduct de novo review.  Department Counsel’s motion to amend the SOR occurred
after the close of the record and the hearing.  The Judge denied Department Counsel’s motion two
months before issuing the decision in the case.  Department Counsel’s appeal brief does not
expressly challenge the Judge’s credibility determination outside the context of the SOR amendment
issue.  The language of the pertinent provision of the Directive appears to be permissive.  Although
the Directive’s language refers to the hearing as the context for such amendment, there are some
Appeal Board precedents which suggest that the SOR may be amended after the hearing .1  Also,
the Directive has general language granting the Judge the authority to make procedural rulings and
mandating that the Judge conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely and orderly manner.
In light of the foregoing, the Board is not in a position to reverse or remand, even if we may
differ with the Judge’s conclusions.  Of course, as the Judge noted, Department Counsel is free to
issue a new SOR addressing the issues raised in the motion to amend.
