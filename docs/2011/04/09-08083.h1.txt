Decision

O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based on a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant 
has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline for financial 
considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. 
  
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations 
Processing (e-QIP) signed on July 29, 2009, to request a security clearance 
required as part of his employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the 
results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary

2  
                                                     
affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant’s request.1 (Item 5) 
 
On September 14, 2010, DOHA issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) (Items 1, 2) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns 
addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). Applicant received the SOR on September 23, 
2010. (Item 3) He responded on October 26, 2010. (Item 4) He requested a 
decision without a hearing.  
 
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the ten allegations under 
Guideline F. Department Counsel forwarded to Applicant a file of relevant 
materials (FORM)2 dated November 23, 2010, in support of the Government’s 
preliminary decision to deny Applicant's request for a security clearance. 
Applicant received the file on December 16, 2010. He was given 30 days from 
the date he received the FORM to file a response. He timely submitted a reply 
dated January 14, 2011 (Reply). The case was assigned to me on February 1, 
2011, for an administrative decision based on the record. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After 
a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR and FORM, 
and the evidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional 
findings of fact. 
 
 Applicant, who is 60 years old, married in 1978, and has two children, 29 
and 32 years of age. He attended a community college from 1999 to 2001, but 
did not receive a degree. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1970 until he was 
honorably discharged in 1990. He held a security clearance during his military 
service. Among other awards, he received the meritorious service medal, 
commendation medal, achievement medal, humanitarian service medal, and 
national defense service medal. His commander noted, upon Applicant's 
retirement, that Applicant “set very high standards of excellence.” (Items 4, 5)  
 
 After Applicant retired from the military in 1990, he was unable to find 
employment at the rate he had been earning. He moved to another state where 
his wife was taking care of her ill mother. He held a part-time job from 1991 to 
1998, and a full-time job from 1996 to 1998. In 1998, he began employment with 
a defense contracting company as a Combat Readiness Coordinator/Instructor. 
In December 2010, he was offered a position as a Material Coordinator, to begin 
1 See Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. 
 
2 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) 
proffered in support of the Government’s case. 
 
 
 
3  
January 1, 2011. He was commended for his ”hard work and dedication” on the 
job in 2000 and 2001. His wife worked in a state government position from 1993 
to 2005, was unemployed for one year, and took a federal government position in 
2006. Applicant's son is autistic and lives at home, where Applicant supports him. 
Applicant helped his mother and grandmother financially starting in about 1990, 
until their deaths in 2009 and 2010. His daughter started college in 1997, and he 
has been helping with her school expenses. (Items 4, 6; Reply, pages 1, 13)  
 
 Applicant's financial problems began when he claimed too many 
exemptions on his federal and state tax returns after leaving the Air Force in 
1990. As a result, he was liable for large tax bills for tax years 1990 through 
1996. He also owed additional taxes in 2006, when his wife withdrew $40,000 
from her 401k; and in 2007, when he withdrew $1,200 from his 401k. He did not 
know he was required to include these amounts on his income tax returns. 
Interest and penalties over the years have increased the balances he owes. His 
state and federal debts have been paid primarily through the Government’s 
seizures of his refunds. In March 2010, he increased his withholding by $85 per 
month. In August 2010, the IRS informed him that he was subject to backup 
withholding, and that 28 percent of all dividends and interest would be withheld 
as of August 31, 2010. (Items 4, 6; Reply, page 10) 
 
 As of April 2010, Applicant’s net monthly pay was $4,729. His monthly 
expenses and debt payments total $4,142, leaving a monthly net remainder of 
$588. This amount does not include his wife’s income. In 2003, Applicant sought 
assistance from a debt consolidation service. He made payments for four months 
before deciding that the operation was fraudulent, and he discontinued the 
service. In 2007, Applicant took a vacation in the Bahamas. (Item 6) 
 
 The status of the SOR debts follows. 
 
• Judgment, $2,659 (allegation 1.a) – PAID. The debt relates to two bank 
loans Applicant opened in the mid-2000s. He did not make payments for 
several years. In 2008, the creditor filed suit against Applicant for the 
unpaid balance. Applicant stated in his 2010 Answer that he was not 
notified of the judgment. However, during his 2009 security interview, 
Applicant informed the agent that the creditor had sued him. He started a 
payment plan for $125 per month to be automatically deducted from his 
bank account. He submitted documentation showing the debt was paid in 
full in May 2010. (Items 4, 6, 7, 8; Reply, page 6) 
 
• State tax liens: (allegation 1.f, $1,603; allegation 1.h, $1,670) totaling 
$3,273 – PAID. Applicant owed back taxes to the state for several tax 
years. The state tax liens began in tax year 1990, and total about $6,000. 
He paid these deficiencies primarily through seizure of his refunds each

year.3 The August 2009 and March 2010 credit bureau reports (Items 6, 
8) show the lien for $1,603 (allegation 1.f) was released in 2007, and the 
lien in the amount of $1,670 (allegation 1.h) was released in 2003.4  
 
• IRS tax liens: $51,612 (allegations 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.i) – 
PAYMENT PLAN pending. Applicant has had payment plans in effect at 
various times with the IRS. He paid $200 per month via allotment from 
1991 to 1996. From 2008 to 2009, he paid $385 to $500 per month. He 
ended the payments in April 2009 so that he could make payments on a 
car. At the time of his September 2009 security interview, he planned to 
contact the IRS to set up a new payment plan. He stated that in 2007, the 
IRS informed him he owed $17,000 for tax years 1995 through 1999 and 
2002 through 2003. However, in his interrogatory response, he listed five 
tax liens that totaled $50,977. He contends that the $16,501 amount listed 
at allegation 1.i for tax year 1996 is actually the total amount owed for all 
tax years prior to 1996. He stated he was attempting to obtain a final full 
balance from the IRS. In the fall of 2010, he began a payment plan of 
$1,530 per month. He missed a payment, then made a payment of $800 in 
October 2010. In his January 2011 Reply, he stated he is working with the 
IRS on a revised installment amount because he had additional expenses 
for a car. He expected the new payment to be approximately $800 per 
month. (Items 4, 6; Reply) 
 
• Collection debt totaling $2,302 (allegation 1.j) – PAYMENT PLAN. 
This debt has been delinquent since 2007. Applicant contacted the 
creditor in May 2010 and set up a payment plan for $200 per month 
starting October 2010. In his January 2011 Reply, he estimated the debt 
would be paid in eight months (August 2011). He provided proof of a 
reduced balance of $1,902, with a hand-written note that the balance is 
$1,702. (Items 4, 8, Reply, page 12) 
 
Policies 
 
 Each security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and 
material information, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication 
policy in the AG.5 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in 
¶ 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the “whole-person” concept. 
3 Applicant mistakenly forwarded documentation showing payment of two state tax liens, but not 
the two listed in the SOR. (Item 6) 
 
4 The credit bureau reports list numerous state tax liens other than the two in the SOR, some of 
which were satisfied and some not. These other liens are not alleged and I will not consider them 
except in evaluating the Whole-Person factors. (Items 7, 8) 
 
5 Directive 6.3 
 
 
 
5  
                                                     
 
 The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does 
not determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific 
applicable guidelines are followed when a case can be measured against them 
as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to 
classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented 
by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative 
factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at AG ¶ 18. 
 
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the 
initial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the 
preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. 
Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in 
the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to 
refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s case.  
 
 Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a 
heavy burden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information 
enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and 
confidence. Therefore, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring 
each applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect 
the national interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national 
interest” standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an 
applicant’s suitability for access in favor of the Government.8 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 AG ¶ 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and 
meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of 
which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An 
individual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a 
concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. 
6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). 
 
7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. 
 
8 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
6  
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is 
also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially 
profitable criminal acts. 
 
 The evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG ¶19 (a) 
(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG ¶19 (c) (a history of not 
meeting financial obligations). The SOR alleges that Applicant owes more than 
$50,000. Applicant has paid three debts, which reduces the SOR debt by $4,932. 
Both Applicant's federal and state tax debts have been accruing since 1990. 
Applicant's history demonstrates a failure to meet his financial obligations. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the 
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Applicant's debts have been accruing since 1990, more than 20 years. But 
they are not in the distant past, as most of the federal tax debt remains unpaid. 
His inconsistent efforts in relation to these debts indicate that delinquencies may 
continue or recur in the future, and raise questions as to his reliability and 
judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) focuses on situations where conditions beyond an applicant’s 
control affect his ability to meet his financial obligations. Applicant notes that he 
went through a long period of low-paid and temporary employment after he 
retired from the Air Force in 1990, lasting until he gained full-time employment in 
1998. This circumstance can be considered an event beyond Applicant's control. 
However, he has been steadily employed since 1998. Applicant’s low-paid work 
occurred 13 years ago, and he has been steadily employed since then. He has 
had sufficient time to have made a sustained effort to pay the IRS. Moreover, 
Applicant chose to take funds from his own and his wife’s 401k accounts in 2006 
 
 
7  
and 2007 that resulted in an increased tax liability; he chose to vacation in the 
Bahamas in 2007 while he owed significant amounts to the Government; and he 
chose to stop his IRS payments in 2009 to pay on his car loan instead. Mitigation 
is not available under AG ¶ 20(b).  
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant paid the 
two state tax liens several years ago, but most of his tax liens have been paid 
through seizure of his refunds rather than through his own efforts. Although he 
paid the collection account listed at allegation 1.a, he admitted that he failed to 
make payments for several years, and the creditor finally filed a judgment against 
him. He has a payment plan in place for the debt at 1.j, and has reduced the 
balance by $600. However, he started that payment plan in 2010, on a debt that 
has been delinquent since 2007. By far the largest debt is owed to the federal 
government. Applicant has made intermittent efforts to pay the federal tax liens. 
However, the back taxes have been due since 1990, and after more than 20 
years, he is still trying to work out a plan to pay them. As of the date of his Reply 
in January 2011, his payment amount was uncertain, as he had asked the IRS to 
reduce it by half. Only partial mitigation is available under AG ¶ 20(d). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate 
an applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented 
and have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I 
have also reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the 
extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or 
absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; 
(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the 
appropriate guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. 
 
 Applicant has demonstrated character dealing with issues in his personal 
life including a child with special needs, and a mother and grandmother who 
 
 
8  
needed financial assistance in their last years. He served his country honorably 
for 20 years in the Air Force. He has received numerous military medals and his 
supervisors laud his hard work and dedication.  
 
 However, other record evidence raises security concerns. Applicant is a 
mature adult with years of experience in the work world, and presumably, an 
understanding of the way in which the federal and state tax systems operate. Yet 
despite having income from steady employment for the past 13 years, he failed 
to consistently meet those obligations over two decades. It is difficult to 
understand how he could have made the same mistake in under-withholding year 
after year. His lack of diligence about his obligations to the state and federal 
governments is a serious concern. He had numerous state tax liens that were 
paid not through his own efforts, but primarily through seizure of his refunds. He 
owes a large debt to the federal government, and has let his unpaid taxes mount 
and accrue interest charges and penalties. He has been in contact with the IRS 
over the years, and admits that the personnel there have been willing to work 
with him. Yet, after 20 years, he is still working out a payment plan for the bulk of 
the federal taxes. Applicant’s recent efforts are likely a response to the security 
process. His sporadic efforts in relation to the IRS debt do not demonstrate 
reliability and good judgment.  
 
A fair and commonsense assessment of the available information shows 
that Applicant has not satisfied the doubts raised about his suitability for a 
security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the 
security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by 
section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST Applicant 
 
 Subparagraph 1.a – 1.j:    Against Applicant  
  
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant’s request for 
a security clearance is denied.
