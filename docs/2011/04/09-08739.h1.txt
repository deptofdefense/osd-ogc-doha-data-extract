MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant defaulted on her student loans, and she had a car repossessed when she 
could no longer afford the payments. She has paid about $1,525 toward her old debts and 
her $3,436 income tax refund was applied to her student loan debt. Since June 2010, she 
has had an action plan to address her debt, and she is likely to continue to resolve her debt 
to improve her credit score. Concerns that she deliberately falsified her security clearance 
application were not established. Clearance granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 6, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, which provided the basis for 
its preliminary decision to deny her a security clearance and to refer the matter to an 
administrative judge. DOHA took action under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
 
 
 2 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) 
effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR allegations on April 28, 2010, and requested a 
hearing. On May 14, 2010, the Government amended SOR 2.a under Guideline E to 
correct the date of the security clearance application that Applicant allegedly falsified, and 
to delete the alleged falsification of question 26.m. Applicant answered the amended 
allegation on June 3, 2010. On June 28, 2010, the case was assigned to me to conduct a 
hearing and to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On July 2, 2010, I scheduled a hearing for 
July 21, 2010. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. Five Government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and nine 
Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-I) were admitted without objection. Applicant also testified, as 
reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on July 30, 2010. 
 
Procedural Rulings 
 
Due to the delay in issuing the decision in this case because of my workload, I 
reopened the record on March 9, 2011, for Applicant to update the financial record. As of 
July 2010, Applicant had established an action plan to address her debts, and she was 
looking to reduce her living expenses. In December 2010, she notified me of a change in 
her address. Out of concern that the financial information for review was dated and may 
not be accurate, I sua sponte gave Applicant a deadline of March 25, 2011, to submit 
additional evidence. Applicant timely offered six potential exhibits (Ex. J-O), which were 
admitted without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
In the amended SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, 
that Applicant owed delinquent debt totaling $17,631 to nine creditors as of April 2010 
(SOR 1.a-1.i). Under Guideline E, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified a July 
30, 2009 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by not disclosing 
the debt in SOR 1.f in response to question 26.n concerning any debts then over 90 days 
delinquent. When she answered the allegations, Applicant admitted the debts in the SOR, 
with the exception of SOR 1.f, which she believed was a duplicate debt of the student loan 
in SOR 1.g; and 1.h, which had been paid. Applicant indicated that debts in SOR 1.a 
through 1.e and 1.i were in a debt consolidation plan and that she was paying $50 a month 
on the student loan debt in SOR 1.g. Applicant denied that she intentionally falsified her e-
QIP. After considering the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings 
of fact. 
 
Applicant is a 29-year-old single mother with an 11-year-old daughter and a seven-
year-old son. Since July 2009, she has worked as a microwave assembler for a defense 
contractor. (Ex. 1.) Applicant was granted an interim clearance and supported the 
production of a classified system for about eight months. As of July 2010, she had been 
 
 3 
assigned to unclassified duties pending final adjudication of her security clearance 
eligibility. (Tr. 39.) 
 
Applicant did not finish high school but earned her graduate equivalency diploma 
(GED). (Tr. 40.) She lived in subsidized housing from 2000 to 2008. (Ex. 1.) In April 2000, 
Applicant started working in the electronics field doing “die mount” work. In March 2001, 
she was laid off from her employment. Applicant was placed by a temporary agency as a 
proof operator at a bank for the next 2.5 years while raising her young daughter. Applicant 
had no benefits in her job. (Tr. 40.) Applicant stopped paying on a natural gas debt of $489 
in May 2003. Moreover, although not alleged, her August 2009 credit report (Ex. 3.) reflects 
a $1,218 judgment against her in December 2003 due to nonpayment of a credit card 
account since October 2002. 
 
From August 2003 to June 2004, Applicant worked as a solderer in the electronics 
industry. In June 2004, Applicant became a full employee of a micro-semiconductor 
company. She had benefits, but her hourly wage was only around $11. (Tr. 78.) While 
working full-time, Applicant enrolled in a technical school in September 2004. (Ex. 1.) She 
took out federally-guaranteed student loans of $2,625 and $4,000 (SOR 1.g). Around 
February 2005, unbeknownst to Applicant, the school assessed a tuition debt of $2,789 
(SOR 1.f). (Ex. 2; 3.) Apparently, financial aid did not cover the cost because she failed to 
complete the course of study. (Tr. 56.) On April 19, 2005, Applicant paid $1,078.86 to settle 
the judgment debt from December 2003. (Ex. 2.) 
 
In November 2007, Applicant took out a loan of $9,000 for a 2000 model-year car. 
She fell behind in her $240 monthly payments in late summer 2008 (SOR 1.e), but caught 
up after she acquired a higher-paying job. (Ex. 3.) In October 2008, Applicant left her job, 
which was then paying her $12 an hour (Tr. 60.), for a temporary placement at an 
engineering company at around $20 an hour. (Tr. 40.) She returned her rent subsidy 
because she felt she no longer needed it.
1
 (Tr. 62.) While it was the highest paying job that 
she had held to that point, she had no benefits. (Tr. 40.) 
 
In July 2009, Applicant began working for her defense contractor employer at 
around $21 an hour with benefits. (Tr. 40.) On July 30, 2009, she completed an e-QIP on 
which she responded negatively to all the financial record inquiries, including 26.n, “Are you 
currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?” while adding that she had a student 
loan (SOR 1.g) that was in deferment. (Ex. 1.) 
 
A check of Applicant‟s credit on August 6, 2009, revealed some delinquent debts, 
including accounts charged off or placed for collection (SOR 1.a-1.d, 1.h-1.i). Her 
educational debts were listed as deferred but also as late over 120 days on balances of 
$2,789 (SOR 1.f) and $3,753 (SOR 1.g). Her credit report had not been updated to show 
the settlement of the December 2003 judgment debt. (Ex. 2; 3.) 
On October 8, 2009, an authorized investigator for the Government interviewed 
Applicant about her undisclosed delinquencies. Applicant explained that she failed to report 
                                                 
1
Her rent was $850 per month from April 2008 until December 2010 when she moved.  (Tr.62-63.) No 
information was presented about the extent of the rent subsidies she received. 
 
 4 
debts because most of them were incurred more than seven years ago. Applicant was 
unable to provide any information regarding the accounts except the judgment, which she 
had paid and the student loans in SOR 1.g, which she indicated had become past due but 
she had resumed repayment. Applicant related that she would contact the other creditors 
listed on her credit record and attempt to resolve the debts. (Ex. 2.) After her interview, 
Applicant made some effort to reach her creditors without success. (Ex. 3.) She stopped 
paying on her car loan because she could not keep up with the cost of repairs, and the 
vehicle was repossessed (SOR 1.e).
2
 (Tr. 54.) 
 
As of January 12, 2010, Applicant owed $3,798 on the student loans in SOR 1.g. 
She had made no payments on the tuition debt owed the school (SOR 1.h) because she 
was unaware that she owed a separate debt. (Tr. 69.) Equifax was also reporting collection 
balances on several accounts: SOR 1.b-1.d and two telephone debts not in the SOR of 
$521 and $321. (Ex. 4.) In response to an inquiry from DOHA about efforts to address her 
delinquent debts, Applicant turned to her employer for help. With guidance from a financial 
counselor affiliated with the company‟s employee assistance program, Applicant filed 
online disputes with the credit bureaus on several of the debts in the SOR to obtain 
information about the accounts. (Ex. 2; 5; Tr. 48.) 
 
On January 26, 2010, Applicant was notified that her student loans in SOR 1.g could 
be rehabilitated if she made nine consecutive monthly payments. Subsequently, she made 
a first payment of $50 on February 7, 2010. (Ex. 2; H.) She verified that her auto loan for 
the repossessed vehicle had an active collection balance of $2,656.67 (SOR 1.e). She put 
a fraud alert on her credit record because of the $521 wireless telephone debt that she did 
not recognize, and she disputed the tuition debt in SOR 1.f because she thought it was a 
duplicate of SOR 1.g. (Tr. 43.) She settled the $321 telephone debt for $50. After energy 
assistance payments on her natural gas account totaling $370 in 2008, she owed a 
$3,518.45 past-due balance. She paid $100 toward the debt in SOR 1.i on February 7, 
2010. (Ex. 2.) 
 
On February 12, 2010, Applicant gave DOHA evidence of those payments. She 
indicated that she was looking into consolidating her remaining debt subject to its 
verification. Applicant attributed her omission of the debts from her e-QIP to not having any 
financial information with her when she completed the application, and not knowing that 
she had outstanding debts that would have any consequences for her employment. 
Applicant expressed her appreciation for the check of her credit because she had been 
unaware that she could dispute or fix her credit. Although she was not receiving any child 
support, she estimated she still had a net monthly remainder of $299. (Ex. 2.) 
 
On April 28, 2010, a debt consolidation firm proposed a plan to resolve her non-
student loan debt totaling $11,728 at $193.47 per month after a $658.54 down-payment, to 
be paid in two installments. (Ex. G.) She made no payment on the student loan in SOR 1.g 
because she needed to figure out how she could pay both the student loan and debt 
consolidation expense. (Tr. 57.) When the online debt consolidation firm failed to collect 
                                                 
2 
Applicant testified that she turned in the car in 2009 because it had become too expensive to maintain. (Tr. 
54.) However, as of January 2010 Equifax was reporting the debt as an involuntary repossession. (Ex. 5.) 
 
 5 
her first payment, Applicant went to a local community center for advice. A financial 
counselor advised her to pay the debts on her own. (Tr. 42.) After reviewing Applicant‟s 
credit report with her (Ex. A.), the financial counselor proposed a credit counseling program 
action plan to Applicant on June 29, 2010. (Ex. B; Tr. 42-43.) Under the plan, Applicant 
was to make repayment or settlement arrangements on the debts identified in SOR 1.b 
(credit card), 1.e (car loan), 1.f (tuition), 1.g (student loan), and 1.i (natural gas), and a 
$466.81 electric bill (not alleged). Since the $321 telephone bill (not alleged) had been paid 
but still appeared on her credit report, Applicant planned to request a receipt confirming 
satisfaction. (Ex. B.) 
 
Effective with the school year starting September 2010, Applicant enrolled her 
daughter in the local public school system. (Ex. L; Tr. 80.) Her daughter had previously 
attended parochial school for two years at a tuition cost to Applicant of $217 per month 
plus transportation. (Ex. J; Tr.  79.) Applicant worked at the school at night on Friday 
evenings in return for reduced tuition. (Tr. 80.) In December 2010, Applicant moved to an 
apartment at a monthly rent of $990, inclusive of heating costs, which had been averaging 
$350 per month. (Ex. J.)  
 
 On February 4, 2011, Applicant‟s federal income tax refund of $3,436 was 
intercepted and applied to the student loan debt (SOR 1.g), reducing the balance to 
$523.16. As of March 2011, Applicant had made some progress in resolving debts under 
the action plan, while other debts were still pending repayment arrangements (Ex. O.), as 
set forth in the following table.

 On November 5, 2010, Applicant met with the financial counselor to review her 
progress in addressing her debts through the action plan. (Ex. K.) After reviewing 
Applicant‟s latest credit report, the financial counselor indicated on March 22, 2011, that 
she needed to see more improvement in Applicant‟s credit score. (Ex. M.) On March 25, 
2011, Applicant met with the counselor. Applicant was again directed to set up repayment 
plans with her remaining creditors. (Ex. O.) 
 
 The father of Applicant‟s children is not paying court-ordered child support at $58 
weekly on a regular basis. Applicant testified that he claims he is unemployed, although 
she knows otherwise. (Tr. 71-73.) However, the state sent her $3,000 in early 2010 that 
they had taken from the father of her children. She used the funds to pay her daughter‟s 
school tuition for the 2009-2010 school year. (Tr. 79.) 
 
 With merit increase in her pay effective February 19, 2011, and a reclassification of 
her position on March 5, 2011, Applicant‟s annual base pay is $46,628 ($22.41 per hour). 
(Ex. J; N.) As of March 2011, Applicant was averaging about six hours of overtime per 
week. (Ex. J.) She had reduced her monthly living expenses by about $527 per month, 
from $1,617 to $1,090, by moving and enrolling her daughter in public school. (Ex. J.) She 
drives a 2001 model-year vehicle that she bought outright for $1,000. (Tr. 54.) Applicant 
does not have any daycare costs at present because her mother cares for her son. (Tr. 
70.)  
 
 Applicant has been an ethical, talented assembler since she started with her current 
employer. Because of her dedication and professionalism, several supervisors have 
requested that Applicant be assigned to their team. Former and current managers have not 
witnessed any conduct on Applicant‟s part that would lead them to question her honesty or 
commitment to her team. Applicant has been forthcoming when issues arise on the 
manufacturing line, and has been willing to seek out resolution and clarification. She works 
overtime when asked and is considered a valuable employee by her coworkers and 
managers. (Ex. C-F.) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a „right‟ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
 
 8 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant‟s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant‟s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge‟s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified 
information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive 
Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 
12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive 
information). 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern about finances is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one‟s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
 
 9 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is 
at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
 
Applicant defaulted on her school loans (SOR 1.g), and she was left with an 
additional bill from the school of $2,789 (SOR 1.f) when she failed to complete the 
program. She was late 30 days several times on her automobile loan (SOR 1.e) starting in 
late summer 2008, and the vehicle was repossessed in 2009. Over the years, Applicant 
incurred natural gas charges of almost $3,500 that she was unable to pay (SOR 1.h and 
1.i). More recently, she had trouble paying her electric bill as well. At least one credit card 
account became seriously delinquent in the amount of $585 (SOR 1.b); although her credit 
records also show an even larger $2,466 unpaid balance on a Visa account (SOR 1.c) that 
she does not recognize and disputes on that basis. And although not alleged in the SOR, 
$321 in telephone charges from September 2005, and $416 in electric utility charges were 
in collection as of May 2009. AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations,” 
applies. AG ¶ 19(a), “inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,” is also implicated in that 
she did not have the funds to make timely payments on those obligations. 
 
Concerning potential factors in mitigation, AG ¶ 20(a), “the behavior happened so 
long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to 
recur and does not cast doubt on the individual‟s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment,” cannot reasonably apply because her financial difficulties are recent and 
ongoing in the sense that she has to prioritize repayment and cannot satisfy them in lump 
sums. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person‟s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected 
medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances,” applies in part. Heating and electric utility expenses are not 
discretionary, and from June 2004 to October 2008, her hourly wage was only $11 to $12. 
Low wages, while not an unexpected circumstance, explain her falling behind on the 
satellite television debt, the credit card debt in SOR 1.b, and the utility debts. Also, the 
failure of her children‟s father to pay his court-mandated child support is not within her 
control. But it is difficult to give full mitigating weight to AG ¶ 20(b) where other debts 
became seriously delinquent (car loan, student loan in SOR 1.g) in 2009, when she was 
earning over $20 an hour. Furthermore, her decision to send her daughter to parochial 
school for two years from September 2008 to June 2010, even at reduced tuition, is difficult 
to justify from a financial standpoint, even if it is understandable that she would want the 
best education for her child. While she was apparently unaware of most of the debts on her 
credit record as of her e-QIP (including the debt owed the technical school), she knew she 
was struggling to pay her gas bill, as she received public assistance to cover part of the 
expense in 2008. She also had to have known that she was going to have to resume 
paying her student loans in SOR 1.g once the deferment ended. As for the other debts that 
Applicant believed she no longer owed, her failure to keep herself up to date on the status 
of her debts raises concerns about her financial judgment that are not mitigated by AG ¶ 
20(b). 
 
 
 10 
In her favor, Applicant began looking into her debts once they were brought to her 
attention as an issue for her security clearance. Following her interview, she attempted to 
contact her creditors, albeit without much success. She then turned to her employer for 
help. With guidance from a financial counselor affiliated with the company‟s employee 
assistance program, Applicant filed online disputes with the credit bureaus on several of 
the debts in the SOR just to obtain information about the accounts. Her inquiry into 
rehabilitating her defaulted student loan led her to make a first payment of $50 in February 
2010. Although she did not continue with the program, she testified credibly that she 
needed to figure out how she could afford to pay both the student loan and the debt 
consolidation fee. When her first payment was not accepted by the online debt 
consolidation firm, Applicant sought the advice of a financial counselor affiliated with a 
community assistance organization. As of her hearing in July 2010, Applicant had 
established an action plan, but had done little to implement it. 
 
In light of her expressed intent to follow the plan and her previous efforts to address 
her debts, she was given an opportunity to demonstrate her commitment to resolving her 
debts and to lower her living expenses. As of March 2011, she had paid about $1,525 to 
her creditors. Also, by then, her income tax refund had been applied to her student loan 
debt. While interception of her tax refund does not implicate AG ¶ 20(d), “the individual 
initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” her 
payments are evidence of her intent to resolve her past-due debts. AG ¶ 20(d) applies. 
 
Applicant also demonstrated credible steps taken to improve her financial situation. 
She moved in December 2010 to an apartment at higher rent, from $850 to $990 per 
month, but heating costs are included so at least during the winter months, her living costs 
are lower. More significantly, she indicated in July 2010 that her daughter would no longer 
be attending private school because she could not afford it. As confirmed in Exhibit L, her 
daughter is enrolled in the public school system. Applicant has not incurred any new credit 
card debt and is managing to pay her monthly expenses. Yet, the latest update to 
Applicant‟s action plan shows that she has yet to reach repayment arrangements on some 
of her larger debts, most notably the school tuition debt (SOR 1.f), the gas debt (SOR 1.i), 
and the auto loan (SOR 1.e). The financial counselor wants to see more progress in this 
regard. While it would be premature to fully mitigate the financial concerns under AG ¶ 
20(c), “the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,” Applicant is likely to 
continue to address her debts if given the opportunity to earn the income needed. With a 
recent increase in her hourly wage, she is in a better position financially to address these 
debts than she has been in the past. 
 
AG ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to 
substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,” 
has only limited applicability. Applicant successfully disputed a $521 wireless telephone 
debt that was not alleged in the SOR. While she admitted the credit card debt in SOR 1.c 
and the collection debt in SOR 1.d when she answered the SOR, she does not recognize 
those debts and filed online disputes. The Visa debt reportedly in collection does not 
appear on her recent credit reports, and verification of the collection account in SOR 1.d is 
 
 11 
still pending. Also, the Government conceded at the hearing that the gas debt in SOR 1.h 
was covered in substantial part by the public assistance payments, and that Applicant‟s 
debt to the gas company is covered in SOR 1.i. AG ¶ 20(e) applies to the debts in SOR 
1.c, 1.d, and 1.h in that the evidence falls short of establishing Applicant‟s liability for those 
purported debts. Concerning SOR 1.a, Applicant has been unable to reach the creditor, 
although given she admits that she had a satellite television account at one time, the debt 
may well be valid. Even so, she is likely to pay it if shown to be legitimate. With due regard 
to Applicant‟s limited income before October 2008, her ongoing support of two minor 
children as a single parent without regular child support income, and her efforts to address 
her debts since late 2009, the financial issues that persist do not now raise such concerns 
to warrant denial of her security clearance eligibility. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
 The security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about 
an individual‟s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified 
information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid 
answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to 
cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
Applicant did not disclose any financial delinquencies on her July 2009 e-QIP. While 
she listed her student loan debt in SOR 1.g, she indicated it was deferred. Applicant‟s 
August 2009 credit report (Ex. 3) lists not only the disputed debts in SOR 1.c and 1.d as 
being in collection, but also the natural gas debt in SOR 1.i, and the $321 telephone debt 
(not alleged), neither of which Applicant disputes. She was reportedly late over 120 days 
on the credit card debt in SOR 1.b. Applicant nonetheless denies intentional falsification, 
contending that she was unaware of her delinquent debts when she completed her security 
clearance application. Accordingly the Government has the burden of establishing the 
applicability of AG ¶ 16(a): 
 
Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any 
personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form 
used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award 
benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, 
or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
A finding of intentional falsification can be inferred from omission of information that on its 
face should have been reported. Clearly, the debts in SOR 1.b and 1.i should have been 
reported in response to question 26.n, “Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any 
debt(s)?” However, Applicant also indicated that she was largely unaware of what was on 
her credit record at the time. She was focused on her student loan debt, which she 
believed was deferred. Her August 2009 credit report confirms that Applicant‟s auto loan 
had not been over 90 days delinquent, and her student loan debt in SOR 1.g was 
considered current and in deferment by the current holder of the loan account, even though 
 
 12 
she had been late in her payments in the past. Applicant‟s failure to remain apprised of her 
debt situation bears implications for her handling of her finances, but it also shows that she 
lacked the intent to conceal required under AG ¶ 16(a). Accordingly, the Personal Conduct 
concern was not established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant‟s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct and 
all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 
2(a).
3
 Applicant was 18 years old when she had her first child. She began working full-time 
three months after her daughter‟s birth, and while she received public housing assistance, 
she has been the sole financial support for herself and her children. Efforts to improve her 
employment prospects through some technical training left her with student loan debt when 
her hourly wage was between $11 and $12. Wanting the best for her daughter, she 
enrolled her in parochial school. While that decision is difficult to justify given her limited 
income and failure of her children‟s father to pay his child support, Applicant worked Friday 
nights at the school in return for reduced tuition. The same dedication to a better future for 
herself and her children is evident in her commitment to excellence at work. Project 
managers and supervisors attest to her services being requested by several teams 
because of the quality of her work. Her contributions to her defense contractor employer 
are not mitigating of the mismanagement of her personal finances, but they are indicative 
of her good character. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “„meaningful track record‟ necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that [she] has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrates that [she] has „. . . established a plan to resolve [her] financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.‟ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant‟s financial situation and 
[her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant‟s plan for the 
reduction of [her] outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) („Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a 
                                                 
3
The adjudicative process requires assessment of the following factors: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual‟s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is 
voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) 
the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) 
the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 13 
determination.‟) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on 
all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. 
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
Applicant is not incurring any new credit card delinquencies. She has a plan in place to 
address her debts. She probably should have made more progress addressing her 
remaining debts after her hearing in July 2010. Yet, she did take significant steps to reduce 
her monthly expenses, including enrolling her daughter in public school. She has continued 
to meet with the financial counselor, and her debt at this point appears manageable. I am 
confident that she will continue to resolve her delinquent debt. Evidence of her good 
character indicates that she is not likely to engage in illegal acts that could jeopardize the 
employment that she needs to provide for her two young children. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the amended 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.g:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:  For Applicant 
 
  Paragraph 2, Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT

Conclusion 
 
In light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
