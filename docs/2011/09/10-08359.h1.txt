Decision
______________
LAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge
Except for having his wages garnished to satisfy two delinquent creditors, Applicant
has done nothing to resolve the almost $45,000 in delinquent debt listed in his credit
reports. Clearance is denied.  
On February 22, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued
a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1
The SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant
submitted a response to the SOR that was received by DOHA on March 28, 2011, in which
he requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing. Applicant admitted
all SOR allegations except those contained in subparagraphs 1.c, 1.m, and 1.p.
Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 7, 2011,
that was mailed to Applicant on June 10, 2011. Applicant was informed he had 30 days

from receipt of the FORM to submit his objections to any information contained in the
FORM or to submit any additional information he wished to be considered. Applicant
acknowledged receipt of the FORM on July 7, 2011, but did not submit a response to the
FORM or object to anything contained in the FORM within the time allowed him. The case
was assigned to me on August 29, 2011.
Findings of Fact
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,
after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 36 years old. He has been employed as a field service representative
by a defense contractor since February 2002. He was previously employed as a data entry
clerk from February 2007 until February 2008, and as a material coordinator from April
2006 until January 2007 by different defense contractors. Applicant served on active duty
in the Army from January 1993 until he was honorably discharged in April 2006. 
Applicant was first married in February 1997. That marriage ended by divorce in
February 2006. Applicant has been remarried since June 2009. The record does not
indicate that he has any children. 
Applicant’s credit report indicates he has four delinquent student loans totaling
$15,865. The credit report also lists four delinquent credit card debts totaling $8,182, two
overdrawn checking accounts from two separate banks totaling $1,173, and a personal
payday loan delinquent in the amount of $1,330. Applicant has a delinquent debt, owed in
the amount of $5,444, that arose from a broken lease. These accounts have all either been
submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts. Applicant admits that he is liable for
each of these debts. No payment has been made on any of these debts.
Applicant denies that he is liable for the two delinquent cellular phone debts, totaling
$399, or the delinquent utility debt, owed in the amount of $92, that are listed in his credit
report. He did not submit any verification that he is not liable for these debts or any proof
that he has done anything to dispute his liability for these debts. No payment has been
made on any of these debts. 
Applicant joined the Army National Guard after he was discharged from active duty.
He was paid a $10,000 enlistment bonus that was required to be repaid when Applicant
left the Guard rather than be deployed. He also obtained a $3,000 GI Bill student payment
that was required to be repaid when he dropped out of college. Both debts are now
delinquent and Applicant’s wages are being garnished to repay these debts.  
 
Applicant attributes the delinquent debt owed in the amount of $5,444 for a broken
lease to his divorce and his need to vacate the apartment where he and his wife lived
because he could not continue to afford the rent. He attributes the remaining delinquent
debt to a lack of income and bad choices with his credit.

Policies
The Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a
person’s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying
conditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Each clearance decision
must be a fair and impartial decision based upon the relevant and material facts and
circumstances, the whole-person concept, and the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6
of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or
against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be
followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the
evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial considerations), with its disqualifying and
mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. 
  
The sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an
applicant.  The Government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of2 3
proof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,4
although the Government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden
of proof.  “Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of5
the evidence.”  Once the Government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant6
to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against
him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable7
clearance decision.8
No one has a right to a security clearance  and “the clearly consistent standard9
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access10
to classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      11

Analysis
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability,
trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. . . .
(Adjudicative Guideline [AG] 18)
Applicant has 17 delinquent accounts that have either been submitted for collection
or charged off as bad debts. The total owed on those accounts in $44,643. Except for the
Government garnishing Applicant’s wages to recoup the $12,158 owed to it, no payment
has been made on any of the delinquent accounts. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a):
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and DC 19C(c): a history of not meeting financial
obligations apply.
Applicant attributes the majority of his delinquent debt to a lack of income and bad
choices with his credit. However, he listed continuous employment from 1993 to the
present in the security clearance application he submitted. He attributes the delinquent
charge from a broken lease to his divorce in 2006. However he did not provide any
information to indicate he acted responsibly in connection with that debt. Instead, he
apparently just vacated the apartment despite having six months remaining on the lease
he had signed. He denies he is liable for three of the delinquent accounts, but he failed to
provide any evidence to support those denials or any evidence that he has disputed those
accounts. I have considered all potential mitigating conditions and conclude none apply.
Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,
the whole-person concept, the factors listed in ¶ 6.3.1 through ¶ 6.3.6 of the Directive, and
the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has failed to mitigate
the financial considerations security concern. He has not overcome the case against him
nor satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Guideline F is decided against Applicant.
Formal Findings
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT
Subparagraphs 1.a-q: Against Applicant
5
Conclusion
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.
Clearance is denied.
