GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is 
denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 20, 2010, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application (SF 86).1 On February 2, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued her a set of interrogatories. She responded to the 
interrogatories on March 6, 2011.2
                                                          
1 Item 5 (SF 86), dated January 20, 2010. 
 On April 15, 2011, DOHA issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department 
of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative 
 
2 Item 6 (Applicant’s Answers to Interrogatories, dated March 6, 2011).

Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December 
29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the 
Directive, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not 
make a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 21, 2011. In a sworn 
statement, dated May 5, 2011,3
 
 Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and 
elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete 
copy of the Government’s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on 
June 2, 2011, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days after 
receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or 
mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on June 14, 2011, and any response was due 
on July 14, 2011. She apparently chose not to submit any additional documentation, as 
none was received by the due date. The case was assigned to me on August 29, 2011. 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations 
pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.k.) of the SOR. Those 
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough 
review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the 
following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as 
management analyst II,4 and she is seeking to retain a security clearance, the level of 
which has not been described. She previously had a security clearance with access to 
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) since August 1994.5 She has never served 
in the U.S. military.6 She is a May 1975 high school graduate.7 In early 1997, Applicant 
was employed by a company, earning about $14 per hour, when she was laid off.8 She 
joined her current employer in July 1997,9

also worked part-time with another employer.10 Applicant was married in May 1984,11 
separated in 1997,12 and divorced in June 2009.13 She has one child of that marriage, a 
son born in August 1989.14 Applicant has resided with her fiancé since June 1999.15
 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties in 1997, as 
a result of a combination of circumstances. She lost her job, was recently separated 
from her husband, and was only receiving $350 in monthly child support to support their 
son.16 In February 1997, a foreclosure action was filed against Applicant’s property in 
the state court.17 The foreclosure was granted in January 1998, and possession of the 
property was awarded to the plaintiff.18
 
  
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): In March 1998, a summons was issued against Applicant charging 
her with two counts of uttering a bad or non-sufficient funds check under $300.00. In 
April 1998, another summons was issued against her charging her with an additional 
count of uttering a bad or non-sufficient funds check under $300.00.19 In October 1999, 
another summons was issued against Applicant charging her with two additional counts 
of uttering a bad or non-sufficient funds check under $300.00.20 Applicant 
acknowledged issuing the checks, but denied that her actions were intentional.21
 
 The 
disposition of the cases has not been described. She claimed she made her checks 
“good” when she learned of them, but has offered no documentary evidence, such as 
receipts or cancelled checks, to support her claim.

duration of her period of unemployment; whether she had received any unemployment compensation, and if so, how 
much and for how long; when she separated from her husband; and when she fell behind in her monthly mortgage 
payments.

(SOR ¶ 1.c.): In July 2007, Applicant financed the purchase of a residence with a 
mortgage loan in the amount of $262,140.22 In late 2009, Applicant fell behind in her 
monthly mortgage payments, and by February 2010, the account was 90 days past 
due.23 The history of the events furnished by Applicant is somewhat confusing, for she 
claimed she obtained a mortgage modification when her monthly payment increased 
from $1,591 to $1,941; did the modification for three months at $1,641 per month; and 
then her monthly payment increased to $2,300.24 Applicant has offered no documentary 
evidence regarding the mortgage modification process and purported results. Applicant 
indicated an inability to afford any monthly payment in excess of $1,300, claiming that 
she had to support her son’s college expenses without any financial assistance from her 
ex-husband.25 In June 2010, a foreclosure action was filed against Applicant’s property 
in the state court.26 The foreclosure was granted and the property was sold at auction in 
September 2010.27 As of May 2011, Applicant was still residing in the residence, and 
indicated she would be “vacating the premises soon.”28
 
  
(SOR ¶ 1.d.): Applicant had a retail store charge account which she claimed she 
opened in 2009.29 In fact, the account was opened in May 2008.30 She used the 
account to purchase Christmas gifts.31 The high credit was $3,000, and as of February 
2010, the balance was $1,319, with a past due amount of $160.32 Applicant 
acknowledged the account became delinquent when she had to pay for her son’s 
college expenses rather than paying this individual account.33 The balance was charged 
off in December 2010.34 Applicant indicated she would pay off the account in March 
2010.35

process of making monthly payments,36
 
 but has offered no documentary evidence, such 
as receipts or cancelled checks, to support her contention. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): There is a department store charge account which was opened in 
December 2007. She used the account to purchase household items.37 The account 
became $660 delinquent in December 2009, when it was closed and charged off.38 
Applicant acknowledged the account became delinquent when she had to pay for her 
son’s college expenses rather than paying this individual account.39 Applicant indicated 
she would pay off the account in April 2010.40 Applicant entered into a repayment 
agreement with the creditor in March 2011, and, commencing March 8, 2011, was to 
make monthly payments of $55 for 11 months and one payment of $55.13.41 She has 
offered no documentary evidence, such as receipts or cancelled checks, to support her 
contention that timely payments have been made since March 2011.42
 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): There is a department store charge account which was opened in 
November 2007. Applicant purchased Christmas gifts using the card.43 The account 
became delinquent with $266 past due on an $818 balance in July 2009, when it was 
closed by the credit grantor.44 Applicant acknowledged the account became delinquent 
when she had to pay for her son’s college expenses rather than paying this individual 
account.45 The account was eventually sold or transferred to a collection agency. In 
March 2011, Applicant called the collection agency and set up repayment 
arrangements.46 Under the agreement, commencing March 8, 2011, she was to make 
monthly payments of $84.69 through a “check by phone system” for 12 months.47 The 
first payment was received on March 8, 2011, as confirmed by the collection agency,48

checks, to support her contention that timely payments have been made continuously 
since March 2011. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): There is a bank credit card account which was opened in October 
2008. Applicant purchased tires for her automobile using the card.49 The account 
became delinquent with $96 past due on a $3,328 balance in July 2009, when it was 
closed by the credit grantor.50 Applicant acknowledged the account became delinquent 
when she had to pay for her son’s college expenses rather than paying this individual 
account.51 The account was eventually sold or transferred to a collection agency, and 
the balance increased to $3,610.52 Applicant initially contended that she paid of the 
account, and that as of February 2010, it had a zero balance.53 She subsequently 
altered her position, and now contends she has started making monthly payments to the 
collection agency. It is unclear if the payments are under an agreed repayment plan 
approved by the collection agency. She submitted documentary evidence of one 
payment, in the amount of $150.41, made to that collection agency on March 10, 
2011.54
 
 Applicant has offered no documentary evidence, such as receipts or cancelled 
checks, to support her recent contention that timely payments have been made 
continuously since March 2011. 
(SOR ¶ 1.h.): Applicant obtained a $10,998 student loan for her son through a 
bank in September  2007.55 By December 2009, the loan was reported as deferred with 
$1,566 past due 180 days.56 The bank subsequently changed its name. The account 
was placed for collection with an education loan collection agency, and by January 
2011, the past due balance had increased to $15,903.57 Applicant acknowledged the 
account became delinquent when she had to pay for her son’s college expenses rather 
than paying this individual account.58 She acknowledged that she had not made any 
payments, but contended that in March 2011, she sought a loan modification with the 
original lender.59

approved, or that timely payments have been made continuously since March 2011. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1. i.): Applicant financed the purchase of an automobile in November 
2007.60 By January 2010, the account had become 180 days past due, in the amount of 
$7,664, with a balance of $7,668.61 The balance was charged off and the account was 
closed in January 2010.62 The account was apparently transferred or sold to a debt 
purchaser. Applicant acknowledged the account became delinquent when she had to 
pay for her son’s college expenses rather than paying this individual account.63 In 
February 2010, Applicant stated she was “currently working out a consolidation loan 
with [another bank] and planned (sic) on having it paid off in full in [March] 2010.”64 In 
March 2011, Applicant contended she had made her first payment of $100 to the new 
holder of the debt.65 She submitted a money order, in the amount of $100, dated March 
9, 2011, made to the order of the debt collector, to demonstrate her initial payment.66 In 
May 2011, Applicant claimed to be making continuing monthly payments, of an 
unspecified amount, on unspecified dates, but she has offered no documentary 
evidence, such as receipts or cancelled checks, to support her contention that timely 
payments have been made continuously since March 2011.67
 
 
(SOR ¶ 1. j.): In February 2006, Applicant and her boyfriend financed the 
purchase of a residence with a mortgage loan in the amount of $92,800.68 In December 
2009, Applicant fell behind in her monthly mortgage payment, and by February 2010, 
the account was 30 days past due on a balance of $88,249.69 Applicant’s boyfriend had 
lost his job and moved to another state, leaving Applicant unable to make the monthly 
payment.70 The bank notified Applicant that the foreclosure process had started, and in 
November 2010, Applicant’s check in the amount of $1,987.52 was returned because it 
did “not represent the total amount due” on the account.71

she was “going to do a loan modification,” but had to wait until she had completed her 
taxes in May 2011.72 She denied the loan had gone to foreclosure.73
 
 Applicant has 
offered no documentary evidence, such as a loan modification application or loan 
modification agreement, to support her contentions. 
(SOR ¶ 1.k.): Applicant obtained a student loan for an unspecified amount for her 
son during an unspecified period. The SOR alleged a loan with the U.S. Department of 
Education was placed for collection, in the approximate amount of $7,262, on an 
unspecified date. Applicant admitted those facts, but stated she believed the loan was 
to be deferred and that the lender had already furnished her with the forms to complete 
in order to apply for a deferment.74 The 2010 credit report refers to only one student 
loan with the identified creditor, and as of December 2009, that loan, with a balance of 
$4,860, was reported as deferred with $713 past due 180 days.75 The 2011 credit report 
also refers to the same creditor, and as of December 2010, that student loan, with a 
balance of $5,776, was reported as in collection with a past due balance of $5,776.76 By 
March 2011, the account balance had increased to $7,262, with a principal balance of 
$4,933, interest of $907.60, and fees and costs of $1,421.60.77 Applicant and the 
creditor entered into a repayment agreement on her “defaulted” account, and her initial 
$83 payment was due by March 8, 2011, followed by regular monthly payments.78 
Applicant made that initial payment,79
 
 but has offered no documentary evidence, such 
as receipts or cancelled checks, to support her contention that timely payments have 
been made continuously since March 2011. 
On January 20, 2010, when Applicant completed and submitted her SF 86, she 
responded to questions in Section 26 thereof, inquiring about her financial record.80 
Among the questions were inquiries regarding accounts in collection, defaults on loans, 
delinquencies on any Federal debts, and 90-or 180-day delinquencies on any debts. 
Applicant responded “no” to each question, despite her knowledge that the debts 
identified in the SOR fell within the categories inquired about.81 The investigator from 
the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) attributed Applicant’s failure to 
properly answer the questions to “oversight.”82

In March 2011, Applicant completed a personal financial statement reflecting net 
monthly income of $4,215.11; total monthly expenses of $1,500; and monthly debt 
payments of $1,157.26.83 A monthly net remainder of $1,557.85 was available for 
discretionary spending.84
 
 
 There is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling covering 
such topics as debt consolidation, money management, repayment plans, or budgeting.  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”85 As Commander in Chief, 
the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national 
security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access 
to such information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his 
designee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a 
finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”86
 
   
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines 
are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of 
variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”87

a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, 
extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s 
case. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.88
 
  
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as 
well. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to 
repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants 
access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
Furthermore, “security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”89
 
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no 
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”90
 
 Thus, nothing 
in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, 
or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are 
reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise

questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under 
AG ¶ 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  
Similarly, under AG ¶ 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise 
security concerns. Also, “consistent spending beyond one’s means, which may be 
indicated by excessiveness indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-
income ratio, and/or other financial analysis,” may be potentially disqualifying under AG 
¶ 19(e). 
 
As noted above, Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties in 1997. 
She lost her residence to foreclosure in February 1997. On several occasions in 1998 
and 1999, she uttered bad or non-sufficient checks to obtain goods or services. In 2008 
and 2009 she again experienced substantial financial difficulties when she found herself 
unable to continue making monthly payments on her various accounts, and they 
became delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection, some fell into default, 
and some were charged off. One residence was foreclosed and sold at auction in 2010, 
and the foreclosure process was commenced on another residence in 2010.  Applicant 
purchased Christmas gifts, household items, and tires for her automobile, as well as 
obtained student loans for her son, but chose to pay her son’s college expenses rather 
than remaining current with her accounts. Her accounts remained unaddressed by her 
during the entire period, despite maintaining her regular employment and her second 
part-time job. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(e) apply.    
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG ¶ 20(a), the disqualifying condition 
may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG 
¶ 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted 
in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of 
employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce 
or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence 
that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are 
clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially 
mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG ¶ 20(d) applies where the evidence shows 
Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise 
resolve debts.@91
                                                          
91 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith 
action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ 
However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person 
 
12 
                                      
 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. Applicant was living beyond her means 
while continuing to purchase items, finance residences and an automobile, and obtain 
student loans for her son when her accounts became delinquent. Despite maintaining 
her permanent employment, and obtaining a part-time job, the financial situation is 
continuing in nature, and the specific causation is not adequately described. Applicant 
made a decision to continue her lifestyle while choosing to support her son’s college 
expenses in lieu of her own financial obligations. She simply stopped paying various 
accounts and they became delinquent. She denied having any financial delinquencies in 
January 2010.  
 
Although Applicant discussed her delinquent accounts with the OPM investigator 
in February 2010, and indicated her intention of paying off several accounts by April 
2010, she failed to do so. She also contended she had paid off one account in February 
2010, and that it had a zero balance, but that statement was subsequently proven 
inaccurate. It was not until March 2011, one year after her OPM interview, and several 
days following her receipt of the DOHA interrogatories that she contacted some of her 
creditors and made some payments. Applicant made her first payments on any of the 
SOR accounts in March 2011. She has produced little evidence to indicate that she has 
contacted all of her creditors, attempted to negotiate settlements, established 
repayment plans, or commenced making routine monthly payments. With a monthly net 
remainder available for discretionary spending, it was possible that Applicant could have 
commenced the payment of her delinquent accounts. While she provided some 
evidence of an initial payment for some of the accounts, she has submitted no 
documentary evidence to support her contentions that she has repayment agreements 
for all of the accounts or that she has made more than the initial payments. The majority 
of the accounts remain unpaid or unresolved.92
 
 In addition, there is no evidence 
establishing that Applicant ever received financial counseling. Applicant’s handling of 
her finances, under the circumstances, casts doubt on her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies because of Applicant’s loss of employment and 
separation from her husband in 1997. That might explain why no efforts were made 
during that brief period, but the events commencing ten years later, and continuing until 
at least 2011, are largely unexplained. Her boyfriend’s job loss and relocation may offer 
                                                                                                                                                                                           
acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally 
available option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the 
“good-faith” mitigating condition].

92 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when 
dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case 
No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-
13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and 
attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

some explanation as to why she has been struggling with their jointly-owned residence, 
but there is no other explanation for Applicant’s continuing financial problems. Applicant 
failed to describe which specific factors were beyond her control, other than her general 
lifestyle, and decision to place her son’s college expenses before her other financial 
obligations. She failed to state what caused her inability to continue making her monthly 
payments. Moreover, sufficient time has passed since Applicant generated her bills and 
she still has not fully addressed her delinquent accounts. The reasons stated do not 
establish she acted “responsibly under the circumstances.”  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) only minimally applies because Applicant has failed to show that, 
aside from some last-minute payments in March 2011, she had made continuing good-
faith efforts to repay, or even address, her overdue creditors or otherwise resolve her 
debts. She has offered very little documentation to support her contention that such 
efforts have been made. To the extent that she made some efforts, the inconsistencies 
in her explanations, and her omissions regarding delinquent accounts in her SF 86, do 
not generate substantial confidence in her claims that she is making monthly payments 
or seeking modifications, especially in the absence of documentation to support her 
contentions. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have evaluated the various 
aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely 
performed a piecemeal analysis.93
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant 
spoke with some of her creditors in 2010 or 2011, but it is unclear what she told them or 
what offers she made to resolve the delinquencies.  
       
                                                          
93 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. 
Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
14 
                                      
 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. 
Applicant has a history of spending beyond her means, leading to financial 
delinquencies. She simply stopped making her monthly payments and chose to pay her 
son’s college expenses in lieu of her own accounts. She used credit cards, charge 
cards, and loans for a variety of purposes, and while she has finally started to focus on 
her delinquent debts, she has not really resolved any of those delinquent accounts. 
Applicant has offered no explanation as to why she was unable to continue making her 
monthly payments or why she could not seek reduced payments under repayment plans 
during the period 2007 to 2011. Even though she apparently has sufficient funds each 
month to make some small payments in an effort to resolve her accounts, until March 
2011, she apparently chose not to do so. Applicant’s relative inaction reflects traits 
which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. See AG ¶ 2(a)(1) 
through AG ¶ 2(a)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.f:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.g:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.h:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.i:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.j:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.k:    Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
