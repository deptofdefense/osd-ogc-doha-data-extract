Duffy, James F., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing 
(e-QIP) on May 13, 2010. On March 11, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F (financial considerations). The action was taken under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 
1960, as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of 
Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.

The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative 
finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
or continue Applicant’s security clearance. On March 29, 2011, Applicant answered the 
SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 3, 2011. DOHA 
issued the Notice of Hearing on August 10, 2011. The hearing was held as scheduled 
on August 30, 2011. Department Counsel offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 that were 
admitted into evidence without objection. Department Counsel’s list of exhibits was 
marked as hearing exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant testified, called no witnesses, and offered 
no exhibits. The record was left open until September 6, 2011, for the Applicant to 
submit additional matters. On September 6, 2011, Applicant requested a seven-day 
extension of the deadline, which was granted. On September 15, 2011, Applicant 
submitted post-hearing matters that were marked as AE A through F and admitted into 
evidence without objection. Department Counsel’s memorandum forwarding Applicant’s 
post-hearing submission was marked as HE 2. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the 
hearing on September 8, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
that contractor since September 2008. He earned an associate’s degree in 1997. He is 
separated from his second wife and has a child, age 18, and two step-children, ages 18 
and 23. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 1990 to September 1995 
and was honorably discharged. He enlisted in the Navy Reserve in February 2010 and 
is participating in monthly drills. He held a security clearance in the Navy.1 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had nine delinquent debts totaling $15,618. In 
his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted two allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.h) and 
denied the remaining allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. Credit reports dated May 20, 2010; December 21, 2010; and August 22, 2011 
established prima facie evidence of the delinquent debts.2 
 
From at least 2000 to 2007, Applicant was living and working in State A. In 
September 2007, he was laid off from his job with a telecommunications company as it 
downsized. His annual salary was $57,000 before he was laid off. He was unemployed 
for about one month and received unemployment compensation. From October 2007 to 
April 2008, he worked as a car salesman. His salaries at the car dealerships were 
based on sales commissions. Next, he worked at a transmission company for two 
months and then had a part-time job with a temporary employment agency for three 
months. His salaries from his jobs after he was laid off were much less than his salary at 
the telecommunications company. In September 2008, he moved to State B to obtain

his current job. His wife remained in State A. His new employer paid him $1,000 for 
relocation expenses. His current annual salary is about $44,000.3 
 
Each of the alleged debts is addressed below. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a – collection account in the amount of $870. This debt was for a cell 
phone account. In 2008, Applicant was halfway through his cell phone contract when his 
cell phone stopped receiving calls. He mailed the cell phone back to the company for a 
new one. When the company received the cell phone, it had water damage. He claimed 
that the cell phone had no water damage when he mailed it and that he had insurance 
for it. He decided to return the new phone. The company received the new phone 
beyond the deadline for returning it and charged him for the new phone. It returned the 
new phone back to him. In 2008, he tried to negotiate a settlement of this debt, but was 
unsuccessful in doing so. He provided no documents substantiating that he has a 
legitimate basis for disputing this debt.4 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b – credit card account 120-days past-due in the amount of $567 with a 
balance of $2,281; SOR ¶ 1.c – credit card account 90-days past-due in the amount of 
$383 with a balance of $3,422; and SOR ¶ 1.g – home mortgage in foreclosure that was 
past due in the amount of $12,264 with a balance of $126,000. These three accounts 
are related. In 2005, Applicant purchased a home for $85,000. He had a 30-year fixed 
mortgage with monthly payments of $631. In early 2007, he refinanced the home to 
make home improvements. After the refinancing, his mortgage was about $100,000, 
with monthly payments of $900. As part of the refinancing, he received $3,000 in cash 
and obtained two credit cards that were to be used for home improvements. One credit 
card had a limit of $1,000 and the other $2,000. He indicated that he may have used 
those credit cards once or twice for things other than home improvements.5 
 
After he was laid off in September 2007, Applicant lived with his wife in another 
residence and rented this home under the Housing and Urban Development (HUD) 
Section 8 program. Under that program, the maximum rent he could charge was $750. 
At that time, he was able to pay the difference between the rental income and mortgage 
payments from either his 401k account or income obtained in subsequent jobs. 
Because he moved to State B in September 2008, he was managing the property as a 
long-distance landlord. In about December 2008, the tenant moved out the property and 
left it damaged. He spent about $1,500 to make repairs. He attempted to rent the home 
again but was unable to do so. He became delinquent on his mortgage in about 
September 2009 and, sometime thereafter, the bank initiated foreclosure proceedings.6

In December 2009, Applicant hired a realtor to arrange a short sale of the home. 
He stated that the home was sold at a short sale for about $35,000 in February 2011, 
and all three accounts were resolved. At the hearing, he indicated that he would provide 
documents pertaining to the short sale of the home. In his post-hearing submission, 
however, he failed to provide those documents. His latest credit report reflects that the 
two credit card accounts were charged off and remain delinquent. As for the mortgage, 
his latest credit report reflects “contact mbr for status.” Insufficient evidence has been 
presented to establish that these debts have been resolved.7 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d – credit card account 120-days past-due in the amount of $254 with a 
balance of $825. This was a credit card with a $500 limit that Applicant maintained as 
an emergency fund. Before this account became delinquent, it had a balance of about 
$300, and he was making monthly payments of $35. In about May 2010, he made 
charges to the credit card beyond its credit limit that resulted in a $60 over-the-limit fee. 
At that point, he was unable to make the payments needed to avoid further late fees 
and penalties. This resulted in him falling further behind on this account as late fees and 
over-the-limit fees accumulated each month. At the hearing, Applicant stated he entered 
into a settlement agreement with this creditor, began making payments in April 2011, 
and the remaining balance was about $300. On August 25, 2011, he made a payment 
of $165 on this debt. He indicated that he would submit a document in his post-hearing 
submission that reflected the remaining balance was $300, but failed to do so. This debt 
is unresolved.8 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e – credit card account 90 days past-due in the amount of $166 with a 
balance of $825. Applicant used this credit card, which had a $500 credit limit, for 
personal purposes. He indicated that he planned to pay off SOR ¶¶ 1.d. and 1.h before 
addressing this debt. This debt is unresolved.9 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f – collection account in the amount of $855. This debt arose from an 
apartment that Applicant rented in State A immediately before moving to State B. Before 
breaking the lease, he spoke to the landlord’s agent. He thought he gave adequate 
notice and paid the amount required to terminate the lease. However, the landlord 
apparently disagreed. Months later, the landlord notified him that he owed another 
month’s rent and some fees. He attempted to negotiate a settlement, but was 
unsuccessful in doing so. He is disputing this debt, but provided no documents 
concerning the dispute.10

8 Tr. 25-29, 31-35; AE A. In his post-hearing submission, Applicant indicated that he provided a 
bank statement reflecting a payment of $165 to this creditor. Although he did not provide that bank 
statement, he did provide sufficient information for me to find that he made that payment as stated.

SOR ¶ 1.h – charged-off account in the amount of $255. This debt was for a 
vehicle that Applicant purchased in 2007. His wife used this vehicle and made the 
monthly payments of $200. She received a large sum of money and made a lump-sum 
payment to pay off the loan. However, she miscalculated the final payment and the loan 
was not paid. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that the creditor claimed he owed 
about $615 on this debt. He disputes that amount. He also stated that he made two 
payments totaling about $400 since May 2010 and the balance was $200. He claimed 
his last payment on this debt was in May 2011. He also indicated that changes in the 
collection agency handling this debt have delayed his payments. He provided no proof 
of any payments. This debt is unresolved.11 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i – collection account in the amount of $54. This debt was for a gas bill 
in State A. It became delinquent in June 2007. Applicant paid this bill on March 11, 
2011. This debt is resolved.12 
 
In 2003, Applicant accrued about $30,000 in child support arrearages. He stated 
that he was paying $200 per month in child support after his son was born and, over 
time, actually had paid more than was required. In 2003, his son’s mother moved to 
another county, and a court action was initiated to increase the amount of the child 
support. Applicant failed to attend the court proceeding. The court increased his child 
support payments to $635 per month. The court also ruled that Applicant owed three 
years of child support arrearages, resulting in the $30,000 deficiency. He stated that, 
when he decided not to attend the court proceeding, he did not know that the court was 
going to examine potential arrearages. At that time, he thought the court was only 
addressing the amount of the monthly payment. He was not aware of the court’s ruling 
on the arrearages until his next tax refund was withheld. He claimed he went to court 
several times to dispute the arrearages, but was told that the time limit for challenging 
that ruling had expired. Beginning in February 2010, his pay was garnished for the child 
support payments. He believes that arrearages have been reduced to about $6,000. He 
did not provide documentation to show the amount of the current arrearage balance.13 
 
Applicant received financial counseling before he bought his house in 2007. This 
counseling addressed budgeting and credit repair. On November 30, 2010, he 
submitted a Personal Financial Statement (PFS) that reflected his net monthly income 
was $2,100, that his total monthly expenses were $1,020, and that his total monthly 
debt payments were $770, leaving a net monthly remainder of $210. At the hearing, he 
testified that he withdrew money from his 401k to make mortgage payments in 2007.

12 Tr. 70-71; AE A, D, E; GE 2, 3, 4. 
13 Tr. 85-95; GE 2, 3. Applicant’s child support arrearages are not listed as a delinquent debt in 
the SOR. The arrearages will not be considered in applying the disqualifying conditions, but may be 
considered in assessing Applicant’s overall financial situation and applying the whole-person concept.

Due to those withdrawals, he owed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) about $5,000. 
For that deficiency, he is now paying $135 per month to the IRS that was not listed on 
his PFS. The IRS also has withheld his tax refunds for the past two years.14 
 
While on active duty in the Navy, Applicant was awarded the Good Conduct 
Medal. In this proceeding, he submitted no character reference letters or performance 
appraisals.15 
 
Policies 
 
The President of the United States has the authority to control access to 
information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is 
sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of 
Defense to grant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in 
regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that “no 
one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of 
law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and 
present, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, a 
clearance decision is merely an indication that the Applicant has or has not met the 
                                                          
14 Tr. 95-103, 117; GE 3. The IRS deficiency is not listed as a delinquent debt in the SOR. As 
noted in the previous footnote, this deficiency will not be considered in applying the disqualifying 
conditions, but may be considered for the other noted purposes.  
15 Tr. 110. 
 
7 
 
 
strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing 
a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).   
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18 as 
follows: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 
8 
 
 
 Applicant accumulated nine delinquent debts totaling over $15,000 that he has 
been unable or unwilling to satisfy for a number of years. This evidence is sufficient to 
raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s has multiple delinquent debts that are ongoing and significant. He 
was laid off from his job in September 2007 and was unemployed for about one month. 
Thereafter, he has had lower-paying jobs, including his current job at which he earns 
about $13,000 less per year than before he was laid off. His unemployment and 
underemployment were conditions beyond his control that contributed to his financial 
problems. To obtain full credit under AG ¶ 20(b), both prongs of that mitigating 
condition, i.e., conditions beyond the individual’s control and responsible conduct, must 
be established. Here, however, Applicant failed to establish that he acted responsibly 
since obtaining his current job in September 2008. He paid one delinquent debt of $54 
and also made a payment of $165 towards another debt. He provided no proof of other 
payments or of settlement agreements. He claimed his delinquent mortgage was 
resolved during a short sale of his home. However, he provided no proof substantiating 
that claim. Under these circumstances, I cannot find that he acted responsibly in 
resolving his delinquent debts since obtaining his current job in September 2008. 
Moreover, I cannot find that his financial problems arose under circumstances that are 
unlikely to recur or that they do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, 
or good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply. AG ¶ 20(b) and 20(d) partially apply. 
 
9 
 
 
 
AG ¶ 20(c) marginally applies because Applicant obtained financial counseling 
before purchasing his home in 2007. He disputes, in whole or in part, the debts in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, and 1.h but failed to provide documentation to substantiate that he has a 
legitimate basis for disputing those debts. In the absence of such documentation, AG ¶ 
20(e) does not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
I have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of 
all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
Applicant served on active duty in the Navy for five years and is currently serving in the 
Navy Reserve. He claims that he resolved some debts and has made payment on 
others, but he failed to produce documents supporting most of those claims. In essence, 
he has not established that he has taken meaningful steps to address his financial 
problems. Overall, the record leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial 
considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section 
E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
10 
 
 
 
Subparagraphs 1a – 1h:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph   1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Decision 
 
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security 
clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.
