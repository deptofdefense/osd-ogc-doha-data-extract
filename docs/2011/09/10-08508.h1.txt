Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke her
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
Applicant has a history of recurring financial problems or difficulties consisting of: (1) a
1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case resulting in discharge; (2) a 2005 Chapter 7
bankruptcy case resulting in discharge; and (3) 12 delinquent debts for about $18,000 in
total, which are currently unresolved. Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to
overcome the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided
against Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply here. The AG  were
published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace the
guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on April 13, 2011,1
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar
to a complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
Applicant timely answered the SOR. Neither Applicant nor Department Counsel
requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the written record.2
On or about June 7, 2011, the Agency submitted its written case consisting of all
relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-called file3
of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and received by her on or about
June 21, 2011. She then had a 30-day period to submit a response setting forth
objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation. Applicant timely replied, and
her reply consisted of a one-page memorandum and a one-page certificate of financial
counseling, which are marked and admitted as Exhibits A and B. The case was
assigned to me August 15, 2011.  
Findings of Fact
The SOR alleged a 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, a 2005 Chapter 7
bankruptcy case, and 12 collection or charged-off accounts, ranging in amounts from
$493 to $4,562 for a total of about $18,208. In Applicant’s six-page reply to the SOR,
she admitted the two bankruptcy cases and the 12 debts, although she could not
confirm the amounts owed as she thought they were for lesser amounts. She also
detailed circumstances surrounding her history of financial problems. Her admissions
are accepted as findings of fact. In addition, the following findings of fact are supported
by substantial evidence.
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has never
married and has one child, a daughter, born in 1981, who is now an adult and living on
her own. Applicant’s employment history is summarized as follows: (1) she worked as a

supply/procurement technician from October 1984 to January 2008 as a federal
employee of a military department; (2) she was unemployed from January 2008 to
August 2008; (3) she worked as a logistics specialist for a federal contractor from
August 2008 to December 2008; (4) she was unemployed from January 2009 to
October 2009; (5) she worked as a marking technician from October 2009 to February
2010; and (6) she began her current employment as an administrative specialist for a
federal contractor in March 2010. 
Applicant attributed the 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy to a combination of the loss
of financial support from her father after his death, assuming her father’s credit card
debt to help her mother, and her own illness.  She attributed the 2005 Chapter 74
bankruptcy to an increase in household living expenses when her daughter moved out
and illness.  She attributes her current situation to unemployment in 2008 and 2009; in5
addition, her boyfriend lost a job in 2009, although he found another the same year, but
it became a part-time job in January 2011.  6
The 12 delinquent debts in the SOR stem from collection or charged-off
accounts. Applicant did not present any documentary evidence showing she has paid,
settled, reduced the balance owed, or otherwise resolved these 12 debts. She
explained that she is involved with financial counseling on an ongoing basis.  She is7
endeavoring to create a financial stronghold before engaging in settlement or
repayment discussions with her creditors. She also noted that she has received a merit
increase of her salary along with two promotions with pay increases. 
Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As8
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent

 Directive, ¶ 3.2. 10

standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt9
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An10
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  11
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting12
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An13
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate14
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme15
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.16
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.17
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a

financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted); and see ISCR Case No. 07-09966 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2008) (In

person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it18
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant19
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline20
F is: 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  21
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information within the
defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of recurring
financial problems or difficulties. Two Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases within the last 15
years and the 12 delinquent debts raise security concerns because they indicate
inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial22
obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish23
these two disqualifying conditions.

person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.
Such standards are consistent with the level of conduct that must be expected of persons granted a security
clearance.”) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 02-30304 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (relying on a legally
available option, such as Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is not a good-faith effort) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No.
99-9020 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001) (relying on the running of a statute of limitations to avoid paying a debt is not
a good-faith effort).

There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F.  Any of the24
following may mitigate security concerns:
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;25
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
I have considered all the mitigating conditions, and none, individually or in
combination, are sufficient to overcome and mitigate the security concerns. It is
probable that Applicant’s financial problems are due, in part, to the various
circumstances she has explained and that these circumstances were largely beyond her
control. She is also making some effort, via financial counseling, to put her financial
house in good order. Nevertheless, the evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant’s
financial house has been in disrepair for a lengthy period, since at least the 1996
bankruptcy. It is also noteworthy that she went through both the 1996 and 2005 Chapter
7 bankruptcy cases while holding a full-time job as a federal employee. Moreover, what
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).26
7
is missing here is a realistic plan to resolve the 12 collection and charged-off accounts.
Other than financial counseling, which is a prudent step, Applicant has taken no action
in this regard. Given the lack of a realistic plan or a serious effort to resolve the 12
collection and charged-off accounts, it is difficult to predict if or when Applicant will
resolve her indebtedness. Time will tell if Applicant has both the ability and willingness
to resolve her financial problems. 
To conclude, the evidence of Applicant’s financial problems, past and present,
justifies current doubts about her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Following
Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in favor of protecting
national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-
person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence. Nevertheless, Applicant did not26
meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.n: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
