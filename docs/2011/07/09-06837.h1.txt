Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
he has a history of alcohol-related incidents; a history of criminal conduct largely but not
entirely related to alcohol; and a history of financial problems or difficulties (about
$50,000 in delinquent debts). He has abstained from alcohol since late November 2010,
attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and has a favorable prognosis from his therapist;
he is currently serving two years of supervised probation due to a November 2009
conviction for driving while intoxicated (DWI); and his efforts to resolve his financial
problems are at the initial stages. The current short-term trend is favorable, but given
the recency, nature, extent, and seriousness of these matters, it is too soon to tell if
these matters are safely in the past or a harbinger of things to come. He did not present
sufficient evidence of a long-term record of reform and rehabilitation to mitigate the
security concerns. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against
Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on August 3,1
2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the
national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar
to a complaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security
guidelines known as Guideline G for alcohol consumption, Guideline J for criminal
conduct, and Guideline F for financial considerations.   
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to another administrative judge on October 22, 2010. The hearing scheduled for
December 9, 2010, was continued at the request of Applicant’s recently retained
counsel. The case was then reassigned to me February 9, 2011. The hearing took place
March 31, 2011. The transcript (Tr.) was received April 8, 2011.
The record was kept open for two weeks, until April 15, 2011, to allow additional
documentary evidence in support of Applicant’s case. It was extended two more weeks,
until April 29, 2011. Applicant, through counsel, timely submitted several documents,
which are marked and admitted, without objections, as Exhibits N–S. 
 
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has not married
and has no children. His educational background includes a bachelor’s degree in
information technology (IT). He has worked in the IT field since at least 2000. He has
been employed as a quality assurance technician from April 2009 to present. He has a
good employment record in his current job and in the past.   2
Applicant’s employment history during the last decade includes two periods of
unemployment. He worked as a member of the technical staff for a large, publicly traded
telecommunications company from April 2000 to February 2008, when he was laid off
due to a reduction in force. He was earning between $73,000 and $80,000 annually
when laid off. He was then unemployed until about August 2008, when he accepted a
short-term position as a telecommunications technician. That job lasted 30 to 60 days
until about September 2008, when he resumed unemployment until April 2009. He
received about $1,700 monthly as unemployment compensation during these two
 Tr. 115. 3
 Exhibits 2, 4, 8–13. 4
3
periods. He relocated to his state of current residence in late 2008, and he began his
current job in April 2009. His starting salary was less than he previously earned, about
$55,000 annually, and he is now earning about $65,000 annually.3
Applicant has a lengthy history of alcohol-related incidents away from work.  This4
history also includes criminal conduct that was largely but not entirely related to his use
of alcohol. The various events are noted below: 
1. Arrested and charged with domestic-violence offenses in February 2001; charges
dismissed in 2003 upon completing domestic-violence classes. Alcohol was not
involved. 
2. Arrested and charged with driving while ability impaired by alcohol in May 2001;
pleaded guilty and sentenced to probation.
3. Arrested and charged with obstructing or interfering with police in April 2004;
pleaded guilty and sentenced to one day of jail, a fine, and costs. Alcohol was
involved. 
4. Arrested and charged with speeding and driving under the influence (DUI) in
October 2005. Convicted in June 2006 and sentenced to five days of jail, 24
months of probation, 48 hours of community service, and ordered to attend an
alcohol education and assessment program. Subsequently, he was discharged
from the program for noncompliance with attendance requirements. 
5. Arrested and charged with fugitive other jurisdiction–failure to appear on July 3,
2006, fugitive other jurisdiction–failure to appear on August 21, 2006, and a
traffic offense. The first two charges related to the June 2006 DUI conviction and
sentence.
6. Arrested and charged with DWI in August 2007. Convicted in November 2009
and sentenced to 180 days in jail (suspended), a fine, and court costs, and two
years of probation. He remains on supervised probation through November 2011.
7. Charged with probation violation in January 2009, when he appeared in court in
an attempt to transfer probation from the June 2006 DUI conviction to his state of
current residence. Then unemployed and living in another jurisdiction, the case
was resolved with a sentence of 30 days in jail, of which he served about 21. 
Applicant’s addiction therapist (a licensed clinical social worker with a Ph.D.) and
probation officer both testified on his behalf and they vouched for his current good
behavior. The therapist assessed Applicant’s current status as stable (“he’s doing

fine”),  and that Applicant needs to continue or persist on the same path, which includes5
regular attendance at AA.  The diagnosis was a “toss-up” between alcohol dependence6
and alcohol abuse, and the therapist assessed Applicant’s prognosis as “excellent.”7
The therapist is of the opinion that Applicant is now sufficiently motivated to abstain
from alcohol.  This is consistent with Applicant’s testimony, as he now recognizes his8
problematic history of alcohol use, he intends to continue seeing the therapist, he
intends to continue attending AA and working the 12-step program, and he intends to
continue abstaining from all alcohol use, as he is seeing positive benefits in his life.  9
Likewise, Applicant’s probation officer explained that Applicant has complied with
all terms and conditions of probation, to include successfully completing a state DWI
education program, attending a MADD victim-impact panel, completing 42 hours of
community service.  The probation officer described Applicant’s attitude as “responsive10
and responsible” and characterized him as an “excellent probationer.”  Based on his11
contact with Applicant, the probation officer does not foresee any problems with the
balance of Applicant’s term of probation. 
Concerning the financial matters, the SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts (collection
accounts and charged-off accounts) ranging in amounts from $202 to $17,353 for a total
of about $53,269. Department Counsel conceded that two debts are duplicates, and so
favorable findings will be made on SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, which duplicate the debts at
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.h, respectively. In his Answer, Applicant admitted responsibility for all
the debts alleged. Based on his testimony and the documentary exhibits, 3 of the 15
debts are paid or settled for a total of about $981; 2 debts are duplicates; 4 debts are in
the initial stages of a repayment agreement; and 6 debts are unresolved. The current
status of each debt is described in the following table.

Applicant attributed his indebtedness to unemployment as well as the
consequences of his past decisions. For example, his November 2009 DWI conviction
resulted in about $13,000 in associated expenses, and he is currently paying  about
$2,000 yearly as a special fee or surcharge for his driver’s license, which is scheduled
to end with his probation in November 2011. He believes he has sufficient income to
pay his regular monthly expenses and repay his delinquent debts, and he described his
efforts to do so as a “work in progress.”12

Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As13
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt14
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An15
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  16
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting17
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An18
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate19
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme20
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21

The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it23
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
1. Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct 
The security concerns under these two guidelines are discussed together
because, based on the record, they are largely factually interrelated, and both
guidelines focus on an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness as core concerns.
Under Guideline G for alcohol consumption,  the suitability of an applicant may be24
questioned or put into doubt due to a history of excessive alcohol consumption. Under
Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be questioned or25
put into doubt due to a history of criminal activity.
Here, the evidence is more than sufficient to establish security concerns based
on Applicant’s well-established and lengthy history of alcohol-related incidents away
from work and criminal activity that was largely related to his alcohol use. The several
incidents noted in the findings of fact that took place during 2001–2009 establish a
pattern of behavior. He compounded problems for himself when he failed to attend the
court-ordered alcohol education and assessment program based on the June 2006 DUI
conviction. As a result, he served jail time in January 2009. He is currently under a
suspended sentence of 180 days in jail and on supervised probation for his November
2009 DWI conviction. His probation is scheduled to terminate later this year. 
Based on the evidence as a whole, the following disqualifying conditions under
Guideline G are raised:
8
AG ¶ 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while
under the influence of alcohol . . . ;
AG ¶ 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of
impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as
an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;
AG ¶ 22(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a
licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized
alcohol treatment program; and
AG ¶ 22(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education,
evaluation, treatment, or abstinence. 
And under Guideline J, the following disqualifying conditions are raised:
AG ¶ 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;
AG ¶ 31(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of
whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or
convicted;
AG ¶ 31(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; and 
AG ¶ 31(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-
mandated rehabilitation program. 
There are several mitigating conditions to consider under each guideline. The
following mitigating condition under Guideline G is most pertinent:
AG ¶ 23(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of
alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this
problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol
dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).
And under Guideline J, the following mitigating condition is most pertinent:
AG ¶ 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not
limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,
remorse or restitution, job training of higher education, good employment
record, or constructive community involvement.
After considering the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions, the central
issue is whether Applicant presented sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation to
mitigate and overcome the obvious security concerns under both guidelines. I conclude
that he has not. His problematic use of alcohol and related criminal activity are of recent
 AG ¶¶ 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 26
 See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an27
applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness
or recurring financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted).

vintage. He is now doing the right things, such as abstaining from alcohol, attending
AA, and he has a favorable prognosis from his therapist. But these are all new
developments, as shown by his four to five months of abstinence at the time of hearing.
Likewise, his criminal activity is a current factor as shown by his suspended sentence of
180 days in jail with 24 months of supervised probation. Although not a per se bar to a
favorable decision, Applicant’s current probationary status is a significant fact that
cannot be disregarded in weighing his evidence of reform and rehabilitation. 
2. Financial Considerations
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant26
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline27
F is:
 Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  28
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. Indeed, he accumulated about $50,000 in delinquent debts over
a period of years. This raises security concerns because it indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within29 30
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions. 
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:  
10
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
AG ¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the
problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being
resolved or is under control;
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue
creditors or otherwise resolve debts;
AG ¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or
 
AG ¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
The most pertinent here are AG ¶ 20(b)—conditions beyond his control, and AG ¶
20(d)—making a good-faith effort, and both apply. 
Applicant’s problematic financial history appears to be due to unemployment,
general financial mismanagement or inattention, and expenses  incurred due to his legal
troubles. He is now facing a small mountain of delinquent debt along with normal
expenses. To his credit, he is trying to repay them as opposed to seeking relief in
bankruptcy court. So far, he has paid or settled less than $1,000 for three debts and just
recently entered into repayment agreements for four debts. Six debts remain
unresolved. It appears he is now on the right track, but what is missing here is a long-
term record of repayment of delinquent debts coupled with general financial stability and
responsibility. At this point, it is too soon to tell if will resolve his delinquent debts in the
foreseeable future. He has not made sufficient progress to fully mitigate the security
concerns stemming from his problematic financial history. 
3. Whole-Person Concept
Looking at the case as a whole, the evidence justifies current doubts about
Applicant’s  judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He engaged in drinking to excess
that resulted in multiple alcohol-related incidents. He has had multiple arrests, charges,
and convictions, and he is currently on probation. And his financial house is in disrepair.
The current short-term trend is favorable, but given the recency, nature, extent, and
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9).31
11
seriousness of these matters, it is too soon to tell if these matters are safely in the past
or a harbinger of things to come. He did not present sufficient evidence of a long-term
record of reform and rehabilitation to mitigate the security concerns. 
Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these doubts in
favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due
consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant’s favorable evidence.31
Nevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a
favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline G: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.e: Against Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline J: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 2.a–2.e: Against Applicant
Paragraph 3, Guideline F: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 3.a–3.b: Against Applicant
Subparagraphs 3.c–3.d: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 3.e–3.o: Against Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to
classified information is denied.
