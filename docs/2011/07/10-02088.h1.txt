O’BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: 
 
Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I 
conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline 
for Financial Considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is 
granted. 
  
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic 
Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86) on January 16, 2008. After 
reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary 
affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
 
1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. 
 
 
2
                                                
Applicant’s request. On November 22, 2010, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR), which specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed 
in the Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative 
Guidelines (AG).2 
 
In his Answer to the SOR, dated January 18, 2011, Applicant denied 14 
allegations of the 19 SOR allegations. He also requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 8, 
2011, and I received the case on February 24, 2011. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing 
on February 28, 2011. I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 15, 2011. 
 
During the hearing, the Government offered 14 exhibits, which I admitted as 
Government Exhibit (GE) 1 through 14. Applicant testified, and offered 28 exhibits, 
which I admitted as Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A through BB. I held the record open to 
allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. He timely submitted five 
documents, which I admitted as AE CC through GG. Applicant's comments on his post-
hearing submissions, and Department Counsel’s response, taken together, are marked 
as Hearing Exhibit I.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant’s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated as findings of 
fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant’s response to the SOR, and the 
record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. 
 
Applicant, 48 years old, is a high school graduate. He married in 1987, and 
divorced in 1996. He has two sons, 18 and 21 years old. Applicant completed a 
bachelor’s degree in computer science in 1985. He also earned credits toward a 
master’s degree, but did not complete it. In the early 1980s, Applicant worked on a 
federal program and held a secret security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 39-42)   
 
 From 1989 to 2003, Applicant was a firefighter, paramedic, and hazardous 
materials technician for a county fire department. Due to injuries sustained while 
working as a firefighter, he retired on a medical disability in 2003, and his pay was 
significantly reduced. For several years, he operated his own business, which focused 
on communications engineering. In 2008, he obtained salaried employment with a 
federal contractor for about one year as a senior program analyst. From December 
2009 to June 2010, Applicant was unemployed. He began his current employment with 
a defense contractor in June 2010. He was a program manager, but in approximately  
 
2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines, which supersede the guidelines 
listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in 
which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.

September 2010, as a result of the security clearance process, he was re-assigned to 
the position of subject matter expert. In 2010, Applicant accepted a second job involving 
“intermittent employment” as a telecommunications specialist. (GE 1, 2; AE BB, FF; Tr. 
42-46) 
 
Applicant and his wife were granted joint legal custody of their children following 
their divorce in 1996. Applicant was granted primary physical custody of the two 
children. His ex-wife was required to pay $500 per month child support. She paid 
inconsistently, two or three times per year. She paid no child support from 2006 to 2008. 
In 2008, at a hearing on the child support issue, his ex-wife was $30,000 in arrears. 
They negotiated the debt to the current balance of $25,000. Applicant's ex-wife was to 
pay $150 toward the arrearage, in addition to the $500 per month. After the hearing, 
Applicant received three payments, but he has received no further child support since 
2008. (GE 2, 5; AE R, S; 48-50) 
 
 In 2001, Applicant started his own business to provide extra income, in light of 
the lack of child support. However, he could not work at it consistently because of the 
time constraints of his job, and the demands of being a single parent. He decided to file 
a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in an effort to re-organize and resolve his debts 
(allegation 1.a). The bankruptcy included debts totaling approximately $63,000. After 
paying a total of $11,500, Applicant requested that the bankruptcy be dismissed in 
2004, because he had been promised a full-time job that would enable him to pay his 
debts. The bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2004. (GE 2, 3, 13; Tr. 60-62) 
 
While working as a firefighter, Applicant suffered burn injuries that required 
treatment at a shock-trauma unit. He was also exposed to substances that caused lung 
damage. In 2003, while performing a rescue, Applicant broke his knee in six places. He 
was not able to perform his duties as a firefighter, or his special operations duties as a 
hazardous materials technician. He was placed on reduced work status, and remained 
at home. He required four reconstructive surgeries. While on reduced work status, his 
salary was significantly reduced. He received a 55 percent disability benefit starting in 
2003. (GE 5; Tr. 46-48) 
 
Applicant bought his home in 2000 for $209,000. After retiring on his medical 
disability in 2003, he used the funds from his 401k account to meet daily living 
expenses and try to avoid foreclosure on his home. However, in 2005, the lender 
foreclosed and the home was subsequently sold. The sale garnered more than the loan 
balance, resulting in a surplus. In June 2006, Applicant received $109,520, which he 
divided equally with his then-fiancée. With approximately $54,000, he was able to pay 
several debts, fund his business, and pay rent. (GE 5; AE J – O; Tr. 56-59) 
 
Applicant has sought help in resolving his debts. In 2001, he filed the Chapter 13 
bankruptcy, in order to reorganize and resolve his debts. In July 2008, he retained a 
company that provided advice on repairing credit; it did not negotiate settlements or 
 
 
4
                                                
consolidate debts. He cancelled the contract the same day he signed it. He testified that 
he believed he could work with creditors and pay his debts without assistance. (GE 2, 5; 
Tr. 97-99) 
  
 Applicant’s March 2011 income and expense worksheet lists income from three 
sources: wages of $54.47 per hour as a subject matter expert; intermittent employment 
as a telecommunications specialist for a federal agency at $36 per hour; and a disability 
retirement payment of $2,464 net monthly. His income as a subject matter expert 
fluctuates, but in February 2011, he earned $5,434 net income. He estimated monthly 
income of $2,400 from the telecommunications position. The three sources yield roughly 
$10,300 per month.3  After expenses of $6,585, his current net remainder appears to be 
approximately $3,715, although the telecommunications specialist job is intermittent and 
might not provide income every month. He has a 2001 car that he bought for $4,000 
cash in 2009. His oldest son lives on his own and supports himself. Applicant supports 
his younger son, who started college in 2010. He pays $600 per month in tuition and 
approximately $200 per month for books and other costs. He also spent funds assisting 
in the care of his elderly parents, before his father passed away. (AE FF, GG; Tr. 53-56) 
 
The current status of Applicant's debts follows. Unless otherwise noted, the debts 
appear in Applicant's credit bureau reports of October 2008, April and October 2010 and 
March 2011. (GE 7, 8, 9) 
 
Allegations 1.b ($19,456); 1.c ($16,735)4 – tax lien. RELEASED; PAYMENT PLAN  
 
The IRS filed tax liens against Applicant because of problems with Applicant's 
returns in tax years 1994 through 1998. Applicant testified that the problems stemmed 
from two events: his ex-wife claimed their two children as her dependents on her return, 
even though Applicant was the custodial parent. In addition, Applicant’s private child-
care provider gave him false information, which he provided to the IRS; the IRS 
subsequently denied his child-care credit. Applicant later resolved the dependents’ 
issue by providing the IRS with receipts showing that he was his children’s physical 
custodian and paid for their support. At the hearing, Applicant provided IRS documents 
showing all tax liens have been released.5 AE A also shows that Applicant's tax returns 
for 1988 through 1996 and 1998 through 2009 have been filed and the taxes are paid in 
full. An outstanding balance remains for one tax year--1997. Applicant provided a letter 
from the IRS confirming that he has a payment plan in place, has been paying $500 per 
 
3 Applicant listed $6,700 in wages from his position as a subject matter expert. However, his earnings 
statement shows net income of $5,434 after taxes and deductions. (AE FF, GG) 
 
4 The IRS documents show an original outstanding balance of $19,456 for tax years 1994 through 1998, 
but do not show a lien for $16,735. Applicant's 2011 credit report shows a lien for $16,735, and lists it as 
paid. The IRS documentation shows that all years from 1988 through 2009 are paid in full, except for 
1997. The tax for that year was $8,752. I find that the debt alleged at ¶ 1.c is not a separate lien, but 
included in the amount alleged at ¶ 1.b. (AE A, C, CC, EE) 
 
5 As Applicant divorced in 1996, this situation would have affected tax years 1996 through 1998. (GE 1) 
 
 
5
month, and is in compliance with the tax law. As of the date of the hearing, he had 
reduced the remaining balance for 1997 to $3,895. (GE 2, 5, 11, 12; AE A, C, U, AA, 
CC; Tr. 62-68) 
 
Allegation 1.d ($576) - cable – PAID  
 At his security interview in 2008, Applicant stated he did not know this cable debt 
was delinquent. At the hearing, he provided a receipt showing he paid $588.99 on 
December 27, 2010. His March 2011 credit report shows the debt is paid. (GE 2, 4; AE 
F, EE; Tr. 68) 
 
Allegations 1.e ($50)- medical; 1.f ($108)  – UNRESOLVED  
 Applicant testified that he paid both debts on December 28, 2010 through a 
deduction from his checking account in the amount of $114. He did not provide 
supporting documentation. His March 2011 credit report shows both debts as delinquent 
and in collection. (GE 2; AE EE; Tr. 68-70) 
 
Allegations 1.g ($560); 1.h ($166) - Insufficient funds - UNRESOLVED 
 The same creditor holds both debts. Applicant testified he paid both using a 
check-by-phone in December 2010 in the amount of $750.86. He did not provide 
supporting documentation. The debts are listed in his October 2010 credit report, but 
not in his March 2011 credit report. (GE 2, 7; AE EE; Tr. 70-71, 106) 
 
Allegation 1.i ($917) – credit card – PAID 
 Applicant testified that he paid this credit card balance in December 2010 
through an electronic transfer from his checking account. His March 2011 credit report 
shows a current balance of $29. (AE EE; Tr. 71-74) 
 
Allegation 1.j – ($990) – credit card - PAYMENT PLAN  
  Applicant has been paying on this debt since December 2010 through automatic 
electronic debit, and the debt has been reduced to $697. He provided proof of payments 
of $167.83 in December 2010, and January and February 2011. His hand-written notes 
indicate a balance of $502.49 as of March 2011. (AE H, T, EE; Tr. 71-76) 
 
Allegation 1.k ($353) – Insufficient funds - UNRESOLVED  
  Applicant does not recognize this debt, and is researching it to determine if it is 
valid. His 2011 credit report shows it relates to a purchase at a used auto parts store, 
and is unpaid. (AE EE; Tr. 76-77) 
 
Allegation 1.l ($1,041) – telephone – UNRESOLVED  
 Applicant contacted the creditor in February 2010, and paid $1,022 on a total 
debt of $2,064, which left the remaining balance of $1,041. He contacted the creditor 
later in 2010, and explained that he could not make additional payments because he 
was unemployed and his son’s tuition was due at the time. He testified he paid the 
remainder on January 23, 2011 by electronic debit. He provided documentation showing 
 
 
6
his February 2010 payment of $1,022, but not the final payment in 2011. His credit 
report of March 2011 shows a balance due of $1,041. (AE I, EE; Tr. 77) 
 
Allegation 1.m ($612) – credit card - UNRESOLVED 
 Applicant testified he paid this debt in 2010, but he did not provide 
documentation to support his claim. His March 2011 credit report shows it as unpaid. 
(AE EE; GE 7, 8, 9; Tr. 79-81) 
 
Allegation 1.n – Insufficient funds - RESOLVED  
 The debt relates to a purchase of parts for Applicant’s truck. He testified that he 
paid the debt with cash in 2010. His March 2011 credit report shows that the balance is 
zero. (AE EE; Tr. 81-82)  
 
Allegation 1.o ($486) – credit card - PAID  
 Although Applicant does not recognize this debt, he testified that he sent a 
cashier’s check in the full amount on December 23, 2010. He did not receive 
correspondence from the creditor subsequent to the payment. His 2011 credit report 
shows the account is closed with a balance of zero. (AE EE; Tr. 82-83) 
 
Allegation 1.p – ($1,034) – payday loan - UNRESOLVED  
 Applicant needed funds to pay his utility bill in 2008 and procured a “payday 
loan.” He believes he paid this loan in 2009. He provided a hand-written note listing the 
creditor’s name and telephone number, but no proof of payment. His March 2011 credit 
report shows the debt as unpaid. (GE 2; AE DD, EE; Tr. 83-84) 
 
Allegation 1.q ($18,060) – auto repossession - UNRESOLVED 
 The SOR debt listed at ¶ 1.q is the original amount owed on a 1999 car loan. 
Applicant testified that during the child support hearing in 2008, he had a receipt 
showing the car was sold for $10,000 after it was repossessed. He could not provide the 
receipt. He believes the current balance is $8,000. He testified that when he recently 
contacted the creditor, the company could not provide information on the current status 
of the debt. His 2011 credit report lists a 2008 judgment for $13,600. (GE 5; AE P, W, X, 
Y, Z, BB, EE; Tr. 84-89, 94) 
 
Allegation 1.r ($13,840) – Judgment – DISMISSED 
 In 2005, Applicant paid a deposit equivalent to four months’ rent, or 
approximately $12,800, when he leased an apartment. In his security interview of March 
2008, he stated he had funds for the rent because he had recently won a large contract 
for his business. His company later lost the contract, and Applicant informed 
management he was unable to keep up with the rental payments. He was told he would 
not be penalized if he left the premises before the end of 2006, which he did. In 2007, 
he was sued for the unpaid rent. In landlord/tenant court, he showed evidence of his 
substantial deposit, his rental payments, and a letter stating that he would not be 
pursued if he vacated by December 2006, as requested. The judge dismissed the case 
in October 2007. The debt does not appear in his credit bureau reports of 2008 or 2010, 
 
 
7
                                                
but is listed in his 2011 credit report. He has not been contacted by the creditor since 
the dismissal. (GE 2, 3, 10; AE Q, EE; Tr. 88-94) 
 
Allegation 1.s – Insufficient funds – RESOLVED 
 In March 2005, Applicant performed work for one of his clients and deposited the 
client’s payment. He then purchased goods at a local store using his own check. It did 
not clear because the check that his client had written was drawn on an account with 
insufficient funds. On January 31, 2006, a felony arrest warrant was issued. Applicant 
testified that he was unaware of the warrant until after he paid the debt. Applicant 
provided documentation showing that he repaid the debt, plus fees, four years ago on 
June 15, 2006. The prosecution nol prossed the case on March 28, 2008. Applicant has 
retained an attorney to assist him in having his record expunged. His 2011 credit report 
lists the debt as paid. (GE 2, 5, 14; AE D, E, EE; Tr. 94-97) 
 
Policies 
 
 Each security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
determination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, 
and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.6 Decisions 
must also reflect consideration of the “whole-person” factors listed in ¶ 2(a) of the 
guidelines. 
 
 The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does not 
determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable 
guidelines are followed when a case can be measured against them as they represent 
policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this 
case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration 
of the adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).   
 
 A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest7 for an applicant to either receive or 
continue to have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial 
burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision 
to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government 
must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets 
its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government’s 
case. Because no one has a “right” to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy 
burden of persuasion.8 A person who has access to classified information enters into a 
fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the 
 
6 Directive. 6.3.

government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the 
requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national 
interests as his or her own. The “clearly consistent with the national interest” standard 
compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant’s suitability for access in 
favor of the government.9 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
AG ¶18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially over-
extended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. 
Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes 
including espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known 
sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds 
from financially profitable criminal acts. 
 
 Applicant has accrued significant debts over the past ten years. He filed a 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, had numerous debts in collection status, and some 
debts remain unpaid. The record supports application of the following disqualifying 
conditions under AG ¶19: 
 
(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  
 
 The Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate 
security concerns. I have considered the mitigating factors under AG ¶ 20, especially 
the following:  
 
 (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or 
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances; 
 
 
9 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, ¶ 2(b). 
 
 
9
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem 
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is 
under control; and, 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts.  
  
 Several factors affected Applicant’s finances. Except for sporadic payments, his 
ex-wife failed to pay child support since 1996, and as of 2008, she owed approximately 
$25,000 in arrears. In addition, Applicant’s job as a firefighter led to serious medical 
injuries, including burns, damage to his lungs, and four reconstructive surgeries on a 
broken knee sustained during a rescue. Following this accident, he lived on a 55 
percent disability benefit, and income from his own business. He could not predict or 
control his ex-wife’s failure to meet her financial obligations, or that he would be retired 
on a medical disability, all of which had a substantial negative impact on his ability to 
meet his debts. He started his own company in part to provide a source of income to 
support his family. AG ¶ 20(b) applies. 
 
 Applicant has been making efforts to resolve his financial situation. He is 
currently working two jobs. Although he ultimately decided to resolve his debts on his 
own, he initially sought assistance from a consumer credit agency. He has paid five 
debts in full. He has payment plans in place for two debts, including the largest debt in 
the SOR. He has been making payments on the tax debt, which occurred because of 
errors rather than a desire to avoid his tax obligations. Although the SOR alleged that 
he owed $36,191, the actual tax debt was $19,456. His payments have reduced that 
amount to $3,854. The IRS provided letters noting that he is in compliance and 
maintaining his payment plan. He also has been making payments on a payment plan 
for a credit card debt. After deducting the duplication at allegation 1.c, his reduction of 
the tax debt, and the debts Applicant has paid, he has reduced the alleged SOR debt 
by $53,318, or 71 percent. This figure does not include several debts that Applicant 
stated he paid, but could not find the supporting documentation. Applicant has made a 
good faith effort, resulting in substantial progress in resolving his financial situation. AG 
¶ 20 (c) and (d) apply.  
 
Whole-Person Analysis   
  
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the 
applicant’s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant’s conduct and all 
the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
 
 
10
                                                
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
AG ¶ 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited 
guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of 
all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  
 
 Applicant has supported himself and two children on reduced income, without 
assistance from his ex-wife, for the past 14 years. Nevertheless, the amount he 
currently owes is significantly less than the total alleged in the SOR. He has income 
from one full-time and one intermittent job, plus a disability payment, which leaves him 
with a solid monthly net remainder to continue his payment plans and resolve the 
remaining debts. Applicant had made a good-faith effort to reduce his debt, but he has 
not yet resolved every debt listed in the SOR. However, the Appeal Board has 
addressed this situation, stating: 
 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “’meaningful track record’ necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts.” However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrates that he has ‘…established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.’ The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation 
and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for 
the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (‘Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.’) There is no requirement that a plan provide for 
payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable 
plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such 
debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts 
actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in 
the SOR.10  
 
 Applicant’s testimony was credible and sincere. He has provided a valuable

obtained a second job to help ensure the necessary additional income. I conclude he 
will continue to work on resolving the remaining debts. Finally, some of Applicant's 
difficulties arose from the financial strain of raising two children on a single salary. One 
child is now self-supporting, and the other is in college. Applicant's efforts to maintain 
his home and raise his children on his own, despite his financial and medical problems, 
demonstrate maturity and strength of character.  
 
 Overall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant’s 
suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns raised by the cited adjudicative guideline.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to 
classified information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is granted.
