FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on February 26, 2009. On 
February 23, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her 
application, citing security concerns under Guideline F. DOHA acted under Executive 
Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 
1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on March 9, 2011; answered it on April 22, 2011; 
and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on 
April 25, 2011. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 3, 2011, and the 
 
2 
 
 
case was assigned to me on May 5, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 11, 
2011, scheduling the hearing for June 6, 2011. I convened the hearing as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were 
admitted without objection. I kept the record open until July 2, 2011, to enable Applicant 
to submit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX D through G, 
which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel’s comments regarding AX 
D through G are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the 
transcript (Tr.) on June 13, 2011. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. Her 
admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 47-year-old human relations specialist employed by a defense 
contractor since December 2010. (Tr. 37.) She is a college graduate, having received a 
bachelor’s degree in business administration in June 1999. She has worked for defense 
contractors since March 1994 and has held a security clearance since 1984. (Tr. 11, 
25.)  
 
 Two of Applicant’s coworkers, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and a retired 
command sergeant major, submitted statements on her behalf. They describe her as 
dedicated, exceptionally competent, honest, and trustworthy. (AX F; AX G.) 
 
 Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from May 1983 to April 1994. 
She was in the inactive U.S. Army Reserve from April 1994 to September 1999 and the 
active U.S. Army Reserve from September 1999 to the present. She holds the rank of 
sergeant first class (pay grade E-7). She was called to active duty for 90 days in June 
2008 through September 2008, and she served in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom 
and Enduring Freedom from July 2009 through February 2010. (Tr. 36.) 
 
 Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2000 and 
received a discharge in February 2001. (GX 5 at 1.) She testified that all her debt 
payments were current at the time she filed her bankruptcy petition and she had a 
“great” credit score, but she was financially overextended and filed her bankruptcy 
petition to avoid defaulting on any of her debts. (Tr. 32, 59.) 
 
 Applicant has held a real estate license since 2004. She testified that her 
experience in real estate motivated her to start acquiring investment properties. She 
testified that she has “a great passion for the real estate industry.” (Tr. 69-70.) 
 
 Applicant purchased a rental property as an investment in March 2005, and her 
monthly mortgage payments were $1,900 per month. She owes about $212,000 for this 
property. It has been rented for most of the time. She fell behind on her payments when 
the property was vacant for a short time in 2008. (GX 2 at 24.) In April 2011, she 
 
3 
 
 
negotiated a “short payoff” for $5,500, payable in six installments. (AX B.) She had 
made two of the six installment payments at the time of the hearing. The property is 
currently rented. (Tr. 46-48.) This debt is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. 
 
 Applicant purchased her primary residence, where she currently lives, in August 
2005 for about $588,000, borrowing about $400,000. She refinanced the mortgage, 
increasing the debt to $670,000. (GX 2 at 24.) She began falling behind on her 
payments in 2008. Foreclosure proceedings were initiated on this property but have 
been suspended. Applicant negotiated a payment plan in April 2009. However, at the 
time of the hearing, Applicant had not made any payments on this property for about six 
months, because she applied for a loan modification in February 2011 and was awaiting 
a decision on her application. (GX 2 at 13-17; Tr. 41-44.) As of the date the record 
closed, she had not received a modification of her loan and had not made any further 
payments. (AX D.) This debt is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. 
 
 Applicant purchased a second investment property in September 2006 for about 
$410,000. She borrowed the entire purchase price. She made the $2,800 mortgage 
payments for about a year from her own income and savings, and then rented the 
property for $1,600 per month. The mortgage on this property was foreclosed in June 
2008, but she still owes the lender about $32,000. (Tr. 39-41.) She is attempting to 
negotiate a settlement or payment plan for this debt, but she had not reached an 
agreement as of the date the record closed. (AX D.) This debt is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. 
 
 In addition to the three delinquent mortgages, the SOR also alleged six other 
delinquent debts. These debts became delinquent in 2007-2008 and were unresolved 
when a security investigator questioned Applicant about her delinquent debts in May 
2009. (GX 3 at 9-12.)  
 
 The three debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i are still unresolved. Applicant 
wrote letters to the creditors in October 2009, after she was questioned by the security 
investigator and while she was on active duty and deployed overseas. (GX 2 at 6, 7, 
11.) She received no response and “didn’t make another attempt until [she] was in 
trouble and needed to take care of these debts to secure [her] security clearance.” (Tr. 
63.) She then contacted the creditors in SOR ¶ 1.e and 1.f by telephone, but the 
creditors were unable to locate her account information because the accounts were so 
old. (Tr. 61.) She tried to telephone the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i but encountered a 
telephone message that the creditor could not take her call due to technical problems. 
(Tr. 62-63.) As of the date the record closed, the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f had not 
located her account information, and she had not made telephonic contact with the 
creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i. (AX D.) She has not asked any of the credit reporting agencies to 
verify the validity of these three debts. (Tr. 67.) 
 
Three debts alleged in the SOR were recently resolved. In April 2011, the 
delinquent $91 gas bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h was paid in full. (AX A.) In July 2011, the 
delinquent $430 telephone bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was paid in full. (AX D.) Also in July 
 
4 
 
 
2011, the delinquent satellite television bill for $392.33 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g was settled 
for $280. (AX E.) 
 
 Applicant’s net monthly income is about $6,186. She has expenses and debt 
payments of about $3,200 per month, leaving her with a net remainder of almost 
$3,000. Her debt payments are lower than they were six months ago, because she has 
not been making payments on the mortgage for her primary residence. Due in part to 
her reduced debt payments, she has accumulated about $17,000 in her checking 
account. (GX 2 at 3; Tr. 53-54.)  
 
Applicant’s security clearance application reflects that she vacationed on seven-
day winter cruises every year from 2001 through 2007. (GX 1 at 23-24.) She testified 
that she has not taken any pleasure trips since 2007. (Tr. 57.) 
 
Applicant has stated repeatedly that she is able and willing to resolve the debts 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i. (Answer to SOR; AX D; Tr. 31-32, 77.) She testified 
that she had an appointment with a credit counselor for the week following the hearing. 
(Tr. 64-65.) As of the date the record closed, she had submitted no evidence that she 
kept that appointment.  
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
 
5 
 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 
at 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges three delinquent home mortgages in amounts of about $32,000 
(SOR ¶ 1.a), $53,022 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and $43,000 (SOR ¶ 1.d); a delinquent telephone bill 
for $430 (SOR ¶ 1.c); three delinquent credit card accounts in amounts of about $2,143 
(SOR ¶ 1.e), $1,113 (SOR ¶ 1.f), and $1,025 (SOR ¶ 1.i); a delinquent satellite 
television account for $392 (SOR ¶ 1.g); and a delinquent gas bill for about $91 (SOR ¶ 
1.h). The SOR also alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 
November 2000 and received a discharge in 2001 (SOR ¶ 1.j). 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially 
 
6 
 
 
overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate 
funds. 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems arose because she purchased three homes 
between March 2005 and September 2006, including two investment properties, relying 
on potential rental income from her two investment properties to make the mortgage 
payments. For one of the investment properties, she borrowed the entire purchase 
price. Her rental income was insufficient to enable her to pay the three mortgages, her 
credit card debts, and her living expenses. The following disqualifying conditions are 
established by the evidence: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be 
indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high 
debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. 
 
 Security concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that 
“the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s 
current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.” AG ¶ 20(a). This mitigating 
condition is not established because Applicant’s debts are numerous, recent, and did 
not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. Applicant’s track record of 
overextending herself began in 2000 and continued after her bankruptcy discharge in 
2001, as she purchased real estate and gambled on the rental market to make the 
mortgage payments.  
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s 
control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical 
emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances.” AG ¶ 20(b). Applicant’s inability to rent her properties for 
amounts sufficient to cover her mortgage payments was a condition beyond her control, 
but her decision to overextend herself and gamble on the real estate rental market was 
a voluntary decision. The second prong of this mitigating condition also is not 
established because she took no meaningful steps to resolve her financial difficulties 
until after she learned from a security investigator in May 2009 that her financial 
situation raised security concerns. I conclude that this mitigating condition was not 
established.   
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear 
indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.” AG ¶ 20(c). Applicant 
testified that she intended to seek financial counseling, but she submitted no evidence 
 
7 
 
 
of counseling as of the date the record closed. This mitigating condition is not 
established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that “the 
individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve 
debts.” AG ¶ 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, 
prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 
WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  
 
An applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every 
debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial 
problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement 
that an applicant make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-
06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  
 
On the other hand, evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated when 
payment of debts is motivated by the pressure of qualifying for a security clearance 
rather than a sense of obligation. Furthermore, an applicant must do more than show 
that he or she relied on a legally available option such as bankruptcy in order to 
establish “good faith” within the meaning of this mitigating condition. See ISCR Case 
No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007). 
 
 Applicant has not resolved the delinquent mortgages alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 
1.b. She is making payments on a “short payoff” of the mortgage alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, 
but she did not resolve this debt until April 2011, even though she fell behind on her 
payments in 2008. She did not contact the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i until she 
was questioned about the debts in May 2009, and these debts remain unresolved. 
Because she had neglected her delinquent debts for so long, she had difficulty tracking 
down her creditors and retrieving her delinquent accounts. She resolved the three small 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.g, and 1.h, but only after she received the SOR and realized that 
her security clearance was in jeopardy. I conclude that AG ¶ 20(d) is not established. 
 
Security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing “the 
individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is 
the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of 
the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.” AG ¶ 20(e). This 
mitigating condition is not applicable because Applicant has not disputed any of the 
debts alleged in the SOR. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
8 
 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my 
comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Applicant is a mature, well-educated adult with a long history of public service. 
She has worked for contractors for many years, has extensive military service, and has 
held a clearance for 26 years. She has earned the respect of her coworkers. She was 
candid and sincere at the hearing.  
 
 On the other hand, Applicant also has a history of financially overextending 
herself. She became overextended because of consumer debts in 2000 and obtained a 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2001. She took expensive vacations every year from 
2001 through 2007. She purchased an investment property in March 2005, counting on 
the rental market to make the mortgage payments. She purchased her primary 
residence in August 2005, taking on the obligation of a large mortgage and increasing 
her debt by refinancing the mortgage. In 2006, she purchased a second investment 
property, borrowing the entire purchase price and again gambling on the rental market 
to make the mortgage payments. By 2007, she was again financially overextended, but 
she took no meaningful actions to resolve her delinquent debts until she realized that 
her security clearance was in jeopardy.  
 
 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and 
evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has 
not mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I 
conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue her eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.j:    Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.
