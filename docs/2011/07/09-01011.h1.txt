Decision
______________
LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny or revoke his
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows
he has a history of financial problems or difficulties. Although he did not present a
perfect case, and has not paid off each and every debt at issue, he presented sufficient
evidence to establish a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve
debts, thereby mitigating the security concerns stemming from his problematic financial
history. He did not provide deliberately false answers in response to two questions on
his security clearance application. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided
for Applicant.
  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,1
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program , dated January 2, 1992, as amended
(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified
Information (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG
were published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace
the guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.

Statement of the Case
Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 1,1
2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of
reasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and
it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline known as
Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR alleged 21 delinquent debts in
amounts ranging from $36 to $4,470 for a total of about $14,916. The 21 debts consist
of collection accounts, charged-off accounts, and an unpaid judgment; 11 debts are for
relatively small amounts (less than $250).  
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned
to me February 9, 2011. The hearing took place March 28, 2011. The transcript (Tr.)
was received April 5, 2011. 
The record was kept open for 30 days, until April 28, 2011, to provide Applicant
an opportunity to submit additional documentary information in support of his case. He
made a timely submission, and those matters are admitted, without objections, as
Exhibits P–U.  
Rulings on Procedure
The SOR was amended to correct a clerical error in SOR ¶ 2.b by changing
“subparagraphs 1.a through 1.v, above” to “subparagraphs 1.a through 1.u, above.”
Without objections, the motion to amend was granted.
Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor. His educational
background includes attending a college of aeronautics and technology during
2006–2008. He did so to facilitate a career switch to the aviation field. He had a full-time
job while in college, working as a testing technician. He was awarded a degree as an
aviation electrician in March 2008, and he began his current employment as an aircraft
electrician the same month. In addition, he is currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in
applied science. His employer is providing tuition assistance and he also receives GI Bill
benefits. He is seeking an industrial security clearance for the first time.

 Exhibits N and O. 4
 Exhibit N. 5
 Exhibit C. 6
 Exhibit D. 7

Applicant’s employment history includes military service in the U.S. Marine Corps
during 1995–2002.  While on active duty, he was trained and worked as an engineer2
equipment operator. He was honorably discharged as a sergeant, pay grade E-5. He
received two good conduct medals during his military service. Since his discharge in
November 2002, he had eight different jobs before beginning his current job in March
2008. Previously in 2005, he was terminated from one of those jobs, working as a
mechanic for a railroad, due to violation of company policy by leaving a vehicle
unattended with the engine running. Recently, he had a short-term disability for about
60 days in early 2011 due to a broken hand, and he received 75% of his covered
earnings during this period.  3
Applicant has a good employment record for his current job as verified by his
current supervisor and a recent annual evaluation.  His annual evaluation for March4
2009–March 2010 is highly favorable with an overall performance rating of “far exceeds
expectations.” His supervisor also described him in highly favorable terms as follows:
[Applicant] is one of the most reliable employees I have working for me.
His work performance and knowledge is outstanding, but the most
important item of [his] character is reliability. I have over 100 employees
working for me and I can say that I count on [Applicant] more than any of
the others. If I have a highly important (time/cost critical) task, I always
assign it to [Applicant] because I know the job will be completed ahead of
the deadline and the quality of work will be outstanding. I actually have 2
tasks on every aircraft that I will only allow him to accomplish. [Applicant]
was awarded a Top Star award this year for his outstanding work
performance and dedication to [the company].5
Applicant and his first wife separated while he was on active duty in the Marine
Corps. Thereafter, a divorce was finalized in October 2002, in which Applicant was
required to pay child support for his daughter born during the marriage.  As additional6
child support, he was ordered to provide medical support for the child. He began to fall
behind on these obligations in late 2004 after leaving his job as a detention officer at a
sheriff’s office. In time, this led an enforcement action in October 2008, when Applicant
was found in contempt for failure to pay child support and medical bills as previously
ordered.  The court determined that: (1) he was in arrears for $1,302 for the period7
 Exhibit 1. 8
 Tr. 31–32.9
 Tr. 106–109.10
 Exhibit F. 11
4
November 26, 2002, through August 1, 2008; (2) he was in arrears for $776.12 for
unpaid medical bills; and (3) he was liable for $881.40 for attorney’s fees and costs.
These unpaid medical bills are the same medical bills alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, 1.m,
1.p, and 1.u, which total $777. As a result, the court granted a cumulative judgment
against him for $2,959.52. Applicant has since paid the judgment, and he is current with
his ongoing child support obligation. None of the child support matters are alleged in the
SOR.    
Applicant married his current wife in 2007, and they have two very young
children. His wife is not employed outside the home, and in fact she receives monthly
disability compensation from the Social Security Administration. She was determined
disabled due to an assault by a former boyfriend. 
Applicant completed a security clearance application in November 2008.  In8
doing so, he did not disclose the unpaid $159 judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q in
response to the relevant question about unpaid judgments. Also, he did not disclose any
of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR in response to the relevant question about
delinquent debts. But he did disclose the following adverse information: (1) the job
termination from the railroad in 2005; (2) a single incident of domestic violence in 2008;
and (3) the child support enforcement action in 2008. He explained in his testimony that
he answered the financial questions in the negative because he did not know the details
of his financial situation, and he answered in the negative rather than answer in the
affirmative and be unable to disclose any details.  He also explained that he had no9
intention to provide false answers and was not trying to hide anything.  I found his10
explanations credible and worthy of belief. 
Concerning the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant demonstrated through his
testimony and documentary exhibits that 12 of the 21 debts are paid or settled; 2 debts
are otherwise resolved; 2 debts are in the process of repayment; 4 debts are
unresolved; and 1 debt is a duplicate. The four unresolved debts are generally the
largest individual debts and total about $9,901. In addition, he presented proof of
payment in November 2009 for a collection account not alleged in the SOR.  The11
current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is described in the following table.

Applicant’s written monthly budget reflects a household net income of $4,250,
fixed expenses of $2,790, and a net remainder of $1,460.  The budget also reflects12
$3,000 in the bank and $8,000 in a 401(k) account. He believes that his financial
situation is stabilizing due to his improved income, which has allowed him to pay his
current expenses and repay delinquent debt. He and his wife are not incurring new debt
based on credit.   
Law and Policies
This section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an
industrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide
if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of
Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously
because it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our
operations abroad. 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As13
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side of denials.”  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt14
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An15
unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security
clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  16

 See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that “the security suitability of an25
applicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness
or recurring financial difficulties.”) (citation omitted). 
7
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting17
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An18
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate19
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme20
Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21
The DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of
fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22
The AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person’s
security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions
for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense
decision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the
pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. 
The Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in
those persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a
person a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant’s loyalty.  Instead, it23
is a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has
established for granting eligibility for access.
Analysis
Under Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant24
may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline25
F is:
 AG ¶ 18.  26
 AG ¶ 19(a).  27
 AG ¶ 19(c). 28
8
 Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information.  26
Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified
information within the defense industry.   
The evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial
problems or difficulties. This raises security concerns because it indicates inability or
unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within27 28
the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying
conditions. 
There are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the
following may mitigate security concerns:  
¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good
judgment;
¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or
separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;
¶ 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem
and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is
under control;
¶ 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors
or otherwise resolve debts;
¶ 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of
the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; or 
 AG ¶¶ 15–17 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 29

¶ 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.
The most pertinent here is ¶ 20(d)—making a good-faith effort—and it is discussed
below.
Applicant’s problematic financial history appears to be due to an unstable or
inconsistent employment history since his discharge from the Marine Corps in 2002. It
was probably made more difficult by his legal and moral obligation to pay child support
and associated medical bills for his daughter, because once he fell behind, it was
difficult to become current. It came to a head with the enforcement action in 2008, and
he is now current on all child support matters. Roughly concurrent with his resolving the
child support matter, he completed college and began a new career as an aircraft
electrician in 2008. Since then, his employment and finances have become more stable
or consistent. He is doing quite well at work and is pursuing further education to improve
his prospects with his employer. 
Applicant has also been able to pay his current expenses and successfully
address many of his delinquent debts. As set forth in the table above, 12 of the 21 debts
are paid or settled; 2 debts are otherwise resolved; 2 debts are in the process of
repayment; 4 debts are unresolved; and 1 debt is a duplicate. The four unresolved
debts are generally the largest individual debts and total about $9,901. In addition, he
presented proof of payment in November 2009 for a collection account not alleged in
the SOR. And unlike many applicants in financial cases, he did a good job of providing
documentary evidence to support or corroborate his representations about his efforts to
address the debts. His written monthly budget reflects a positive net remainder of more
than $1,000, and he is beginning to accumulate a small amount of financial assets. This
money will allow him to address his outstanding delinquent debts. Although he did not
present a perfect case, and has not paid off each and every debt in the SOR, he has
made substantial progress. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that
Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise
resolve debts, thereby mitigating the security concerns stemming from his problematic
financial history. 
Under Guideline E for personal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be29
questioned or put into doubt due to false statements and credible adverse information
that may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. The overall
concern under Guideline E is:  
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to
protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide
 AG ¶ 15. 30
 AG ¶ 2(a)(1)–(9). 31
10
truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any
other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  30
A statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission
of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about
it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the
information did not need to be reported. 
The issue here is whether Applicant made deliberately false statements when
answering two questions about his financial record on his 2008 security clearance
application. Based on the evidence, to include his hearing testimony, which I found
credible, I am not persuaded he made deliberately false statements. He answered the
questions in the negative because he did not know the details of his financial situation.
Any intent to willfully falsify is rebutted by his willingness to disclose: (1) the job
termination from the railroad in 2005; (2) a single incident of domestic violence in 2008;
and (3) the child support enforcement action in 2008. Given those disclosures, I am not
persuaded that he was attempting to mislead or conceal adverse financial information in
order to put his security clearance application in a more favorable light.    
To conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to overcome the security
concerns, and I am persuaded that he will exercise the required good judgment,
reliability, and trustworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to
the nine factors of the whole-person concept.  He received favorable consideration for31
his honorable military service, his current good employment record, and his improving
overall financial situation. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden
of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for
Applicant. 
Formal Findings
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:
Paragraph 1, Guideline F: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a–1.u: For Applicant
Paragraph 2, Guideline E: For Applicant
Subparagraphs 2.a–2.b: For Applicant
11
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest
to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified
information is granted.
