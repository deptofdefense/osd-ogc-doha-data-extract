GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the criminal conduct and financial considerations security 
concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 17, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal 
conduct) and Guideline F (financial considerations). The action was taken under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and 
the adjudicative guidelines (AG).1 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on September 21, 2016, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 20, 2017. 
                                                     
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
August 2, 2017, scheduling the hearing for August 30, 2017. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. 
 
 I appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) 1-3, respectively, the 
Government’s discovery letter and exhibit list, and Applicant’s exhibit list. I admitted 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 and 6 through 11 in evidence without objection. 
Counsel objected to GE 4 and 5, on the basis that they were reports of investigation and 
could not be admitted without an authenticating witness. I overruled counsel’s 
objections and admitted GE 4 and 5 in evidence.2 Applicant testified, called four 
witnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through U, which I admitted in 
evidence without objection.                                                                                                                       
  
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until September 13, 2017, for the submission of additional documentation. 
Applicant timely provided additional evidence, which I marked as AE V through Z and 
admitted in evidence without objection. I marked Applicant’s continued exhibit list as HE 
4. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 8, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted in part and denied in part SOR ¶ 1.a, and denied SOR ¶ 2.a. 
He is 37 years old. He has worked as an analyst for a defense contractor since June 
2015. He worked for the same defense contractor from April 2011 until he was laid off in 
December 2014, and he worked solely in a part-time capacity from January through 
June 2015. He was first granted a DOD security clearance at the age of 18. In August 
2007, his clearance was granted with a warning that failure to resolve any delinquent 
debts or any other subsequent unfavorable information may result in suspension. 
Applicant did not recall receiving documentation of the warning, but he recalled that he 
was told to keep his debts current. In June 2014, his clearance was suspended.3 
 
 Applicant earned an associate’s degree in 2006 and a bachelor’s degree in 2010. 
As of the hearing, he was in the process of obtaining a master’s degree. He married in 
2001, divorced in 2003, and remarried in 2009. He has three children.4   
 
 Applicant enlisted and served on active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1998 
until December 2001, when he received an honorable discharge due to medical 
conditions. He re-enlisted in March 2005 and was honorably discharged in September 
2005, due to limitations as a result of an injury. He then served in the National Guard 
(NG) for state A beginning in October 2005. He was selected for and attended Officer 
Candidate School (OCS) from February 2006 to August 2007, upon which time he was

commissioned as an officer. He served in the officer accession task force from July 
2007 to April 2008; he trained to become an analyst from April to September 2008; he 
deployed overseas from 2008 to late 2010; upon his 2010 return from overseas 
deployment, he served as an officer. He received a General Under Honorable 
Conditions discharge from the NG in April 2014.5 
 
  The SOR alleges that an April 2012 investigation by the U.S. Army revealed that, 
between 2007 and 2008, Applicant knowingly received $30,600 in Student Loan 
Repayment Program (SLRP) funds and a $20,000 Officer Accession Bonus (OAB), for 
which he was unauthorized. In May 2014, he was charged in state A with felony grand 
theft and fraud. He pled guilty to misdemeanor larceny. He was sentenced to 100 hours 
of community service, four years of probation, and ordered to pay at least $30,600 in 
restitution. The SOR also alleges that Applicant owes the U.S. Government 
approximately $30,600 in restitution.  
 
  Applicant served in the NG under state Title 32 orders. From July 2007 to 
August 2010, he was activated under federal Title 10 orders with a Military Occupational 
Specialty (MOS) of 35D, which is a commissioned officer specialty. As a commissioned 
officer, he had the ability to serve under Title 10 orders and command federal troops. 
His stated purpose in his Title 10 orders, during the period from July 2007 to April 2008, 
was “Army Reserve National Guard RNR Global War on Terrorism Active Duty Special 
Work Specialty Recruiting,” which caused confusion as to whether he was a recruiter. 
Within the U.S. military, only enlisted members with the requisite training were 
authorized to carry the title of recruiter. Within the U.S. Army, the MOS for a recruiter 
was 79R, and such individuals received specific, recruiter-focused training and 
guidance, as well as additional training in bonuses and incentives. Officers could not be 
recruiters.6  
 
 Applicant maintained he was not a recruiter, though he may have subjectively 
and on occasion referred to himself as one. He never received training or education in 
special incentive bonuses or student loan repayments while he was an infantryman in 
the U.S. Army or while he served in the NG. He provided information to serving state 
NG members and individuals enlisted in The Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), 
about the ways in which they could become commissioned officers in the U.S. Army. He 
also provided training and preparation for noncommissioned and warrant officers.7  
  
 A retired major, Applicant’s then-officer-in-charge and immediate supervisor, 
stated in a 2013 letter that Applicant’s duties during the period from July 2007 through 
April 2008 did not include recruiting applicants into the NG. The retired major stated that 
Applicant was not a recruiter with the MOS 79R. In addition, one of Applicant’s 
witnesses, the northern field commander for recruiting and retention for the NG in state 
A and an armed forces member for 26 years, served on the same team as Applicant

during the 2007 to 2010 timeframe. She testified that neither she nor Applicant were 
recruiters. The confusion as to whether Applicant was a recruiter led to his charges, as 
discussed below.8   
 
 In 2006, while in an infantry battalion serving the NG and also while in OCS, 
Applicant learned from his command about a pre-commissioning, personal loan. The 
loan was available only to those individuals who were students in service academies, 
the ROTC, or in OCS, or any individual who received a commission one year prior to 
applying for the loan. In July 2006, while in OCS but not yet a commissioned officer, and 
while enrolled in college full-time, Applicant obtained the loan in the amount of $25,000. 
He used the loan to pay his school and living expenses, as he would have with any 
federal student loan. He did not recall whether he used some of the loan money to pay 
the balance on a repossessed car loan. He intended to repay the loan upon 
commission.9 
  
 In September 2007, Applicant met a master sergeant at an accession task force 
conference, who was then the incentive and bonus manager and subject-matter expert 
for state A’s NG. The master sergeant’s role at the conference was to provide training to 
enlisted recruiters. During the conference, she inquired of Applicant whether he had any 
student loans, and he informed her of his $6,000 Stafford student loan. He could not 
recall when he incurred the loan, but he recalled that he received it as an enlisted 
member while he attended college for either his associate’s or bachelor’s degree. He 
inquired of the master sergeant whether his student loan was eligible for repayment, 
given that he had just been commissioned as an officer two months prior. The master 
sergeant informed him that it was, so long as he received the student loan while he was 
enlisted, prior to becoming an officer. He then provided her with a summary sheet 
containing the student loan institution’s name, his loan account number, and the loan 
balance. His student loan was subsequently paid directly to the student loan provider.10  
 
 In approximately late 2007 or early 2008, Applicant interacted with the master 
sergeant a second time, when he went to the master sergeant’s headquarters office for 
a training event. Prior to their interaction, Applicant had learned from another officer, a 
colleague with whom he worked on the accession task force and who received the 
same pre-commissioning, personal loan as Applicant did in 2006, that the master 
sergeant had indicated the loan might be eligible for repayment through the SLRP since 
it was incurred while enlisted and prior to being commissioned as an officer. Applicant 
inquired of the master sergeant whether his pre-commissioning, personal loan was 
eligible for repayment, since he used it while he attended school full-time to offset 
school and living expenses. At the master sergeant’s request, he provided her with the 
account number, institution name, remaining loan balance, and banking information by 
email. He did not provide her with documentation from the loan provider or an 
accounting of his use of the loan money, as he followed her instructions and relied on

her as the subject-matter expert. In March 2008, a $24,000 payment was made directly 
to the loan’s banking institution with the money from the SLRP.11 
 
  When Applicant enlisted in the NG, he learned that he was eligible for and he 
received a $15,000 Prior Service Enlistment Bonus (PSEB). In 2007, he learned that he 
was eligible for and he received a $20,000 OAB, available to all officers upon 
completion of their officer basic course and who were in a specialty skill MOS or 
deploying. As he had completed his officer basic course in September 2008, was an 
officer, and was on deployment orders by November 2008, he submitted paperwork to 
the master sergeant for his bonus. He did so under the direction of the OCS leadership. 
He did not specifically reference the $20,000 OAB. He subsequently received the 
$20,000 OAB in November 2008, in four payments of $5,000.12 
 
 Applicant understood that the master sergeant’s job was to provide guidance to 
recruiters and enlisted members. He understood that he was neither at the time. He did 
not think to consult with an individual authorized to provide guidance to an officer, like 
himself, because he received the student loan and the pre-commissioning loan while he 
was an enlisted member. He also trusted that the master sergeant knew, as the state’s 
subject-matter expert, which bonuses he was entitled to receive. He believed that even 
if he had sought additional guidance, he would have been referred back to the master 
sergeant since she was the subject-matter expert. He acknowledged that he knows 
better now.13 
 
 The first time it occurred to Applicant that the master sergeant had done 
something wrong was in 2010, after the DOD Office of the Inspector General had begun 
their investigation into the master sergeant. Prior to meeting the master sergeant in 
September 2007, and up through his second interaction with her in early 2008, 
Applicant had not heard rumors that the master sergeant was paying loans that were 
not so entitled. He had not been told to specifically ask the master sergeant for 
repayment of loans that were ineligible. He did not give the master sergeant anything to 
obtain repayment or in return for her processing of his repayments. He was friendly 
towards her as a matter of course, and he gave her M&M candies and possibly an M&M 
keychain because he knew she liked M&M’s. He did not consider these minimally 
valued items to be gifts.14 
 
 Subsequent to the master sergeant’s retirement from the NG, an investigation led 
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), into the bonuses and incentives paid 
during her tenure, culminated in her 2011 conviction in state superior court for 
misappropriation of federal funds. She was ordered to repay the U.S. Government 
$15,200,000 and serve 30 months in a federal correction facility. She admitted to

knowingly processing ineligible bonuses and incentives on behalf of her fellow NG 
members, due to her anger with the NG’s leadership.15 
 
 In April 2012, the NG issued Applicant a General Officer Memorandum of 
Reprimand (GOMR). The GOMR stated that he knowingly received $30,600 from the 
SLRP, the $15,000 PSEB, and the $20,000 OAB, for which he was not entitled. 
Applicant testified that the GOMR was based on his Title 10 orders and the improper 
assumption that he was a recruiter with the requisite training. He also testified that the 
state NG’s determination was premature.16  
 
 Applicant was tried by court-martial under state A’s NG judicial system, for 
violations of Article 92 (failure to obey order or regulation), Article 121 (larceny and 
wrongful appropriation of property), and Article 132 (fraud against the United States). 
He was alleged to have committed larceny in the sum of $30,600 from the SLRP. 
During the court-martial proceedings, Applicant worked as a defense contractor in state 
B. Thus, the NG would put him on orders, and he would then fly to state A to attend the 
proceedings. The case was dismissed in March 2013 due to jurisdictional issues.17  
 
 In April 2014, Applicant was charged in a civilian capacity in state A superior 
court with felony grand theft of $30,600 from the SLRP. As Applicant was working in 
state B, he incurred $1,600 in monthly travel expenses to attend the hearings in state A. 
When his clearance was suspended in June 2014, his ability to work as a defense 
contractor was harmed. He consequently received a layoff notice and a 37% pay 
deduction. His wife was not working full time, as he was his family’s sole breadwinner. 
Balancing the costs of flying between state B and state A against the potential timeline 
of 12 to 24 months before his case would go to trial, Applicant decided to take the 
prosecution’s deal in May 2015. He pled guilty to misdemeanor larceny. In addition to 
Applicant, the NG prosecuted and obtained guilty pleas from three other individuals. At 
the time of his plea, he understood the implications that a felony conviction could have 
on his clearance. His attorney did not advise him of the full implications that a 
misdemeanor criminal conviction could have on his clearance.18 
  
 Applicant understood that he pled guilty to the misdemeanor larceny charge. He 
understood that his guilty plea meant that he took responsibility for the charge. He was 
sentenced to one year in jail, suspended; four years of probation; 100 days of 
community service; and ordered to pay $30,600 in restitution to the Defense Finance 
and Accounting Service (DFAS). He remains on probation until March 2019, though he 
may be found to have fulfilled his probation requirement earlier, upon successful 
completion of his community service and full $30,600 restitution to DFAS. As of the 
hearing date, he completed 25 days of community service, as his ability to perform

labor-intensive service was hampered by his back injury, in which he has a 70% 
disability rating from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He located an 
alternate community service organization through which he intended to fulfill the 
remaining court-ordered community service. In accordance with a repayment schedule 
he reached with DFAS prior to the commencement of the state criminal proceedings, he 
had also made 23 payments at $50 to $100 monthly, with his last payment in May 2017, 
as further discussed below.19  
 
 Applicant received a June 2017 letter from the Army Board of Correction of 
Military Records (ABMCR). In that letter, the ABMCR indicated that as he was one of 
the NG members that had a debt action or certified recoupment with the DFAS, it had 
received an advisory opinion from the National Guard Bureau (NGB) and it could adopt 
the opinion’s recommendations wholly or partially, or reject them altogether. The NGB’s 
advisory opinion stated that as a commissioned officer, Applicant was ineligible for 
money from the SLRP; Applicant, in his rebuttal to the GOMR, contended that he was 
informed by the master sergeant that he was eligible; and while there was no definitive 
evidence to support Applicant’s contention, there was also no definitive evidence to 
demonstrate that he acted deceitfully or with intent to defraud the U.S. Government.20  
 
 The NGB’s opinion continued to state that the GOMR did not provide definitive 
evidence to support Applicant’s knowledge of wrongdoing, but merely suggested that  
he should have known he was ineligible for the SLRP because of his position as an 
officer recruiter, though that position was a temporary one in which he lacked any formal 
training. It stated that while the pre-commissioning, personal loan Applicant received 
payment toward was not a qualifying education loan, “. . . it was reasonable to see how 
he may have found it feasible that he could qualify for such payment with his peers 
receiving the same incentive and the subject matter expert validating his eligibility.” The 
opinion concluded that based on the above-stated factors and Applicant’s good service, 
Applicant could retain the $30,600 SLRP incentive offered to him by the NG. It also 
concluded that Applicant should repay portions of both the OAB and the PSEB totaling 
$17,500, for which he was ineligible.21 
  
 Applicant responded to the ABMCR’s letter and requested that, should it agree 
with the NGB’s conclusion that he repay $17,500, he receive credit for any payments he 
previously made to DFAS directly and through payroll deductions. In June 2017, the 
ABMCR granted Applicant full relief in its final determination and waived its opportunity 
to recoup any money from him. As such, the ABMCR approved the request for waiver of 
recoupment of the $15,000 PSEB incentive, the $20,000 OAB incentive, and the 
$30,600 SLRP incentive, and Applicant was to be reimbursed for any previously 
recouped money. The ABMCR stated that it was “. . . unable to determine that Applicant 
knew, or reasonably should have known, that he was ineligible for all the incentive pay 
he received,” as he heavily relied on the state incentive manager regarding his eligibility.

It stated that its conclusion was based on the irreconcilable administrative errors 
presented in the evidence. It further stated that its decision would be forwarded to the 
NGB, who would then take action to correct Applicant’s records.22 
  
 As of the hearing, the ABMCR refunded approximately $3,246 in money 
garnished from Applicant’s prior military pay and payments he previously made directly 
to DFAS after he left service in April 2014. DFAS documentation from July 2017 
reflected that the account status for Applicant’s out-of-service debt carried a zero 
balance. Whereas while he was in service, he received a letter from the state NG 
incentive task force in the summer of 2012, notifying him that his payroll would be 
deducted to repay the SLRP money he received at 20%, rather than 80%, because it 
had concluded that he received the money at no fault of his own. In addition, when he 
left service, DFAS notified him by letter that he owed $65,000, comprised of the totality 
of money he received from the SLRP, the OAB, and the PEB. Applicant testified that the 
DFAS zero balance and the ABMCR’s refund of his payments reflected the U.S. 
Government’s waiver of its opportunity to recoup the money, thereby forgiving his debt. 
Though the state A superior court ordered Applicant to repay the restitution to DFAS, 
Applicant did not provide evidence to show that the ABMCR’s determination supplanted 
the sentence by state A’s superior court, or that the state superior court accepted the 
DFAS zero balance as satisfaction of its order.23  
 
 Applicant recently discovered exculpatory information in prosecution transcripts 
for the convicted master sergeant that he was not provided in discovery prior to his 
guilty plea. Consequently, he hired counsel who filed a motion in August 2017 to 
withdraw his guilty plea. The motion was accompanied by the ABMCR’s determination 
that Applicant did not deceitfully intend to defraud the U.S. Government. Applicant also 
intended to provide the exculpatory information contained in the prosecution transcripts 
for the master sergeant and the DFAS documentation reflecting a zero balance.24  
 
 Applicant’s witnesses at hearing described him as a trustworthy, hard-working, 
ethical, loyal, and transparent individual with unquestionable integrity. Those who 
worked with him also described him as a stellar employee. His character references 
described him in the same manner. His defense contractor commended his 
performance in 2012, and gave him the highest rating of “far exceeds expectations” in 
2015 to 2016. He was rated “fully qualified” or “best qualified” in officer evaluation

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis  
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct  
 
AG ¶ 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
AG ¶ 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. I considered the following relevant: 
(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; 
 
(c) individual is currently on parole or probation; and 
 
(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than 
“Honorable.” 
 
Applicant argued that he unknowingly received funds totaling $65,000 from the 
SLRP, the OAB, and the PEB, because he relied on the guidance provided him by the 
incentive and bonus manager, and subject-matter expert, for state A’s NG. He also 
argued that his charges stemmed from the erroneous conclusion that he was a 
recruiter. But he pled guilty in 2014 to misdemeanor larceny, and he understood that by 
doing so, he took responsibility for the charge. AG ¶ 31(b) applies. 
 
Applicant remains on probation until March 2019. AG ¶ 31(c) applies. 
 
Applicant received a General Under Honorable Conditions discharge from the 
NG in April 2014. AG ¶ 31(e) does not apply. 
I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 32 and considered 
the following relevant:  
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment;  
(c) no reliable evidence that the individual committed the offense; and 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited 
to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, 
compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher 
 
11 
 
education, good employment record, or constructive community 
involvement. 
As stated above, Applicant understood that his guilty plea to misdemeanor 
larceny meant that he took responsibility for the charge. AG ¶ 32(c) does not apply. 
 
Applicant’s 2014 misdemeanor criminal conviction is a significant blemish on his 
otherwise stellar record. It happened under such unusual circumstances that are 
unlikely to recur, as already discussed above. Though he argued that he unknowingly 
received the funds because he relied on the master sergeant’s guidance, and that his 
charges stemmed from the erroneous conclusion that he was a recruiter, he 
acknowledged that he took responsibility by pleading guilty to the misdemeanor larceny 
charge. I conclude that there is no doubt about Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and judgment. AG ¶ 32(a) applies. 
 
While Applicant remains on probation until March 2019, there is evidence of 
successful rehabilitation. He has an otherwise stellar record. He may be found to have 
fulfilled his probation requirement earlier, upon successful completion of his community 
service and full $30,600 restitution to DFAS. He completed 25 days of the court-ordered 
100 days of community service. He located an alternate community service organization 
through which he intended to fulfill his remaining obligation. He made 23 payments to 
DFAS at $50 to $100 monthly until May 2017, in accordance with a repayment schedule 
he reached with DFAS prior to the commencement of the state criminal proceedings. 
DFAS documentation from July 2017 reflected that the account status for his out-of- 
service debt carried a zero balance. The ABMCR, after its June 2017 final determination 
in which it granted full relief to Applicant and waived its opportunity to recoup any 
money from him, refunded him $3,246 in money garnished from his prior military pay 
and payments he previously made directly to DFAS after he left service in April 2014.  
 
Applicant did not provide evidence to show that the ABMCR’s determination 
supplanted the sentence by state A’s superior court. He also did not provide evidence to 
show that the state superior court accepted the DFAS zero balance as satisfaction of its 
order. However, he filed with his August 2017 motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the 
ABMCR’s determination that he did not deceitfully intend to defraud the U.S. 
Government. He also intended to provide the superior court with the exculpatory 
information contained in the prosecution transcripts for the master sergeant and the 
DFAS documentation reflecting a zero balance. Applicant’s actions demonstrate his 
efforts at continuing to comply with the superior court’s order. AG ¶ 32(d) applies. 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
 
12 
 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement,  
employee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing 
deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. 
 
 Applicant was ordered by the superior court of state A to repay the U.S. 
Government $30,600 in restitution as part of his guilty plea to misdemeanor larceny. 
Though he argued that he did not intentionally engage in deceptive financial practices, 
he understood that he took responsibility for the charge by pleading guilty to it. AG ¶ 
19(d) applies.  
 
 AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) do not apply. Applicant has had the financial 
ability to comply with the court’s order that he repay the U.S. Government $30,600 in 
restitution, as he has worked for a defense contractor in some capacity since at least 
April 2011. He reached a repayment schedule with and began paying DFAS prior to the 
commencement of the state criminal proceedings. He complied with the repayment 
schedule and made 23 payments to DFAS at $50 to $100 monthly until May 2017. 
DFAS documentation from July 2017 reflected that his account status for his out-of-
service debt carried a zero balance. The ABMCR, after its June 2017 final determination 
in which it granted full relief to Applicant, refunded him $3,246 in money garnished from 
his prior military pay and payments he previously made directly to DFAS after he left 
service in April 2014.  
 
 Applicant did not provide evidence to show that the ABMCR’s determination 
supplanted the sentence by state A’s superior court, or that the state superior court 
accepted the DFAS zero balance as satisfaction of its order. However, he filed with his 
August 2017 motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the ABMCR’s determination that he did 
not deceitfully intend to defraud the U.S. Government. He also intended to provide the 
superior court with the exculpatory information contained in the prosecution transcripts 
for the master sergeant and the DFAS documentation reflecting a zero balance. 
Applicant’s actions demonstrate his efforts at continuing to comply with the superior 
court’s order to repay the U.S. Government its full restitution.  
 
13 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 Though Applicant argued that he unknowingly received the funds because he 
relied on the master sergeant’s guidance, and that his charges stemmed from the 
erroneous conclusion that he was a recruiter, he acknowledged that he took 
responsibility by pleading guilty to the misdemeanor larceny charge. As such, AG ¶ 
20(b) does not apply. 
 
For the same reasons discussed above under my Guideline J analysis, I 
conclude that AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(d), and 20(e) apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
14 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline J and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
I have considered Applicant’s record in its totality, to include his stellar 
performance in the U.S. military and his overseas deployment, prior to his 2014 
misdemeanor criminal conviction. I have considered his commendable performance for 
a U.S. defense contractor since then. Applicant credibly testified at hearing that he has 
taken responsibility for his conviction, and there is sufficient evidence to show that he is 
committed to complying with the court’s order.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the criminal conduct and financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline J:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant  
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
