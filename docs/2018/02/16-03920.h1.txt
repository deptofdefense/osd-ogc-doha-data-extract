GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On April 13, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On February 10, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1 The SOR 
                                                          
 
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for 
 
2 
                                      
 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed 
reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR 
recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance 
should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on February 20, 2017. On March 7, 2017, he 
responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. 
Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on March 24, 
2017. The case was assigned to me on May 26, 2017.  A Notice of Hearing was issued 
on August 3, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 22, 2017. 
 
 During the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5, and four 
Applicant exhibits (AE) A through AE D were admitted into evidence without objection. 
Applicant and one witness testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 30, 2017. 
I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that 
opportunity and timely submitted several documents, which were marked and admitted 
as AE E through AE O, without objection. The record closed on October 13, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, nearly all of the 
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.j., and 1.l.) in 
the SOR. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
software development analyst with the company since April 2015. He previously held a 
variety of full-time or part-time positions with other employers as a systems analyst, 
network technician, concrete fabricator, server, sales representative, computer 
technician, salesman, and installer. From 2009 until at least 2016, he was self-employed 
on a part-time basis. He is a 2003 high school graduate, with a 2009 associate’s degree 
in computer networking, and a 2011 bachelor’s degree in network security.  He is currently 
working towards a master’s degree in systems engineering. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. 
Air Force in December 2003, and he was honorably discharged as an airman first class 
(E-3) in December 2007.2 Applicant was granted a secret security clearance with special 
access in 2004, and a top secret security clearance in 2013. Applicant was married in 
November 2005, and divorced in July 2009. He has two children, born in 2006 and 2008.  
 
                                                          
access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were established to supersede all previously 
issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. Accordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on 
September 1, 2006, under which this security clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the 
two versions, there is no substantial difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case. 
 
2 Applicant was reduced in grade from E-4 to E-3 as a result of disciplinary punishment under Article 15, 
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violation of Article 92, failure to obey a lawful general order by wrongfully 
consuming an alcoholic beverage in a dry country (Iraq).

Military Service, Awards, and Decorations 
 
 During his military service, Applicant was stationed in Iraq from September 2006 
until January 2007, frequently coming under enemy fire. He was awarded the Air Force 
Outstanding Unit Award, the National Defense Service medal, the Global War on 
Terrorism Service Medal, and the Air Force Training Ribbon.3 
 
Financial Considerations4 
It is unclear when Applicant first started experiencing financial problems. A review 
of his August 2012 credit report reveals a 2011 judgment, a 2011 bankruptcy, and a 
number of accounts that were delinquent as early as 2009 and 2010, during a period that 
the national economy was floundering. Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to 
“significant debt which he could not manage from his wages, the inconsistent pattern of 
his jobs, taking courses toward his degree, the expense of commuting long distances to 
work, and to alleviate debt which kept him from paying child support.”5 An added financial 
burden was caused when his father opened several accounts in Applicant’s name without 
Applicant’s knowledge, and ran up approximately $30,000 in debt that his father, and 
later, Applicant, could not pay. Exacerbating his financial problems was the final divorce 
degree in November 2009 that required him to pay more than $12,700 in child-support 
arrearage commencing in December 2009.6  
The SOR identified a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy and 13 purportedly delinquent 
accounts that had been placed for collection or charged off, or filed as a judgment, as 
generally reflected by Applicant’s August 2012 credit report, May 2015 credit report, or 
December 2016 credit report. Those debts total approximately $89,770. The current 
status of those accounts, according to the credit reports, other evidence submitted by the 
Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments regarding same, is as follows. 
 (SOR ¶ 1.a.): Applicant was ordered by one state to pay child support for his two 
children who later moved to another state, and then to still another state. He 
acknowledged that he was unable to make the full monthly payments, and an arrearage 
developed. The December 2016 credit report lists the unpaid balance as $28,910 and the 
past-due amount as $5,896.7 In November 2013, an Income Withholding for Support

Order was issued requiring that Applicant’s employer withhold $800 per month.8 The 
Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Trustee acknowledged in June 2014 that $8,344.58 was paid 
towards the arrearage.9 In addition, commencing in June 2016 and continuing through 
May 2017, $1,000 per month was generally withheld from Applicant’s salary.10 The 
original order was $800 for child support and $200 for arrearage, but it was subsequently 
modified and reduced to a total of $500 per month.11 The Income Withholding for Support 
Order was terminated on May 25, 2017.12 During the first six months of 2017, $5,500 was 
withheld from Applicant’s salary, and because the termination order was not timely 
received by his employer, at least one additional withholding took place.13 Applicant is 
awaiting correspondence and an accounting regarding his continuing obligations from the 
most recent state of his ex-wife’s residence. The account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. through 1.h.): seven student loans in varying amounts ($16,333 
charged off, and the remaining accounts in collection: $7,482; $6,635; $4,759; $3,511; 
$3,310; and $2,115), totaling $44,145.14 Applicant contended that several accounts were 
alleged as separate accounts, when in reality, they were different time-line versions of the 
same account. The SOR alleged that $16,333 was charged off, but the credit reports 
reflect that only $14,226 was charged off in February 2015, and there is an unpaid 
balance of $16,333, of which $4,880 was past due.15 After a period of forbearance, 
several accounts were defaulted, and a number of them were transferred or sold, or 
assigned to the Government. Three accounts with the U.S. Department of Education with 
the same account number have different unpaid balances of $7,482, $6,635, and $3,310. 
Three other accounts with the U.S. Department of Education with the same account 
number, but different from the first three accounts, have different unpaid balances of 
$4,759, $3,511, and $2,115. Applicant made payments of approximately $124 per month 
for four months, and then stopped because of insufficient funds to continue making those

14 GE 3, supra note 4; GE 5, supra note 4; GE 5, supra note 4. The evidence submitted by the Government is 
internally inconsistent. For example, GE 3 reflects 13 student loan accounts, 12 of which have different account 
numbers, and 2 accounts with different creditors sharing the same account number, spread among 4 different sources 
(U.S. Department of Education, Sallie Mae, Navient, and ACS Loan Servicing); GE 4 reflects 15 student loan accounts, 
some with entirely different account numbers, spread among 4 different sources (U.S. Department of Education, Sallie 
Mae, Navient, and SLM Financial); and GE 5 reflects 23 student loan accounts, with a variety of different accounts 
numbers, or partial numbers, spread among 3 different sources (with U.S. Department of Education, Sallie Mae, and 
Navient). Several account numbers are repeated with different account balances and different statuses.

payments.16 Despite the various differences in the available information regarding the 
student loans, in August 2017, a Wage Garnishment Order was issued by a collection 
agent acting on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education directing that effective 
October 6, 2017, 15 percent of Applicant’s disposable earnings was to be withheld from 
his salary. The total amount owed was $55,710.25, plus interest.17 The first garnished 
amount of $266.16 was paid on October 6, 2017.18 As an aside, Applicant indicated that 
the school he attended was shut down in September 2016 because it had lost its 
accreditation. He claimed that recently enrolled students are now eligible to apply for debt 
forgiveness. Applicant submitted a Proof of Claim in the school’s bankruptcy case on 
August 22, 2017,19 and he is awaiting the result of the bankruptcy court’s decision. 
Nevertheless, with the garnishment in place, the account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.i.): a credit-union credit card with a $500 credit limit and unpaid and past- 
due balance of $642 that was charged off.20 The account was included in Applicant’s 
bankruptcy, and no claim was asserted.21 In other words, it was disallowed. Nevertheless, 
on September 28, 2017, Applicant paid the creditor $642.75.22 The account has been 
resolved.  
(SOR ¶ 1.j.): a medical account with an unidentified provider with an unpaid 
balance of $70.23 At the time of the service, Applicant presented the provider with his 
insurance card and paid a $60 co-pay. The insurance company paid its portion of the bill, 
and the unpaid balance was in dispute because the physician was unable to properly 
treat Applicant. Applicant paid the creditor $70 on September 26, 2017.24 The account 
has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.k., 1.m., and 1.n.): three credit cards with unpaid balances of $4,973 
(that went to judgment); $7,879; and $3,151.25 Applicant disputed the accounts, and he 
denied applying for the cards and did not authorize anyone to do so, or use them, in his

name.26 In his e-QIP, Applicant contended that “a relative” had applied for the cards,27 
and during the hearing he identified the relative as his father. He chose not to officially 
dispute the accounts because he did not want his father to get charged with fraud.28 
Applicant’s father testified and stated that when Applicant first joined the U.S. Air Force, 
he was struggling financially because he had no credit history. Without Applicant’s 
knowledge, he decided to assist his son by responding to some of the mail solicitations 
that offered credit. The purpose was to build up credit by making purchases in Applicant’s 
name and eventually pay them off. He paid off two or three accounts, but when the 
economic collapse of 2009 occurred, he lost both of his jobs, and his monthly income 
dropped from $10,000 down to $1,800, and no further payments could be made.29 He 
recommended that Applicant file for bankruptcy under Chapter 7, but Applicant chose to 
file under Chapter 13. To “rectify” his guilt, he paid off Applicant’s vehicle for about 
$12,000.30 Although the three accounts were identified in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, no 
payments were made to them by the Trustee. Applicant has not made any payments once 
the bankruptcy was dismissed. The accounts have not been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.l.): a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy was filed by Applicant on November 11, 
2011; the plan was confirmed on January 24, 2012; and it was dismissed on April 21, 
2014. During the pendency of the bankruptcy, Applicant made $10,180 in payments to 
the Trustee, and $8,344.58 of that amount was paid towards Applicant’s child-support 
obligations.31 
During the hearing, Applicant was requested to submit a Personal Financial 
Statement. He failed to do so. Instead, in October 2017, he submitted both his by-weekly 
Earning Statements and a budget to reflect his monthly income and monthly expenses. 
His by-weekly net income is generally between $1,470 and $1,736, depending on his 
student-loan garnishment, or a monthly average over a period of six months of $3,324; 
and his monthly expenses are generally $2,498. He estimated that he has a monthly 
remainder of $826 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.32 In 
addition to the SOR-related debts, Applicant has paid off other debts.33 Other than the 
delinquent debts listed above, Applicant has no other delinquent accounts. There is no 
evidence of financial counseling. Nevertheless, Applicant has made significant progress 
in stabilizing his finances and avoiding other financial delinquencies. He resolved several 
of the SOR accounts either through direct payments, through his Chapter 13 bankruptcy,

or by garnishments, and is currently focusing on his student loans (through garnishment) 
and the three remaining delinquent SOR accounts that were generated by his father. 
Once he is granted his security clearance, he expects to receive an increase in pay, and 
his finances will be even better controlled. 
Work Performance and Character References 
 Applicant was characterized in one performance review as “a solid performer who 
has performed all his duties in a highly satisfactory manner and presents a professional 
manner to his peers and customers. He consistently meets . . . goals . . . resulting in 
remarkably high customer satisfaction ratings.”34 Another rater noted that “[w]e found that 
this work wasn’t keeping him challenged and could take on more complex work.”35 
Applicant’s father, a retired Air Force major, commented on Applicant’s reputation for 
honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness. He noted that Applicant routinely returned change 
that was more than that to which he was entitled, whether it was $10 or $0.35.36  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”37 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”38   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known

as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”39 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.40  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”41  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”42 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG 19:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other 
negative financial indicators. 
 
Applicant’s student loans went into default, his child support developed a 
significant arrearage, and several accounts became delinquent. A judgment was filed 
against him. He filed for bankruptcy in 2011. There is no evidence that he was unwilling 
to satisfy his debts or that he had the ability to do so, and there is no evidence of frivolous 
or irresponsible spending, or consistent spending beyond his means. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 
19(c) have been established, and AG ¶ 19(e) has been partially established. AG ¶ 19(b) 
has not been established. 
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: 
 
 
10 
                                      
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;43 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.  
I have concluded that ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all partially or fully 
apply. A number of accounts became delinquent as early as 2009. Applicant attributed 
his financial difficulties to a variety of factors including the inconsistent pattern of his jobs, 
taking college courses, the expense of commuting long distances to work, and child 
support. Also, there was Applicant’s 2009 divorce. In addition, his father opened several 
accounts in Applicant’s name without Applicant’s knowledge, and ran up approximately 
$30,000 in debt. It was also during a period when the national economy was floundering, 
and Applicant survived financially by being self-employed. While some of those factors 
were clearly beyond Applicant’s control, others, such as the expense of commuting, 
school expenses, and child support do not necessarily come within that description. 
Although he was faced with insufficient funds to enable him to maintain his accounts in a 
current status, Applicant took the honorable course and sought protection and assistance 
                                                          
43 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, 
the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a 
way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

under the protection plan offered by Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Under the 
direction of the Bankruptcy Trustee, Applicant made $10,180 in payments to the Trustee, 
and $8,344.58 of that amount was paid towards Applicant’s child-support obligations. 
Wage withholdings were made to further reduce Applicant’s child-support obligations. 
Additional wage withholdings are currently being made to apply to his delinquent student 
loans. Applicant resolved other non-SOR accounts as well as some SOR-related 
accounts. With steady employment, Applicant anticipates being able to increase his 
payments to more rapidly resolve his delinquent accounts.  
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time.  
While there is no evidence that Applicant received financial counseling, his 2017 
credit reports reflect no other delinquent accounts. Applicant has made significant 
progress in stabilizing his finances and avoiding other financial delinquencies. With a 
current monthly remainder of $826 that might be available for discretionary spending or 
savings, Applicant’s finances appear to be under better control. When confronted with the 
issues that caused his financial problems, and faced with insufficient funds to immediately 
remedy the situation, Applicant acted responsibly by dealing with his creditors or 
collection agents.44 Applicant’s actions under the circumstances no longer cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.45 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
                                                          
44 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing 
with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 
4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to 
negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.46   
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant’s student 
loans went into default, his child support developed a significant arrearage, and several 
accounts became delinquent. A judgment was filed against him. He filed for bankruptcy in 
2011. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. A 
variety of factors including the inconsistent pattern of his jobs, taking college courses, the 
expense of commuting long distances to work, a divorce, and child support, all contributed 
to his financial problems. In addition, his father opened several accounts in Applicant’s 
name without Applicant’s knowledge, and ran up approximately $30,000 in debt. It was 
also during a period when the national economy was floundering, and Applicant survived 
financially by being self-employed. Applicant sought protection and assistance under the 
protection plan offered by Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Applicant made 
$10,180 in payments to the Trustee, and $8,344.58 of that amount was paid towards 
Applicant’s child-support obligations. Wage withholdings were made to further reduce 
Applicant’s child-support obligations. Additional wage withholdings are currently being 
made to apply to his delinquent student loans. Applicant resolved various non-SOR 
accounts as well as some SOR-related accounts. With steady employment, Applicant 
anticipates being able to increase his payments to more rapidly resolve his delinquent 
accounts.  
During his service in Iraq, Applicant came under hostile fire. That circumstance 
increases the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by 
a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or exploit him.47 While there 
is a current garnishment of his wages to apply towards his delinquent student loans, 
Applicant has a monthly remainder available for discretionary spending or savings, and 
his financial situation is now under better control.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:48 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated a positive track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. With the assistance of Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, as 
well as a wage withholding, Applicant substantially reduced his child-support arrearage. 
A current garnishment is reducing his delinquent student-loan balance. The three 
accounts over which Applicant had no initial responsibility – those opened by his father 
without his knowledge – will be addressed as the other debts are reduced. There are no 
other more recent delinquent accounts. He has a substantial monthly remainder, and his 
financial situation is under better control. This decision should serve as a warning that 
Applicant’s failure to continue his resolution efforts with respect to his unresolved debts, 
or the actual accrual of new delinquent debts, may adversely affect his future eligibility for 
a security clearance.49 
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. 
See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
                                                          
48 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). 
 
49 While this decision should serve as a warning to Applicant as security officials may continue to monitor his 
finances, this decision, including the warning, should not necessarily be interpreted as a conditional eligibility to hold a 
security clearance under SEAD 4, App. C. Failure to comply with payment plans or other delinquent debt may raise a 
security concern. The Government has the option of following-up with more questions about Applicant’s finances. The 
Government can re-validate Applicant’s financial status at any time through credit reports, investigation, and 
interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the Government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. 
The Government has the right to reconsider the security significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more 
recent conduct having negative security significance.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.n:  For Applicant 
    
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
