Decision 
______________ 
 
 
Lokey Anderson, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: 
 
On February 13, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (e-
QIP). (Government Exhibit 2.)  On March 1, 2017, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. (Item 1.) The action was taken 
under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and 
the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information, effective within the DoD after September 1, 2006.  
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on April 28, 2017.  He requested that his case be 
decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. (Item 1.)  On 
May 12, 2017, Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written case. A 
complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 6 Items, was mailed 
to Applicant on May 12, 2017, and received by him on May 22, 2017.  The FORM 
notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in 
 
2 
 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM.  
Applicant failed to respond to the FORM.  Applicant did not object to Items 1 through 6, 
and they were admitted into evidence.   
 
The SOR in this case was issued under the adjudicative guidelines that came 
into effect within the DoD on September 1, 2006. Security Executive Agent Directive 
(SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, implements new adjudicative 
guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. All national security eligibility decisions issued on or 
after June 8, 2017, are to be decided using the new National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to 
Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), as implemented by SEAD 4. I considered the previous 
adjudicative guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AG, effective 
June 8, 2017, in adjudicating Applicant’s national security eligibility. My decision would 
be the same under either set of guidelines, although this decision is issued pursuant to 
the new AG. 
 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 59 years old. He is married and has one adult child and one adult 
stepchild.  He is employed by a defense contractor.  He is seeking to retain a security 
clearance in connection with his employment.    
 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations 
 
 The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he 
made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR 
identified six delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,000.  Applicant denies 
allegations 1.a., 1d., and 1.e.  He admits allegations 1.b., and 1.f., and partially admits 
and partially denies allegation1.c.   The debts include a judgment for child support in the 
amount of approximately $14,000; delinquent rent in the amount of approximately 
$7,000; and a delinquent consumer debt totaling approximately $2,300.         
 
 Applicant states that his financial problems arose after the September 11, 2000, 
attacks when he and his wife were laid off from their jobs.  Employment opportunities in 
the location then became non-existent, due to aircraft manufacturers drastic downsizing.  
It appears that Applicant has continued to have employment difficulties and has 
accumulated delinquent debt that he has not paid.  Credit reports of Applicant, dated 
February 28, 2015; December 6, 2016; and January 6, 2017, confirm the indebtedness 
listed in the SOR.  (Applicant’s Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.)  Applicant has accepted an offer to 
work for a defense contractor and needs access to classified information.

The following debts became owing and remain outstanding:  
 
1.a.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of 
$969.  Applicant states that the debt was removed from his record because another 
party took responsibility for the debt.  Applicant has provided no documentary evidence 
to support his averment.  The account remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 
6.)  
 
1.b.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of 
$727.  Applicant admits the debt and claims that he will take care of it within then the 
next month or two, when he and his wife are able to move out of the motel that they are 
living in.  The account remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.)       
 
 1.c.     A judgment for child support was entered against the Applicant in 2010 in 
the approximate amount of $14,247.  Applicant contends that the judgment can no 
longer be collected upon due to its age.  The judgment remains owing.  (Government 
Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.)    
 
1.d.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection the approximate amount of 
$403.  Applicant states that he has no knowledge of the debt.  The account remains 
owing.   (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.)  
 
1.e.  A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of 
$357.  Applicant states that the account was closed by the creditor.  He has provided no 
documentary evidence to support his averment.  The account remains owing.  
(Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.)     
 
1.f.  A delinquent account for rent in the amount of approximately $7,200 remains 
owing.  Applicant states that he and his wife plan to resolve the debt once they start 
working full time.  The debt remains owing.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.)   
 
 There is no documentation in the record to show that Applicant has made any 
financial arrangements to pay any of his delinquent debt.  He simply denies the debts 
based on lack of knowledge or because they were charged off.  Each of the debts listed 
in the SOR are reflected in Applicant’s credit reports and continue to remain delinquent 
and owing.   (Government Exhibits 4, 5, and 6.)  
 
Guideline E – Personal Conduct 
 
 Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing 
(e-OIP) dated February 13, 2015.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  In response to Section 26 
concerning his financial record, Applicant was asked if “in the past seven years, has he 
been delinquent on alimony or child support payments?”  He was also asked, “in the 
past seven years if he had a judgment entered against him?”  The Applicant answered 
“NO” to both questions.  These were false responses.  Applicant failed to disclose the 
fact that he had been and currently is, delinquent with child support payments and that a 
 
4 
 
judgment was entered against him in 2010 for child support payments that he has not 
yet paid.         
 
 Applicant stated that he did not know how to answer the question about the 
judgment.  A garnishment action was taken against him in 2008.  After that, there has 
been no attempt to collect the debt by the creditor, thus Applicant does not believe that 
he was obligated to reveal it on his application or that the judgment will be pursued.  
Applicant was aware of the judgment against him for child support, and so he did not 
answer the questions on the application in 2015, truthfully.  It seems that he has simply 
continued to ignore the judgment in hopes that it will fall off of his credit report.  
 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to 
classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this 
decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based 
on the evidence contained in the record.  
 
Directive ¶ E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that 
establishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the 
“applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, 
and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance 
decision.”  
 
 A person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
 
5 
 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information). 
   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
  Applicant remains excessively indebted to the creditors listed in the SOR.  He 
has failed to prove that he has done anything to resolve his delinquent debts.  The 
evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
 AG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered 
all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 including: 
 
6 
 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. 
 
Applicant’s logic concerning the judgment entered against him is flawed.  Despite 
a debts age, the inquiry is not whether it was repaid, but whether Applicant acted 
reasonably and responsibly with respect to the debt.  By ignoring it, he did not.  In 
regard to his other creditors, he states that he is planning to resolve them debts when 
he is financially stable.  At this point, however, it appears that he is unable or unwilling 
to pay these debts.  In this case, Applicant cannot be said to have used good judgment 
or acted responsible, or acted in good-faith.  He has provided no documentary evidence 
to substantiate his averments or to demonstrate that he has done anything to resolve 
his debt.  He has also failed to establish any meaningful track record of repayment. 
Accordingly, it is found that of the debts listed in the SOR remain owing.  Moreover, 
Applicant has not demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely.  In fact, there 
are no indications that his financial problems are being addressed in any fashion or are 
under control.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
The security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
 From the evidence provided, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the 
judgment entered against him in 2010, claiming that because it was not being pursued 
by the creditor, and it was more than seven years old, it could not be collected.  
Applicant has provided no evidence to show that he does not owe the judgment.  
Applicant has not paid the debt and it remains owing on his credit reports.  The fact that 
he did not list the debt in response to questions on his security clearance application 
 
7 
 
indicates behavior that shows questionable judgment, unreliability, and 
untrustworthiness.   
  
AG ¶ 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following 
are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of 
authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual 
specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, 
or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. 
 
 After considering the mitigating conditions outlined above in AG ¶ 17, none of 
them were established in this case.  Applicant intentionally and deliberately attempted to 
conceal material information from the Government regarding the judgment that was 
entered against him.  Falsifying material information is a serious offense, and Applicant 
has done nothing to show that similar lapses in judgment are unlikely to recur. He has 
not provided sufficient evidence to meet his burden of proof with respect to his personal 
conduct. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
 
8 
 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant has failed to 
provide any documentation to show proof of payment toward his delinquent debts.  He 
also deliberately falsified his security clearance application concerning his finances.   
Applicant’s credibility is in question.  He has not been candid and up front with the 
Government about his financial affairs.  He obviously does not understand the need to 
ensure that only individuals with whom the Government can trust can be provided 
access to classified information.  Applicant has not demonstrated that he meets these 
qualifications.          
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I 
conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations and Personal 
Conduct security concerns.  
 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant 
 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:    Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
