GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 14, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On June 22, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified 
(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to 
Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and other 
determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1 The SOR alleged 
                                                          
 
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for

security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons 
why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended 
referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, 
continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. On August 5, 2016, he responded to the SOR and elected to have his case decided 
on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On October 10, 2016 (by telephone message) 
and on October 14, 2016 (by letter), Applicant changed his mind and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. It is unclear when Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed. The case was assigned to me on March 22, 2017.  
A Notice of Hearing was issued on May 4, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
June 23, 2017. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5, and Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE LL were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
and four witnesses testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 6, 2017. I kept the 
record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity 
and timely submitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as AE MM 
through AE OO, without objection. The record closed on August 4, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with comments, all of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.) in the SOR. 
Applicant’s comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and 
thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I 
make the following additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a 
product support specialist engineer with the company or its predecessors for nearly 32 
years. He is a 1979 high school graduate, with a 1985 bachelor of science degree in 
mechanical engineering, and a 1992 certification in environmental engineering. He has 
never served in the U.S. military. Applicant was initially granted a secret security 
clearance in 1985, and it was renewed in 2003. He was married in 1985, and divorced in 
1991. He remarried in 1992, and divorced in 2000. He married again in 2006. He has two 
foster sons, born in 1995 and 1998.  
 
  
                                                          
access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were established to supersede all previously 
issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. Accordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on 
September 1, 2006, under which this security clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the 
two versions, there is no substantial difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.

Financial Considerations2 
Applicant was a real estate investor. A review of his 2004 and 2016 credit reports 
reveals that as far back as 1995 he started acquiring real estate by financing his 
purchases with mortgages and second mortgages. In approximately 2005, after attending 
a real estate seminar, he started a limited liability partnership (LLP) as a vehicle to 
purchase real estate for either resale or a lease option to purchase. While he was a 
partner with mostly family members or close family friends, he was not an employee of 
the LLP. He, alone, was responsible for all LLP debts. There were six properties 
associated with the LLP until 2008-2009, when there were nine properties. The LLP was 
dissolved in approximately 2009.  
The national financial crisis of 2006-2008 created difficulties for Applicant. In 2007, 
the real estate market started declining. Lending dried up and buyers under the lease 
option were unable to obtain financing to complete contracted purchases. Because of the 
loss of his income and revenues generated by his real estate investments, he 
characterized the situation as everything imploding, Applicant followed the guidance set 
forth in what he called a nationally syndicated business and lifestyle magazine, as well as 
a bankruptcy attorney, not to file for bankruptcy, but rather to “move and shake” by 
negotiating settlements with the various financial institutions. As a result, his delinquent 
lines of credit and credit cards were settled either with immediate full payments or with 
increased monthly installments within a six month period in about July 2009.3 He 
managed to sell three of his properties, through a short-sale process; four accounts were 
charged off; and four went into foreclosure because proposed short-sales were rejected 
by the mortgage lenders.4 He also received a couple of Internal Revenue (IRS) Form 
1099-C, Cancellation of Debt. Applicant described the result of his inability to resolve the 
status of the remaining properties:5  
As a result of the aforementioned financial market’s decline, the revenue 
and resources to maintain the portfolio decreased to unsustainable levels 
within nine months. . . . A large portion of debt was negotiated and repaid, 
however, in some instances, proposed offers to repay were summarily 
rejected leaving no recourse but to devote available resources to parties 
willing to agree to workable terms.

By early 2015, Applicant’s portfolio consisted of only one remaining property.6 The 
SOR identified two mortgage accounts and a home-equity line of credit associated with 
two properties that had been placed for collection and either charged off or in a 
foreclosure status, as reflected by Applicant’s January 2015 credit report. Those debts 
total approximately $578,628. The current status of those accounts, according to the 
credit reports, other evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and 
Applicant’s comments regarding same, is as follows. 
 (SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a second mortgage on a property purchased in 2005 with an 
unpaid balance of $68,983, of which $26,335 was past due. Applicant unsuccessfully 
attempted a short-sale on the property. The unpaid balance was charged off in 2015.7 
The creditor issued Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C, in the amount of $68,538, and that 
Form and the amount, along with an IRS Form 982, Reduction of Tax Attributes Due to 
Discharge of Indebtedness (and Section 1082 Adjustment), were included in Applicant’s 
federal income tax return for the tax year 2015.8 The account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b. and 1.c.): These are a purchase-money home-equity line of credit 
(second mortgage) and a first mortgage on a property purchased in 2005 (by quitclaim 
deed) for $408,700, as his primary residence, with respective unpaid balances of 
$102,574 (second mortgage that was charged off) and $416,516 (first mortgage in a 
foreclosure status, of which $15,135 was past due).9 At some point, Applicant started 
receiving account statements from an entity other than the mortgage lender – a servicing 
company – but because there was no indication that the entity was associated with the 
mortgage lender, the statements were discarded. It appeared to Applicant that the chain 
of title to the property had been broken. In May 2012, Applicant filed in the state court for 
a Quiet Title on the property.10 Judgment for Quiet Title was entered against the original 
mortgage lender in December 2012 when it failed to appear and defend the action.11 In 
this instance, the original mortgage lender had lost its right to do business in the state in 
2011. Although the property had renters, paying him a monthly rental of $1,500,12 
Applicant stopped making his $2,523 monthly payments on the first mortgage in 
December 2012, and his $623 monthly payments on the second mortgage in June 2013.13 
He did not place any funds in an escrow account.14 Applicant informed the servicing

10 A Quiet Title action is a legal action that seeks to “quiet title” to property where adverse claims are made 
against the property. For example, where a lender wrongfully forecloses on a property and claims the property as their 
own, but the borrower challenges the foreclosure.

company on several occasions that he was not going to pay them, but he received no 
responses. Applicant first learned that the second mortgage had been charged off when 
he was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management 
(OPM) in early 2015.15 He filed disputes with the credit reporting agencies.16 As of the 
date of the hearing, the creditor had not issued Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C.17  
In May 2015, after the state statute of limitations had already expired,18 a number 
of banks and other financial institutions (but not the original mortgage lender) filed suit in 
federal district court against Applicant seeking declaratory judgments to set aside and 
void the Quiet Title Judgment for violating the mandatory requirements of the state’s quiet 
title statutes and for violating the due process rights of one of the plaintiffs as it pertained 
to notice.19 Although the matter is complicated, one of the essential issues distilled to a 
succinct form is whether or not legal or equitable title to property has to be officially filed 
under state law, and whether it can be expunged without notice to such an unregistered 
or unfiled entity. Another essential issue is whether a company can utilize an electronic 
registration system with the intent to circumvent state law by offering an off-the-record 
transfer of interest in mortgage debt and security instruments in order to save clients the 
costs of recording transfers of beneficial interest in security instruments.20 Applicant filed 
a Motion for Summary Judgment in July 2015 in federal district court. In September 2015, 
Applicant’s motion was granted.21  
In November 2016, the plaintiffs filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment in 
federal district court. Based solely on the written record, and without oral argument, the 
federal district court issued a Judgment in which the state court Judgment for Quiet Title 
was declared null and void.22 In June 2017, the federal district court granted the plaintiffs 
$144,620.19 in “reasonable” attorney’s fees. In January 2017, Applicant filed an appeal 
in the federal court of appeals, and appellate briefs were to be filed by July 26, 2017.23 
The time schedule was extended by stipulation until August 25, 2017.24 There is no more 
current information in evidence. In the event that he ultimately loses his litigation, 
Applicant is prepared to withdraw funds from his retirement accounts to resolve the

issues.25 During the period of the on-going litigation, the account is in the process of being 
resolved. 
Applicant’s annual salary in 2016 was $142,000, and his wife’s self-employment 
income was $50,000.26 In August 2017, Applicant prepared a Personal Financial 
Statement to reflect his net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly 
remainder that might be available for discretionary spending or savings. His net monthly 
income from all sources (including his business income) was $13,314.60; his monthly 
expenses (including attorney fees and church tithe totaling $2,635.08) were $9,263.33; 
and debt payments to various creditors were $3,786.21; leaving $264.56 available for 
discretionary spending or savings.27 Applicant estimated that he has approximately 
$400,000 in retirement assets, aside from his $6,000 401(k) account.28 Other than the 
delinquent debts listed in the SOR, Applicant has no other delinquent accounts.29  
Character References and Work Performance 
 Applicant’s Director of Maintainability and Product Support supervises about 50 
employees, including Applicant. He characterized Applicant as very reliable, technically 
sound, and dedicated.30 The Senior Manager of Systems Engineering was in the 
supervisory chain from 2000 to 2013, while Applicant worked at another location. He 
referred to Applicant as one of the company’s top engineers whose work was outstanding. 
The customers respected Applicant’s technical knowledge and his discipline, and they 
assigned employees to be mentored by Applicant. He has absolutely no concerns about 
Applicant having access to classified information.31 Applicant’s former pastor, now retired, 
at a church with up to 1,000 parishioners, has known Applicant as a deacon of the church. 
Applicant had an excellent reputation among the parishioners.32  
The performance review systems with Applicant’s employer have changed over 
the years, but they generally reflect an individual who either successfully achieves 
expectations or exceeds expectations (under the most recent system), or are at target or 
above target, or even an expert (under earlier systems).33 Applicant has received a

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”34 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”35   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”36 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.37

a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v.

A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, “security 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”38  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”39 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage.

9 
                                      
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG 19:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
Applicant was a real estate investor. At one point, his lines of credit and credit 
cards became delinquent, various accounts were charged off, and properties went into 
foreclosure.40 The SOR focused on two mortgage accounts and a home-equity line of 
credit associated with two properties that were placed for collection and either charged 
off or in a foreclosure status, totaling approximately $578,628. Applicant stopped making 
his payments on the first mortgage in December 2012, and on the second mortgage in 
June 2013, although he apparently had the financial ability to do so. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 
and 19(c) have been established.  
    
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 41 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
                                                          
40 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. 
(Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's 
evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated 
successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) 
to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, 
n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The issues associated with 
Applicant’s credit cards, other accounts, and the mortgages not alleged in the SOR will be considered only for the five

41 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s ongoing, 
unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the 
Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-
01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)).

counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;42 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.  
I have concluded that AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) apply. As noted 
above, in 2007, with the real estate market declining, lending dried up, and buyers under 
the lease option were unable to obtain financing to complete contracted purchases. The 
conditions devastating the real estate market – a substantial and unprecedented business 
downturn – were clearly largely beyond Applicant’s control. Applicant lost income and 
revenues generated by his real estate investments. Applicant chose not to file for 
bankruptcy, but rather to negotiate settlements with the various financial institutions. 
Through his good-faith efforts, a large portion of debt was negotiated and repaid, 
however, in some instances, proposed offers to repay were summarily rejected leaving 
no recourse but to devote available resources to parties willing to agree to workable 
terms. His delinquent lines of credit and credit cards were settled either with immediate 
full payments or with increased monthly installments within a six-month period in about 
July 2009. He managed to sell several properties through a short-sale process, but some 
accounts were charged off, and some mortgages went into foreclosure because proposed 
short-sales were rejected by the mortgage lenders. He also received a couple of IRS 
Form 1099-Cs. By early 2015, Applicant’s portfolio consisted of only one remaining 
property, the one alleged in the SOR, the status of which he has disputed. The status of 
that property is unclear as litigation has taken place with the state court agreeing with 
Applicant, and the federal district court essentially reversing the state court. The matter 
is currently on appeal with the federal court of appeals. 
 Applicant received financial guidance from a nationally syndicated business and 
lifestyle magazine, as well as from a bankruptcy attorney, Applicant followed through on 
the guidance to renegotiate his accounts and avoid bankruptcy. One troubling aspect of 
                                                          
42 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors 
or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must present 
evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action 
aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, 
the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a 
way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ 
Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available 
option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” 
mitigating condition].

Applicant’s actions is his acknowledgment that while he was receiving rent on the 
property, he was not making deposits into an escrow account pending a final 
determination regarding the status of the one remaining property. Nevertheless, should 
he lose the litigation, Applicant fully expects to be able to cover all expenses by 
withdrawing funds from his retirement accounts.43 
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time.  
Under the circumstances, Applicant has acted responsibly by addressing his 
delinquent accounts and by initiating meaningful timely efforts to work with his creditors 
or collection agents.44 Applicant’s actions over the lengthy period, under the 
circumstances, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.45 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
                                                          
43 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future 
are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible 
manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 
1999)). 
 
44 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his 
[or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing 
with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 
4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to 
negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.

(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.46   
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. The SOR focused 
on two mortgage accounts and a home-equity line of credit associated with two properties 
that were placed for collection and either charged off or in a foreclosure status, totaling 
approximately $578,628. Applicant stopped making his payments on the first mortgage in 
December 2012, and on the second mortgage in June 2013, although he apparently had 
the financial ability to continue making payments. Also, while he was receiving rent on the 
property, he was not making deposits into an escrow account pending a final 
determination regarding the status of the one remaining property. 
The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant’s financial problems arose from a substantial and unprecedented business 
downturn in 2007 with the national economy collapsed and the real estate market 
declined. Applicant lost income and revenues generated by his real estate investments. 
He chose not to file for bankruptcy, but rather to negotiate settlements with the various 
financial institutions. Through his good-faith efforts, a large portion of debt was negotiated 
and repaid. His delinquent lines of credit and credit cards were settled either with 
immediate full payments or with increased monthly installments within a six month period 
in about July 2009. He managed to sell several properties through a short-sale process, 
but some accounts were charged off, and some mortgages went into foreclosure because 
proposed short-sales were rejected by the mortgage lenders. He also received a couple 
of IRS Form 1099-Cs. By early 2015, Applicant’s portfolio consisted of only one remaining 
property, the one alleged in the SOR. The status of that property is unclear as litigation 
has taken place with the state court agreeing with Applicant, and the federal district court 
reversing the state court. The matter is currently on appeal with the federal court of 
appeals.  
In 2017, Applicant’s net monthly income from all sources (including his business 
income) was $13,314.60. He had $264.56 available each month for discretionary 
spending or savings. Applicant estimated that he has approximately $400,000 in 
retirement assets, aside from his $6,000 401(k) account. Other than the delinquent debts 
listed in the SOR, Applicant has no other delinquent accounts. With the possible exception 
of the one property currently in litigation, Applicant’s finances appear to be good.

The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:47 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an excellent track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, resolving most of his debts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without 
questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. 
For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising 
from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by Directive ¶ E3.1.25, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c:  For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
