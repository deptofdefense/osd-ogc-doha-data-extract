HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided insufficient evidence of resolution of his financial issues. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.      
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On November 16, 2015, Applicant signed his Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Item 5. On July 10, 2017, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A 
the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) applicable in this case, effective June 8, 2017. The SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. Item 1. 
 
On August 16, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he did not 
request a hearing. Item 4. On October 2, 2017, Department Counsel completed the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM). On October 10, 2017, Applicant received the FORM, and 
he did not respond to the FORM. On February 14, 2017, the case was assigned to me.

The case file consists of nine exhibits. Items 1-9. Applicant did not object to any of the 
Government exhibits, and they are admitted into evidence. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he did not admit or deny the SOR allegations. Item 
4. His SOR response provided some extenuating and mitigating information about 
resolution of his SOR debts.   
 
Applicant is a 64-year-old master trades, and the same employer has employed 
him since October 2015.2 He was unemployed from August 2015 to October 2015. He 
worked on an oil rig as a senior electrician from April 1997 to August 2015. He attended 
college from 1973 to 1974, and he did not receive a degree. He served in the U.S. Navy 
from 1977 to 1997, and honorably retired from the Navy. In 1993, he married, and his 
child was born in 1990. His step-children were born in 1960, 1964, and 1966. There is no 
evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal drugs.  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling $52,535 as follows: ¶¶ 1.a 
and 1.b are charged-off debts for $963 and $356; ¶ 1.c is a state tax debt for $5,878 for 
tax year 2014; ¶ 1.d is a federal income tax debt for $24,072 for tax year 2014; and ¶ 1.e 
is a federal income tax debt for $21,266 for tax year 2016.3 In his SOR response, 
Applicant said the ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b debts are paid. He is paying $600 monthly to address 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c and $200 monthly to pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. He plans to work 
with a tax relief company to resolve the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e.

Applicant provided evidence that he consistently paid $600 monthly to address his 
state tax debt from June 2016 to April 2017 through garnishment of his salary. Items 4, 
6. His documentation indicated he paid the IRS: $120 in June 2016; $25 in August 2016; 
$400 in December 2016; $200 in February 2017; and $200 in June 2017. Item 4.

Applicant’s tax debt in 2014 resulted when Applicant withdrew funds from his 
401(k) account in August 2014 after he left his employment and was not re-employed for 
several months. Item 6. He did not reinvest the 401(k) funds or withhold taxes. Item 6. He 
paid a tax relief company $2,500 to help him negotiate with the IRS to resolve his tax 
debt. Item 6. 
 
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are depicted in Applicant’s April 6, 2017 credit 
report as $105 and $75 past due, respectively. Item 7. The balance owed on the two 
debts is shown as $963 and $356. Item 7.  
  
 The FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM 
“in which to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, 
mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any 
additional information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a 
determination based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. FORM at 7. He did 
not respond to the FORM. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
 
4 
                                         
 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
 
5 
                                         
 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” 
In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability 
of mitigating conditions. 
 
 Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
6 
                                         
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;5   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
Applicant’s unemployment in 2014 was outside of his control and adversely 
affected his finances. However, he did not establish that he acted prudently, and how 
these circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances. Applicant did not 
prove he acted responsibly under the circumstances because he did not establish he was 
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

unable to make more substantial payments to address his federal tax debts for tax years 
2014 and 2016. 
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. The 
amounts indicated as overdue for SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b on his most recent credit report 
are not substantial, and Applicant said the debts are paid. He is making $600 monthly 
payments through garnishment of his salary to address his state tax debt.6 
 
Applicant failed to prove that he was unable to make more substantial payments 
to address his federal income tax debt for tax years 2014 and 2016. He paid about $1,000 
from June 2016 to June 2017 to the IRS.  
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
The Appeal Board provided the following principal rationale for reversing the grant 
of a security clearance: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress sooner resolving his federal tax issues. There is insufficient assurance his 
                                            
6 Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because some debt payments were made 
through garnishment of his salary. Payment of a debt “though garnishment rather than a voluntary effort 
diminishes its mitigating force.” Compare ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR 
Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment 
did not bar mitigation of financial considerations concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. 
Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards delinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light 
of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to the 
administrative judge and stating when addressing an Internal Revenue Service garnishment, “On its face, 
satisfaction of a debt through the involuntary establishment of a creditor’s garnishment is not the same as, 
or similar to, a good-faith initiation of repayment by the debtor.”). 
  
 
8 
                                         
 
financial problems are resolved, under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all 
the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security 
concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 64-year-old master trades, and the same employer has employed 
him since October 2015. He was unemployed from August 2015 to October 2015. He 
worked on an oil rig as a senior electrician from April 1997 to August 2015. He has about 
two years of college. He honorably retired from the U.S. Navy after 20 years of active duty 
service. There is no evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of illegal 
drugs.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigation of the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c. 
His unemployment for about three months in 2014 was the initial cause, in part, of his 
financial problems. His unemployment was a circumstance b eyond his control.    
 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial. Applicant’s 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e allege two delinquent federal tax debts totaling $45,338. Applicant’s 
adjusted gross income is substantial, and he did not explain why he is only paying about 
$200 monthly to address his federal income tax debt. He did not explain why he failed to 
withhold sufficient income to pay his federal income taxes for tax year 2016. He provided 
insufficient corroborating or substantiating documentary evidence of payments or other 
mitigating information relating to these two SOR debts. His actions show lack of financial 
responsibility and judgment and raise unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More 
 
9 
                                         
 
documented information about inability to pay debts, financial history, or financial 
progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 
10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the 
whole person. Financial consideration security concerns are not mitigated at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
