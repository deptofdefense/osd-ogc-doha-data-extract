Summary Decision

MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
On May 3, 2017, the Department of Defense sent Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. 
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the administrative (written) 
record. With his Answer, Applicant provided documentation regarding a debt 
consolidation plan (DCP) and the monthly payments he made from April 2014 through 
May 2017 to resolve his debts (as of the SOR, over $10,500 paid into the DCP). 
 
 On August 25, 2017, Department Counsel sent Applicant a file of relevant material 
(FORM). With the FORM, Department Counsel forwarded to Applicant eight exhibits, pre-
marked Items 1 – 8. Applicant submitted a response and submitted a number of 
documents, which were collectively marked Item 9. Item 9 consists of further documentary 
proof of payments and resolution of past debts, as well as updated credit reports that 
reflect favorably on Applicant’s current financial situation (all accounts paid as agreed and 
over 800 credit score). Without objection, Items 1 – 9 are admitted into the record.  
 
 On January 17, 2018, I was assigned the case and subsequently received written 
confirmation that Applicant remains sponsored for a security clearance. After reviewing 
the evidence, I contacted the parties and informed them that, unless an objection was 
raised, I intended to fairly, quickly, and efficiently resolve the case through summary 
disposition. On February 1, 2018, Department Counsel noted that the Government did 
not object to summary disposition in this case. (Exhibit I.) 
 
2 
 Applicant is a 57-year-old married father of two. He and his wife will be celebrating 
their 35th wedding anniversary in March. He and his wife have permanent guardianship 
of their granddaughter and recently went through the legal expense of adopting her. He 
is an information technology specialist and has been employed as a cleared federal 
contractor since at least 2006. He holds a good reputation at his job for his work, technical 
knowledge, reliability, and trustworthiness. 
 
 Applicant experienced financial trouble when he was hit with a number of 
unanticipated legal, medical, and car and house repair bills. He started to rely on credit 
cards to pay his bills but, when he fell behind 30 days on one of his credit cards, the 
interest rate on all them increased. He started accumulating delinquent debt. He and his 
wife then moved in with his mother-in-law to cut down on expenses. He was able to 
address and resolve a number of his debts, including a $9,000 legal bill for his 
granddaughter’s adoption, on his own. In approximately May 2014, he hired a debt 
consolidation firm to help him resolve his remaining credit card debt. In June 2014, 
Applicant self-reported his financial problems and that he was considering resolving his 
outstanding debt through a DCP to his supervisor and security manager. He also reported 
the information on his June 2015 security clearance application and discussed his 
financial issues during his security clearance investigation. He provided documentation 
with his Answer and FORM Response showing that he addressed and resolved his past 
financial problems. His present financial situation does not raise a security concern. The 
mitigating conditions listed at Adjudicative Guidelines ¶¶ 20(a) – 20(d) apply. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about Applicant’s present 
eligibility for a security clearance. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:         For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security to grant Applicant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information. 
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is granted.
