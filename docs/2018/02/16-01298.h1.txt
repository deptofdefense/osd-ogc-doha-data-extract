Decision 
______________ 
 
 
TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated security concerns regarding Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On May 7, 2015, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF-86). On September 30, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, pursuant to 
Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated 
February 20, 1960, as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended; 
and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 
2005. 
 
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations).  The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to find that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for 
 
2 
 
 
Applicant, and it recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge 
for a determination whether his clearance should be granted.  
 
On January 9, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR. On February 1, 2017, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On February 6, 2017, the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals Office (DOHA) assigned Applicant’s case to me. On March 
2, 2017, DOHA issued a hearing notice, setting the hearing for March 16, 2017. 
Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel 
offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received into evidence 
without objection. Applicant testified, but did not call witnesses, and did not offer any 
exhibits.  
 
 I held the record open until April 14, 2017, to afford Applicant the opportunity to 
submit evidence. Applicant timely submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H, 
which were received into evidence without objection. On March 24, 2017, DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information 
or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs) which he made applicable to all 
covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the 
September 1, 2006 AGs and are effective “for all covered individuals” on or after June 
8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under 
the new AGs, as required.1 
   
Findings of Fact 
 
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations and attached 
mitigating documentation. Applicant’s answers are incorporated as findings of fact. 
After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of 
fact.  
 
Background Information 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old electrical planner employed by a defense contractor 
since June 2007. He seeks a secret security clearance to enhance his position within 
the company. (GE 1, Tr. 10-12)  
 
Applicant graduated from high school in 1994. He served in the U.S. Navy from 
January 1995 to April 1998, and received a general discharge under honorable 
conditions. (GE 1, Tr. 12-16) Applicant was married from 1994 to 2000, and that 
marriage ended by divorce. He has six minor children with five different mothers and 
                                                          
1 The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.

pays child support for his three oldest children. As of his hearing, Applicant stated that 
he had a fiancé who lived with him. She is employed full-time as an electrician at a 
shipyard. However, when Applicant submitted his post-hearing documents, he 
included his “spouse’s” income in his monthly budget. (GE 1, GE 2; AE B; Tr. 16-23, 
47-49)  
 
Applicant’s annual salary is $69,020 and he earns $700 to $1,500 a year as a 
part-time instructor. (Tr. 21-22) Applicant is paying $304 a month in child support for 
his oldest child, $359 a month for his second oldest child, and $546 a month for his 
third oldest child, for a total of $1,209 in monthly child support payments. His take-
home pay is $638 a week, four times a month. Applicant has informal support 
arrangements with the mothers of his three youngest children. (Tr. 23-25) Applicant’s 
monthly rent is $1,200. (Tr. 26) Applicant’s post-hearing budget is discussed infra. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR lists nine allegations under this concern: 1.a. – child support 
collection account for $5,019; 1.b – a medical collection account for $328; and 1.c. – a 
September 2014 Federal tax lien for $30,456; and 1.d through 1.i – that he failed to file 
and pay his Federal taxes for 2005 to 2009 and 2012. These allegations are 
established through the Government’s exhibits (GE 1 – 5) 
 
Since November 2012, Applicant has been paying his child support arrearage 
through wage garnishment. As of his hearing, Applicant estimated that he still owed 
approximately $3,000. (SOR answer; Tr. 32-35, 49, 54; SOR ¶ 1.a) DEBT BEING 
RESOLVED.  
 
As of his hearing, Applicant had not determined the identity of the medical 
collection account creditor. However, post-hearing, he had identified this creditor and 
submitted a receipt for $328 documenting payment in full for this account. (GE 3; AE 
C; Tr. 35-37, 59-61; SOR ¶ 1.b) DEBT RESOLVED. 
 
Applicant took out a loan in September 2016 to pay off his $30,456 Federal tax 
lien. He submitted IRS Form 668, Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien, dated 
January 3, 2017, that documents that his tax lien was satisfied. The Release reflected 
tax arrears for the years 2006, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 were satisfied. (SOR 
answer; Tr. 27-29; SOR ¶ 1.c) DEBT RESOLVED. 
 
Applicant has never denied that he failed to file and pay his Federal income 
taxes. (SOR answer; Tr. 40-41) He testified that he “got some bad advice” from a 
coworker. He was trying to find someone “good” to file his taxes and unfortunately, his 
coworker advised him that he did not need to file his taxes “right away.” That advice 
proved to be wrong and costly for Applicant. Applicant did not realize the extent of his 
problems until the IRS contacted him. In 2009, he hired a tax preparer who was an 
“old school friend” to file all of his tax returns for 2005 to 2009. Applicant did not have 
the money to pay all of his back taxes and the IRS filed a tax lien in 2014 for 
 
4 
 
 
arrearages. To prevent future tax withholding problems, Applicant files as single with 
zero dependents. (Tr. 37-40, 45-46, 51-52, 56-59) Applicant asked the Government to 
forgive him for his mistake and noted that he did everything he could to correct his tax 
situation once he became aware of the problem. Having gone through this experience, 
Applicant has a thorough understanding of his tax filing requirements and is committed 
to never falling behind on future tax filing obligations. (Tr. 61)  
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant did not file and pay his 2012 Federal tax return. 
He self-reported 2012 by “mistake” when completing his SF-86. Applicant testified that 
his tax preparer lost his return “when his computer went down.” After “drop[ping] the 
ball,” the tax preparer resubmitted Applicant’s 2012 return and his tax arrearage was 
paid in 2016 along with the other tax arrearages. (Tr. 42-44, 49-51, 54)  
 
Applicant’s Federal taxes are current. Post-hearing, he submitted his IRS tax 
transcript dated April 13, 2017, documenting that his 2016 taxes were filed, and that 
he received a $4,710 refund. No other arrearages for previous tax years were noted 
on the transcript. (AE A; Tr. 44-45) FEDERAL TAXES ARE RESOLVED. 
 
 Department Counsel thoroughly questioned Applicant on the tax issues. 
Applicant never wavered in his responses nor did he give me any indication that he 
was being untruthful. Having had a chance to observe Applicant’s demeanor and 
listen to his testimony, I found him to be credible, albeit mistaken, on the requirement 
to file federal income taxes.  
 
 Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a monthly budget that he has a net monthly 
remainder of $1,114. His budget also factors into account his spouse’s income. His 
budget further reflects that Applicant is living a modest lifestyle and lives within his 
means. (AE B)   
 
Character Evidence 
 
Applicant submitted two work-related reference letters and recent performance 
evaluations. His superiors view him as a valued employee. One of his references 
described him as “always willing to go the extra mile” and that he is “honest and 
reliable.” Both references recommend Applicant for a security clearance. The other 
reference described Applicant’s community involvement as a volunteer basketball 
coach adding that he is not only a coach, but also a mentor to the players. His 
evaluations reflect consistent top-notch performance. (AE D - H) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the 
Executive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security 
emphasizing, “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. 
Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the 
authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine 
 
5 
 
 
whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. 
at 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”  Exec. Or. 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible 
rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”  See Exec. 
Or. 10865 § 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), § 3.1. Thus, nothing in 
this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole 
or in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, 
loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict 
guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a 
clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the 
burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 
531.  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” 
See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The 
guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any 
of the criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 
95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 
 
6 
 
 
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should 
err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
  
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 
2012) (citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine 
the totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The 
Judge must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-
control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national 
secrets as well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The 
Directive presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the 
Guidelines and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;” “(c) a 
history of not meeting financial obligations;” and “(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal . . 
. income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required.” The 
record establishes these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the 
possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Applicant did not timely file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2005 to 
2009 and 2012. A willful failure to timely prepare (means complete and file with the 
IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.2 For 
                                                          
2 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, 
reads:  
 
 
7 
 
 
purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to file timely his 
Federal income tax returns against him as a federal crime, since his actions were not 
alleged under the criminal conduct AG. Based on this and other information in the 
SOR, the record established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 
19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
AG ¶ 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity 
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the 
problem is being resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to 
make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  
make such return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times 
required by law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be 
guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United 
States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); 
O’Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931). 
 
8 
 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Applicant has resolved or is resolving his SOR debts. AG ¶ 20(d) is applicable 
to all of the SOR allegations. The remainder of this analysis will primarily focus on 
Applicant’s failure to timely file his Federal income tax returns from 2005 to 2009 and 
2012, the most significant security concern alleged. Under these facts, application of 
AG ¶ 20(a) initially appears limited because the multiple income tax returns at issue 
were for recent years and his other debts have been ongoing until recently. Now 
apprised of the importance of filing tax returns, even when a refund is expected, 
Applicant is aware of his obligations in that regard. He promised to seek professional 
guidance in the future and to file his Federal tax returns on time, as required. 
Consequently, I find AG ¶ 20(a) applies. Moreover, Applicant is genuinely contrite over 
his laxity and oversight. He has taken the appropriate corrective action. Evidence of 
his Federal tax return filings and payment of tax arrearages was introduced. The 
situation is now under control and AG ¶ 20(g) applies.  
 
 Applicant believed he was not required to file his Federal tax returns for all of 
those tax years. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance 
adjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it 
directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a 
proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. 
Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does 
not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability 
required of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., 
ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & 
Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 
(D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See 
ISCR Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-
05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 
18, 2015). The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has 
purportedly corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] 
is now motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful 
consideration of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding 
prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility,” including a failure to timely file federal 
 
9 
 
 
income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 
2016)  
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 
and received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when the tax returns were filed in ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the 
following principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance, “By failing 
to file his 2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability 
required of persons granted access to classified information.” ISCR Case No. 15-
01031 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
On June 8, 2017, the new AGs went into effect.  In 2009, shortly after learning 
of the requirement to file tax returns, regardless of whether he was owed a refund, 
Applicant “made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file [all required 
federal income tax returns] . . . and is in compliance with those arrangements.” AG ¶ 
20(g). Based on consideration of his credibility, contrition, and new understanding of 
his responsibilities, there is sufficient assurance that his financial problems are 
resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the 
circumstances, financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the 
Applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should 
consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  
     
 
10 
 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration” of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under 
Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 
2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old electrical planner employed by a defense contractor 
since June 2007. He has worked the majority of his adult working life in the defense 
industry, and having a clearance will enhance his ability to contribute further. His 
employer values him as an employee and supports him for a security clearance.  
 
Once Applicant became aware that he was required to file Federal income tax 
returns, regardless of whether he was owed a refund, he took prompt corrective action 
by taking out a loan to pay his tax arrearages. He is current on the filing of all of his 
income tax returns. I agree with Applicant’s admission of negligence. Applicant’s error 
in judgment is less serious because it was not motivated by a desire to withhold funds 
due to the IRS or having a laissez faire attitude. This process had a sobering effect on 
Applicant and I am confident that he will endeavor to timely file and his taxes in the 
future. 
  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, and the 
new AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I 
conclude that financial consideration security concerns are mitigated. It is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance 
eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.i:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is granted.
