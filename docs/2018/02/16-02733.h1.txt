Summary Decision

MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
On October 29, 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under the financial 
considerations guideline. Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. A 
hearing was held on December 14, 2017. Applicant testified and both parties submitted 
exhibits for the record. Applicant timely submitted additional evidence post-hearing.  
 
 On February 12, 2018, after reviewing all the evidence, I informed the parties that 
the case appeared appropriate for summary disposition in Applicant’s favor. Department 
Counsel did not object. (Appellate Exhibit I.) 
 
Findings of Fact and Analysis 
 
 Applicant started experiencing financial trouble in 2009, when the small business 
he had opened a few years earlier failed. He was forced to declare bankruptcy to resolve 
his business-related debt. Before starting the business, Applicant had worked for many 
years as a cleared federal employee and contractor. He opened a business in the 
alternate energy field in State A after his wife’s doctors informed them that her medical 
condition would be helped if they lived in a warmer climate near the ocean.

 Applicant, like many others during the recession, was unable to attain gainful 
employment for many years. He worked low-paying jobs (fast food chain restaurants and 
large retail stores) to pay his bills, including the high premiums for his wife’s medical 
insurance. He also withdrew money from his 401(k) retirement account to pay for 
everyday living expenses. He incurred delinquent debt, including tax-related debt.  
 
 In 2013, Applicant was hired by his current employer. He immediately began to 
address and resolve his delinquent debts. He submitted documentation showing that he 
received financial counseling and hired a certified public accounting firm, which helped 
him file overdue tax returns and establish payment plans to satisfy his tax debts. He either 
paid or is paying his debts. He self-reported the information about his financial issues. 
Recent credit reports reflect that Applicant pays his bills on time. The credit reports also 
reflect a good credit score (over 700).  
 
 Accordingly, the record evidence reflects that Applicant’s past financial problems 
were caused or exacerbated by matters beyond his control. He provided documentation 
showing that he took responsible action to resolve his financial issues and, though he is 
still in the process of regaining his financial footing, his current financial situation does not 
raise a security concern. Additionally, the evidence reflects a favorable security record 
and several work and community references commented favorably about Applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, extensive volunteer work, and overall good character. 
 
 In evaluating the security concern at issue, I considered the applicable 
disqualifying and mitigating conditions, as well as the whole-person concept. Specifically, 
I find that the mitigating conditions found in the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines 
¶¶ 20(a) – 20(d) apply.1  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:         For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national 
security to grant Applicant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information. 
Applicant’s request for a security clearance is granted.
