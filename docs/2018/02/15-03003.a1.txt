APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
November 23, 2015, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for
that decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department
of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On October 31, 2017, after considering the record, Defense Office of
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant’s request
for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant has not raised an issue of harmful error with specificity.  He states that he has
worked hard to address his financial problems and requests that we review the file and reconsider
the Judge’s adverse decision.  Our authority to review cases is limited to those in which the
appealing party has raised an issue of harmful error.  We do not review a case de novo.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 15-08349 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2017).
