MATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant settled several delinquent accounts in 2017 for less than their full 
balances. He made nine months of payments starting in December 2016 to rehabilitate 
federal student loans totaling $18,834. He is not likely to incur new delinquent debt, 
knowing that it could compromise his security clearance eligibility needed for defense- 
contractor employment. Clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
 On June 7, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD 
CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue 
security clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order 
(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on 
September 1, 2006. 
 
2 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on June 27, 2017, and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On 
September 12, 2017, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine 
whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. On October 13, 2017, I scheduled a hearing for November 16, 
2017. In prehearing guidance, Applicant was informed that the Director of National 
Intelligence (DNI) had issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4 establishing the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, to all adjudications for 
national security eligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.1 
 
At the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and nine Applicant exhibits (AEs 
A-I) were admitted in evidence. Applicant and three witnesses testified, as reflected in a 
transcript (Tr.) received on December 1, 2017. I held the record open until January 2, 2018, 
for Applicant to supplement the record. On December 27, 2017, Applicant submitted AE J, 
which showed a pending settlement payment for a defaulted vehicle loan. The document 
was admitted with no objections from the Government. 
 
On January 23, 2018, I reopened the record for one week for Applicant to provide 
proof that the December 2017 loan settlement payment cleared his account and to update 
the record concerning recent student loan payments. On January 26, 2018, Applicant 
submitted AE K showing the car loan payment was processed. On January 29, 2018, he 
submitted AE L reflecting a student loan payment. AEs K and L were admitted into 
evidence with no objections from the Government. 
 
Summary of SOR Allegations 
 
 The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of June 7, 2017, Applicant owed 
$12,482 on a charged-off auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.a); $18,834 in defaulted federal student 
loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d); $3,278 for wireless telephone, cable and satellite television, and 
utility services (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.h, 1.j, and 1.l); a $1,045 judgment for medical services (SOR 
¶ 1.i); and a $181 medical collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.k). When he responded to the SOR, 
Applicant admitted the defaulted car loan; the wireless telephone debts of $1,315 (SOR ¶ 
1.e), $573 (SOR ¶ 1.g), and $362 (SOR ¶ 1.h); the satellite and cable debts of $756 (SOR 
¶ 1.f) and $272 (SOR ¶ 1.j); and the utility debt of $75 (SOR ¶ 1.l). Applicant denied the 
federal student loan delinquencies, explaining that he has been in a repayment program 
since December 2016. He also denied the medical debts because the medical care should 
have been covered by his medical insurance. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following 
findings of fact. 
 
                                                 
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my decision in 
this case. 
3 
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old pipefitter who worked for a defense contractor from 
October 2015 to June 2017. In June 2017, Applicant was laid off from his defense 
contractor employment because of the issuance of the SOR. His recall depends on 
favorable adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. (GEs 1, 4; Tr. 37-38, 61.) 
 
Applicant was married to his ex-wife from 2007 to 2014. He has been in a cohabitant 
relationship since May 2014. Applicant has two sons now ages nine and 11. Applicant’s 
girlfriend has two children ages 10 and 12. All four children live with Applicant and his 
girlfriend. (GE 1; Tr. 53-54.) 
 
Applicant worked as a full-time security guard and bartender for a restaurant from 
May 2005 to October 2007. He was then employed part time as a warehouse associate for 
a retailer until March 2008, when he moved to his present area and found work as a full-
time security guard. In November 2008, his younger son was born with an illness, which 
kept him hospitalized for weeks. Applicant missed too many days from work, and he was 
involuntarily terminated from his employment in January 2009. Applicant held full-time 
employment as a residential counselor from January 2009 to October 2010, when he left 
for a staff job with a resource institute at higher pay and a shorter commute. (GEs 1, 4.) 
 
While in that position, Applicant began attending a local community college in 
January 2013. Between February 2013 and October 2014, Applicant obtained three federal 
student loans for $13,639 (SOR ¶ 1.b), $3,500 (SOR ¶ 1.c), and $3,098 (SOR ¶ 1.d). (GE 
2.) Applicant stopped attending school in December 2014 and did not earn a degree. (GE 
1.) 
 
In March 2014, Applicant left his employment of 3.5 years for a compliance 
specialist position with his girlfriend’s employer. Near the end of his probationary period, 
Applicant was involuntarily terminated in May 2014 for the stated reason that he was not a 
good fit. (GE 1.) Applicant had to drive his personal vehicle to other worksites to train 
employees, and he asked to be compensated for his mileage. Applicant believes he was 
terminated because the company did not want to compensate him for his mileage. (GE 4.) 
 
Applicant was unemployed from May 2014 to May 2015. He collected 
unemployment benefits during that time. Applicant held a part-time job from May 2015 until 
October 2015 when he began his defense-contractor employment at $15.15 an hour. (GE 
4; Tr. 55.) Applicant was not eligible to work overtime during his probationary period of six 
months. (Tr. 55.) 
 
On October 28, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a 
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He did not disclose any financial 
issues on his SF 86. (GE 1.) 
 
As of November 13, 2015, the credit bureaus were reporting that Applicant owed 
$1,045 on a medical judgment from June 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.i); $12,482 on an automobile loan 
charged off in September 2015 for $12,602 (SOR ¶ 1.a); and $1,315, $756, $362, $278, 
$272, $181, and $75 on accounts placed in collection between May 2013 and June 2015 
4 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.f, 1.h, 1.j-1, and an unalleged $278 medical debt).2 Applicant was also 
reportedly past due $673 on his largest student loan (SOR ¶ 1.a). His other student loans 
were rated as current. (GE 2.) In September 2016, a $573 wireless phone debt was placed 
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.g). (GE 3.) 
 
Only one year into his job with the defense contractor, Applicant had already made 
noteworthy contributions. He handled some of the more critical tasks and completed a 
large variety of work that had been “constantly first time quality with a sharp focus on 
safety.” He had gained knowledge and qualifications surpassing that typical of a first-year 
employee. Reliable in problem solving, Applicant displayed great attention to detail with 
stellar results. Because of Applicant’s “stellar performance,” Applicant’s general foreman 
submitted him as a candidate for accelerated advancement to the classification of third 
class mechanic. Retaining Applicant in the department was considered important to the 
department’s future success. (AE I.) Applicant was reclassified from a step 3 learner to a 
mechanic class 3 in February or March 2017. His hourly wage increased from $17 to $21. 
(Tr. 56-57.) 
 
On February 28, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant volunteered that he had some cell 
phone, cable television, medical bills, and student loans that were placed for collection 
because he did not have the income to pay them. Applicant was unable to provide details 
about the debts. When confronted with the adverse information on his credit record, 
Applicant recognized the $1,315 wireless phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.e), and he expressed an 
expectation that he would satisfy it in the next three months. He erroneously believed that 
the $272 collection debt was owed to the telecommunications provider in SOR ¶ 1.g rather 
than the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.j. He acknowledged the charged-off automobile loan (SOR ¶ 
1.a), which he explained was for a 2014 model-year vehicle that he returned to the 
dealership shortly after purchase when he realized he could not afford the payments.3 
Applicant also recognized the student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d), but indicated that he had 
been repaying them at $5 a month for nine months to rehabilitate them. Applicant did not 
recognize some of the collection debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l) or the medical 
judgment debt (SOR ¶ 1.i). He described his overall financial situation as fair but improving 
and explained that he and his girlfriend were expecting a settlement of up to $5 million in 
the future from a vehicular accident. (GE 4.) 
 
As of April 21, 2017, Applicant’s credit report reflected no progress toward repaying 
the charged-off automobile loan, the $1,045 medical judgment, or the collection debts for 
wireless phone, cable television, and satellite television services (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.h). 
                                                 
2 Applicant’s credit reports show dates of last activity of June 2015 for the $1,315 phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.e), July 
2014 for the $756 satellite television debt (SOR ¶ 1.f), November 2011 for the $362 wireless phone debt (SOR 
¶ 1.h), October 2009 for the $272 cable television debt (SOR ¶ 1.j), and September 2016 for the $573 wireless 
phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.g). (GEs 2-3.) 
 
3 Available credit information indicates that Applicant obtained a car loan of $29,777 in May 2013. Last activity 
on the account was variously reported as November 2013 (GE 3) and as April 2014. (GE 2.) As of March 
2017, the loan had a past-due balance of $12,482. (GE 3.) Applicant assumed he would be contacted when 
the returned vehicle was sold. (Tr. 68.) 
5 
 
Applicant’s federal student loans were past due for $11,762, $3,766, and $3,306 (SOR ¶¶ 
1.b-1.d). Applicant was making timely payments of $339 per month on a vehicle loan 
obtained for $14,760 in December 2016. The collection debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1.l were no 
longer on his credit record. (GE 3.) 
 
Applicant volunteered without pay as a part-time basketball coach for his city’s 
recreational department from late November 2016 to March 2017 and for another league 
from March 2017 to June or July 2017. That team traveled every weekend, and Applicant 
had expenses for gasoline and food. (Tr. 57-58.) After he was laid off unexpectedly in June 
2017 from his defense-contractor employment, Applicant applied for unemployment 
compensation. It took a month for his benefit to be approved. To pay his household bills, 
Applicant withdrew his entire 401(k), which was only $1,900 after taxes. (Tr. 59, 61-62.) In 
August 2017, Applicant was hired as a part-time private contractor at $40 an hour two to 
three nights a week training pipefitters for the defense contractor. (Tr. 60, 62-63.) When a 
new class started in September 2017, his hours increased to 30 per week. He worked for 
six weeks until the class ended. (Tr. 63-64.) 
 
 As of November 2017, Applicant was collecting unemployment compensation at 
$450 per week. In early November 2017, Applicant paid $420 in full settlement of the debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.f. (AE D.) He also settled the $1,315 phone debt for $756 (SOR ¶ 1.e) and the 
$362 phone debt for $290 (SOR ¶ 1.h). (AEs A, C; Tr. 75-76.) He had no success in 
determining the entity that currently holds the $573 wireless telephone debt (SOR ¶ 1.g). 
The collection entity identified in the SOR advised him the debt had been transferred to 
another assignee while the original creditor indicated that the collection entity still held the 
debt. (Tr. 77.) He contacted the cable provider about the $272 debt (SOR ¶ 1.1.j), which 
was for cable boxes that he did not return. Applicant was advised that since the equipment 
was over two years old, the company would not take them back. Applicant did not have the 
extra funds to pay the debt. (Tr. 82.) In mid-November 2017, he satisfied the utility debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.l. (AE G; Tr. 81.) He was living from paycheck to paycheck but knew with his 
security clearance pending that he had to make some effort to address his delinquencies. 
(Tr. 64-65, 70.) 
 
 In late December 2017, the collection entity for the $12,482 charged-off auto loan 
agreed to accept $5,500 in full settlement on receipt of an initial payment of $2,000 due 
immediately and $700 per month from January 2018 to May 2018. Applicant paid the 
$2,000. (AEs J, K.) Applicant plans to continue to take care of his debts because he wants 
to purchase a home. (Tr. 66.) 
 
 Applicant made hardship payments of $5 a month for nine consecutive months from 
December 2016 to remove his federal student loans from default. He presented 
documentation showing recent payments of $10 in October 2017 and $5 in November 
2017 to his current loan servicer. (AE E; Tr. 71-72.) Applicant testified that his monthly 
payments were to increase to a “manageable” $152 in December 2017. (Tr. 74.) In late 
January 2018, Applicant made a monthly payment of approximately $220. (AE L.) 
6 
 
 Applicant has made no payments toward the $1,045 medical judgment (SOR ¶ 1.i) 
or the $181 medical collection debt. He focused on resolving those debts that are 
considered discretionary in that he did not have to incur them. (Tr. 79-80.) 
 
 Applicant’s girlfriend is employed at $13 an hour. She owes some student loans 
from her studies at a community college toward an associate degree, but her loans are 
deferred. (Tr. 86.) Applicant and his girlfriend maintain separate bank accounts. They 
share the bills, although Applicant paid the majority of the household bills during the six 
weeks in September and October 2016 because she paid most of the bills when he was 
unemployed. (Tr. 84.) His girlfriend covered their rent of $1,300 per month in November 
2017. Their other monthly expenses include car payments (his at $340 and hers almost 
$300); cable television at $235; electricity at $200; propane at $300 when the tank gets 
filled; and $280 for four cell phones. (Tr. 85-88.) If Applicant is recalled to work for the 
defense contractor, his girlfriend plans to resign from her job and attend nursing school. 
(Tr. 94.) 
 
 Applicant’s girlfriend anticipates receipt of $2.75 million in settlement funds from a 
motor vehicle accident in which her two children lost their father. Applicant’s girlfriend was 
scheduled to receive a lump sum of $60,000 and back child support covering the three 
years since the accident, followed by “$2,000 a week or something like that” going forward 
to care for her two children. (Tr. 90-91.) The settlement is being contested by her children’s 
father’s girlfriend, who survived the crash but wanted approximately $2 million to $4 million 
in addition to the $13 million she had already received in settlement. (Tr. 92-95.) 
 
Work References 
 
 Applicant’s general foreman during Applicant’s defense-contractor employment 
confirms that Applicant received the higher classification and “continued to demonstrate 
and pursue what [they] hoped was a long-term career with [the defense contractor].” (Tr. 
36-37.) This general foreman “absolutely” considers Applicant to be an asset to the 
company. Applicant exceeded the foreman’s expectations. (Tr. 34.) From work 
performance and character perspectives, Applicant was someone key to the department’s 
day-to-day operations. (Tr. 39.) The loss of Applicant’s contributions since July 2017 have 
hindered the department’s productivity and ability to do the job. (Tr. 40.) 
 
 An operations manager, who has 380 employees reporting to him, testified about 
Applicant’s job tasks being very critical. Applicant was one of a very limited number of 
employees qualified to perform his specific duties. Applicant was usually available to work 
weekends when needed. (Tr. 44-45.) The operations manager indicated that Applicant 
would be recalled to his position “tomorrow” if his security clearance is adjudicated 
favorably. (Tr. 46.) Applicant’s union representative also recommends Applicant for security 
clearance eligibility. (Tr. 50.) Applicant did not share the government’s concerns about his 
security clearance eligibility with his union representative (Tr. 51), the operations manager 
(Tr. 45-46), or the general foreman. (Tr. 39.)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive 
Branch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing 
that “no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 
U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, 
the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in 
evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines 
are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative 
process. The administrative judge’s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative 
judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, 
favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence 
to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
is responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .” The applicant 
has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 
provides that decisions shall be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 
3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or 
sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated 
by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security 
concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance 
misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by 
known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result 
from criminal activity, including espionage. 
 
 An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances 
in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is 
broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified 
information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual’s self-
control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information.  
 
 Guideline F security concerns are established by Applicant’s record of financial 
delinquency. He returned a vehicle to a dealership when he could not afford the payments. 
In September 2015, a $12,602 balance was charged off, and, as of June 2017, he owed a 
deficiency balance of $12,482 on the loan. In In 2015, he defaulted on federal student 
loans totaling approximately $18,834. Five accounts for phone, electric utility, and cable 
and satellite television services totaling $3,353 were placed for collection between May 
2013 and September 2016. In June 2013, a medical provider obtained a $1,045 judgment 
against Applicant. In November 2013, a $181 medical debt was placed for collection. None 
of these debts had been resolved as of June 2017, although Applicant was making small 
hardship payments of $5 monthly toward rehabilitating his student loans. Disqualifying 
conditions AG ¶ 19(a), “inability to satisfy debts,” and AG ¶ 19(c), “a history of not meeting 
financial obligations,” apply. 
 
 A record of financial delinquency may be mitigated under one or more of the 
following conditions under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
9 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a 
legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, 
and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
 Some of Applicant’s delinquent debts were incurred more than five years ago, such 
as the cable television debt (SOR ¶ 1.j) and the $362 wireless phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.h). 
Last activity on the car loan (SOR ¶ 1.a) was more recent, however. He defaulted on his 
student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d) and on the $573 cell phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.g) in 2015, 
which makes it difficult to conclude that the debts were incurred so long ago to no longer 
cast doubt on Applicant’s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. AG ¶ 20(a) is not 
established. 
 
AG ¶ 20(b) is applicable because Applicant experienced low income and 
unemployment, which led to his financial struggles beginning in 2014. After losing his 
employment in May 2014 for not being a good fit, Applicant was unemployed for a year. 
Applicant then held only a part-time position from May 2015 until October 2015 when he 
started working for the defense contractor at $15.15 an hour. His cohabitant girlfriend had 
steady employment at $13 an hour, but she was receiving no child support for her two 
children following the untimely death of her children’s father. In February or March 2017, 
Applicant received a significant pay increase to $21 an hour on his reclassification for 
reasons of stellar work performance. However, he was laid off unexpectedly by the defense 
contractor in June 2017 after the issuance of the SOR, and it took one month for him to 
receive unemployment compensation. In August 2017, Applicant was hired as a part-time 
private contractor at $40 an hour two to three nights a week. When a new class started in 
September 2017, his hours increased to 30 per week for the next six weeks until he again 
found himself without a job. 
 
  AG ¶ 20(b) requires that an individual act responsibly under the circumstances, and 
Applicant is credited with making payments to rehabilitate his federal student loans starting 
in December 2016. He took steps to address some of his other delinquencies in November 
2017 while on unemployment compensation. With a tight budget, he focused on paying 
10 
 
those obligations that he considered discretionary in that he did not have to incur them. 
Applicant’s disregard of a court judgment to pay a debt raises some concerns about his 
judgment, but he is making progress toward resolving his debts. 
 
 AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are established because Applicant has fully settled for less 
than their full balances those debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h. He paid in full the $75 debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.l. He rehabilitated his federal student loans through nine months of small 
payments, and he has made the payments since then to keep his loans current. At his 
security clearance hearing, Applicant expressed an intention to continue to address his 
debts provided he has the income to do so. He showed his commitment in that regard by 
reaching a settlement of the defaulted automobile loan in late December 2017, which 
requires him to pay $5,500 in a lump sum of $2,000 followed by six monthly payments of 
$700. He provided proof that he made the $2,000 payment. 
 
 Applicant has not made any payments toward the cable debt (SOR ¶ 1.j), the $573 
wireless phone debt (SOR ¶ 1.g), the medical judgment (SOR ¶ 1.i), or the medical 
collection debt (SOR ¶ 1.k). He offered to return the cable television equipment, but the 
creditor refused to accept it because of its age. He had no success locating the entity 
currently holding the wireless phone debt. There is no evidence of any actions on his part 
to address the medical debts. Without some proof that the medical debts should have been 
covered by his medical insurer, AG ¶ 20(e) is not satisfied as to his delinquent medical 
debts. Applicant does not dispute his legal liability for the wireless telephone debt. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
In the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of 
an applicant’s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative 
process factors in AG ¶ 2(d).4 Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were addressed under 
Guideline F, but some warrant additional comment. 
  
 The security clearance adjudication is not aimed at collecting an applicant’s 
personal debts. Rather, it involves an evaluation of an applicant’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). In evaluating Guideline F cases under the whole-person 
concept, the Appeal Board has established that an applicant is not required to pay off 
every debt in the SOR: 
 
                                                 
4 The factors under AG ¶ 2(d) are as follows: 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the 
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other 
permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for 
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.

The Board has previously noted that the concept of a meaningful track 
record necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through 
payment of debts. However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, 
to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All 
that is required is that an applicant demonstrate that he has established a 
plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to 
implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an 
applicant’s financial situation and evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. 
 
See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and 
quotation marks omitted). Applicant’s payments to satisfy or settle four debts in the SOR 
are viewed favorably, despite the recency of their resolution. After paying $235 since 
October 2017 toward his student loans, he still owes more than $18,000, but his student 
loans are now current. Applicant has yet to make $700 monthly payments from January 
2018 through May 2018 to fully settle the charged-off car loan. He has made no payments 
toward the delinquencies in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.i-1.k totaling $2,071. 
 
 In the whole-person evaluation, Applicant demonstrated his commitment to his job 
when he was employed by the defense contractor. His position was reclassified to bring his 
pay commensurate with the quality of his work. Applicant’s managers from his defense-
contractor employment want Applicant recalled to work if his security clearance is 
adjudicated favorably. His value to the company is evident in him being given a contract 
position to train pipefitters. 
 
 Applicant’s financial issues were largely caused by a lack of income rather than by a 
disregard of his legitimate obligations. There is no evidence of any overreliance on 
consumer credit, frivolous spending, or other financially irresponsible behavior that could 
compromise his financial situation in the future. Provided he has the income to make 
payments, I am persuaded that Applicant will continue to address his delinquencies. He is 
not seen as likely to jeopardize classified information to obtain funds to pay debts. After 
considering all the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.l:  For Applicant 
12 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is granted.
