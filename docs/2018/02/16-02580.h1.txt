GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations and 
personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information 
is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 27, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On October 18, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1 The SOR 
                                                          
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, 
National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for 
 
2 
                                      
 
alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E 
(Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. On November 10, 2016, he responded to the SOR and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government’s 
file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on July 10, 2017, and he was afforded an opportunity, 
within a period of 30 days after receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material 
in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished 
a copy of the Directive. Applicant received the FORM on July 20, 2017. An exchange of 
correspondence between Department Counsel and Applicant took place on several 
occasions, and Applicant timely submitted his initial Response to the FORM on August 
21, 2017 (Initial Response), a second Response to the FORM on August 31, 2017 (2nd 
Response), and a third Response to the FORM on September 20, 2017 (3rd Response). 
Applicant’s final response was due on September 27, 2017. The case was assigned to 
me on January 19, 2018. 
  
Rulings on Procedure 
 
Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain 
enumerated facts associated with the filing requirements of Federal income tax returns. 
Specifically, those filing requirements are: 
 
o Generally, the same rules for filing Federal income tax returns apply to 
U.S. citizens or resident aliens, whether they are in the United States or 
abroad (citing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Pub. 54, Tax Guide for 
U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens Abroad 2016 (December 8, 2016), at 
3. U.S. citizens living abroad are taxed on their worldwide income (citing 
IRS Pub. 54, at 12); 
 
o For tax year 2013, an individual who was married filing separately was 
required to file an income tax return with the IRS if his gross income was 
at least $3,900. An Individual Income Tax Return (Form 1040) was to be 
filed by April 15, 2014 for tax year 2013 (citing IRS 1040 Instructions 
2013 (December 24, 2013), at 6-7); 
 
o For tax year 2014, an individual who was married filing separately was 
required to file an income tax return with the IRS if his gross income was 
                                                          
access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were established to supersede all previously 
issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. Accordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on 
September 1, 2006, under which this security clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the 
two versions, there is no substantial difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.

at least $3,950. A Form 1040 was to be filed by April 15, 2015 for tax 
year 2014 (citing IRS 1040 Instructions 2014 (January 26, 2015), at 6-
7);  
 
o For tax year 2015, an individual who was single and under the age of 65 
was required to file an income tax return with the IRS if his gross income 
was at least $10,300. A Form 1040 was to be filed by April 18, 2016 for 
tax year 2015 (citing IRS 1040 Instructions 2015 (January 5, 2016), at 
7-8); 
 
o Individuals meeting certain requirements may qualify for the foreign 
earned income and foreign housing exclusions and foreign housing 
deduction (citing IRS Pub. 54, at 12). The foreign earned income 
exclusion is voluntary, and can be chosen by filing Form 2555, Foreign 
Earned Income, or Form 2555-EZ, Foreign Earned Income Exclusion 
(citing IRS Pub. 54, at 20). One of these forms must be filed each year 
the individual claims the foreign earned income exclusion (citing IRS 
Pub. 54, at 23); 
 
o For individuals filing on a calendar year basis, the due date for filing 
income tax returns is April 15 of the following year (citing IRS Pub. 54, 
at 3). Individuals are allowed an automatic two-month extension to file 
their return and pay federal income taxes if they are a U.S. citizen or 
resident alien, and on the regular due date of the return, they: (1) are 
living outside the United States and Puerto Rico and their main place of 
business or post of duty is outside the United States and Puerto Rico, or 
(2) are in the military or naval service on duty outside the United States 
and Puerto Rico (citing IRS Pub. 54, at 4). If they are not able to file the 
return by the automatic two-month extension period, they can generally 
get an additional four months to file a return, for a total of six months, 
but the request for the additional four months must be made by the due 
date allowed by the two-month extension (citing IRS Pub. 54, at 4). In 
addition to the six-month extension, taxpayers who are out of the country 
can request a discretionary two-month additional extension of time to file 
their returns (to December 15 for calendar year taxpayers), but calendar 
year taxpayers must send a letter to the IRS explaining the reason why 
they need the additional time by October 15th (citing IRS Pub. 54, at 4); 
and 
 
o An electronically filed return is not considered filed until the IRS 
acknowledges acceptance of the electronic portion of the tax return for 
processing (citing IRS Pub. 1345, Handbook for Authorized IRS e-file 
Providers of Individual Income (undated).

After weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the 
relevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule 201, 
Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts,2 as set forth 
above.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with comments, both of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations (¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b.), as well as the sole 
allegation pertaining to personal conduct (¶ 2.a.), in the SOR. However, in his Initial 
Response to the FORM, he changed his position related to both allegations pertaining to 
financial considerations, and he now admits them. There has been no change in his 
position related to personal conduct allegation. Applicant’s admissions and comments are 
incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the 
evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following 
additional findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been a live 
fire training technician with the company, serving overseas since August 2001. He is a 
1979 high school graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in June 1981, and he served on 
active duty until he was honorably retired in July 2001. He was granted a secret security 
clearance in 1981, and maintained that clearance through subsequent reinvestigations. 
Applicant was married in 1990, and divorced in 1992. He remarried in 1993, and was 
divorced in 2015. He has been cohabiting with a foreign national since 2012. Applicant 
has two daughters, born in 1994 and 2010.  
 
Financial Considerations 
Applicant has been working and residing overseas since August 2001. During an 
interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on 
March 31, 2016, Applicant acknowledged that for the past several years, with emphasis 
on the tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015, he failed to timely file his federal income tax 
returns. He explained that his failures were unintentional because he “he does not view 
filing U.S. tax returns as a priority because he never owes any taxes. He noted that the 
IRS gives him up to two years to file  a Form 2555 to prove that his tax home is overseas, 
                                                          
2 Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See 
McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 
n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 
at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); ISCR Case No. 11-01994 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 25, 2012). The most common basis for 
administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from government reports. See 
Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative 
notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. 
Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous documents). See ISCR Case No. 
99-0452 at 8 n. 7 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2000) (“In light of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, 
Pub. L. 104-231, 110 Stat. 3048 (amending 5 U.S.C. 552) and the wide-spread availability of Internet access to the 
public, The Board concludes that official or administrative notice may be taken, in appropriate cases, of official 
documents posted by federal departments or agencies on their Web sites.”) In this instance, although Department 
Counsel has selected only certain pages of facts appearing in the identified publications, I have not limited myself to 
only those facts, but have considered the publications in their entirety.

which qualifies him for the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion. He planned to file his 
federal income tax returns for 2013, 2014, and 2015 in April or May 2016. He vowed to 
change his practices and will no longer allow his filings to lapse in the future.3  
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant added:4  
I have and do file my taxes for every year. Since I know I don’t owe I maybe 
sometimes file late but I always follow the tax laws and do file my taxes. . .  
I have never failed to file or pay any taxes I owe. If I would have owed over 
the past three years in question I would have paid. I hadn’t filed at the time 
of my interview or the time I was doing the questionnaire. During my 
interview with the agent I did inform him I had already dropped my taxes off 
to get them done and just needed to go sign them so they could be sent off. 
In July 2017, Applicant stated:5 
I was under the impression that if I didn’t owe the IRS, I had more time to 
file than I had. I accept full responsibility for my lack of knowledge in these 
matters. This was clearly a misunderstanding/oversight on my part and it 
will not occur again. I do acknowledge that calendar years 2013, 2014 and 
2015 were filed late in 2016. Also my lack of knowledge in this subject was 
the basis for failing to file for an extension. I honestly was not aware that it 
was time sensitive if I didn’t owe money. . . . In the future, I will ensure that 
my taxes are filed prior to the deadline. 
The SOR alleged that Applicant had failed to file his federal income tax returns for 
the tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015, as required. Their current status, according to the 
evidence submitted by the Government and Applicant, and Applicant’s comments 
regarding same, are described below:  
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): the federal income tax return for the tax year 2013 was not filed as 
required. Applicant submitted a copy of his 2013 Form 1040, 2013 Form 2555-EZ, and a 
2013 IRS e-file Signature Authorization (Form 8879), that reflected that an identified tax 
preparer completed the Form 1040 on May 2, 2016, and that the Forms 1040 and 2555-
EZ were electronically filed on June 6, 2016. The Form 1040 was erroneously dated by 
Applicant as June 6, 2015.6 The IRS confirmed that the income tax return was received 
on June 6, 2016 – over four months before the SOR was issued.7  According to 
                                                          
3 Item 5 (Personal Subject Interview, dated March 31, 2016), at 11. 
 
4 Item 3 (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated November 10, 2016), at 3. 
 
5 Memorandum, dated July 26, 2017, attached to Applicant’s Initial Response to the FORM. 
 
6 2013 Form 1040 and 2013 Form 8879, attached to Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. There is also an invoice 
from the income tax return preparer, dated June 6, 2016, that indicates Applicant was charged $320 for the preparation 
of the necessary documentation. 
 
7 IRS Account Transcript, dated July 31, 2017, attached to Applicant’s Initial Response to the FORM. 
 
6 
                                      
 
Applicant’s filing, his entire wage of $74,312 was considered as foreign income exclusion, 
and he had zero taxable income. Department Counsel argued persuasively that there is 
no evidence to support a conclusion that Applicant had followed the process of applying 
for the appropriate extensions available under IRS Pub. 54, described above, or that the 
2013 federal income tax return had been timely filed. Nevertheless, the return has been 
filed before the SOR was issued. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.a.): the federal income tax return for the tax year 2014 was not filed as 
required. Applicant submitted a copy of his 2014 Form 1040, 2014 Form 2555-EZ, and a 
2014 Form 8879, that reflected that an identified tax preparer completed the Form 1040 
on June 6, 2016, and that the Forms 1040 and 2555-EZ were electronically filed on June 
6, 2016. The Form 1040 was dated by Applicant as June 6, 2016.8 The IRS confirmed 
that the income tax return was received on June 6, 2016 – over four months before the 
SOR was issued.9 According to Applicant’s filing, his entire wage of $78,477 was 
considered as foreign income exclusion, and he had zero taxable income. Once again, 
Department Counsel argued persuasively that there is no evidence to support a 
conclusion that Applicant had followed the process of applying for the appropriate 
extensions available under IRS Pub. 54, described above, or that the 2014 federal income 
tax return had been timely filed. Nevertheless, the return has been filed before the SOR 
was issued. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): the federal income tax return for the tax year 2015 was not filed as 
required. Applicant submitted a copy of his 2015 Form 1040, 2015 Form 2555-EZ, and a 
2015 Form 8879, that reflected that an identified tax preparer completed the Form 1040 
on June 6, 2016, and that the Forms 1040 and 2555-EZ were electronically filed on June 
6, 2016. The Form 1040 was dated by Applicant as June 6, 2016.10 The IRS confirmed 
that the income tax return was received on June 6, 2016 – over four months before the 
SOR was issued.11 According to Applicant’s filing, his entire wage of $56,536 was 
considered as foreign income exclusion, and he had zero taxable income. Applicant 
qualified for an automatic two-month extension to file his return and pay federal income 
taxes because he is a U.S. citizen, and on the regular due date of the return, he is living 
outside the United States and his main place of business is outside the United States. 
Accordingly, Applicant’s federal income tax return for the tax year 2015 was timely filed.  
  
                                                          
 
8 2014 Form 1040 and 2014 Form 8879, attached to Applicant’s Answer to the SOR. There is also an invoice 
from the income tax return preparer, dated June 6, 2016, that indicates Applicant was charged $330 for the preparation 
of the necessary documentation.

from the income tax return preparer, dated June 6, 2016, that indicates Applicant was charged $290 for the preparation 
of the necessary documentation.

Personal Conduct 
 On March 27, 2015, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he responded to a 
question pertaining to his taxes. The question in Section 26 – Financial Record asked if, 
in the past seven years, he had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when 
required by law or ordinance. Applicant answered “no” to the question. He certified that 
the response was “true, complete, and correct” to the best of his knowledge and belief, 
but the response to that question was, in fact, technically false. Applicant subsequently 
denied intending to falsify his response. He attributed his actions to a misunderstanding 
of various aspects of filing requirements, the time-sensitivity of filing, and the necessity of 
requesting extensions. 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”12 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”13   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”14 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
                                                          
12 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). 
 
13 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and 
modified.    
 
14 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support 
a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) 
(citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). 
 
8 
                                      
 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.15  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”16 
  
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”17 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision on any express 
or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an 
indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the President and the 
Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, 
I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded 
on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
                                                          
 
15 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

17 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
9 
                                      
 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes one condition that could raise security concerns under AG ¶ 
19: (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. Applicant failed to 
file his federal income tax returns for 2013 and 2014 until June 2016, without filing the 
necessary extension requests. He filed his federal income tax return for 2015 in June 
2016, within the automatic extension period. As to the federal income tax returns for the 
tax years 2013 and 2014, AG ¶ 19(f) has been established. As to the federal income tax 
return for the tax year 2015, the Government has failed to prove the SOR allegation. 
    
The guideline also includes an example of a condition that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: (g) the individual has made 
arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in 
compliance with those arrangements.  
AG ¶ 20(g) applies. Shortly before he was interviewed by an OPM investigator, 
Applicant furnished his income tax return preparer the financial paperwork necessary to 
prepare and file his federal income tax returns for three years. Over four months before 
the SOR was issued, Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2013, 
2014, and 2015. The IRS confirmed that the income tax returns were received on June 
6, 2016. Applicant did not owe the IRS any unpaid taxes for those three years. While the 
return for 2015 was considered timely filed, the federal income tax returns for the tax 
years 2013 and 2014 were not timely filed as no extensions had been requested as set 
forth in IRS Pub. 54. Applicant attributed his failure to make the timely filings to his 
misunderstanding of the filing rules. He was under the impression that if he didn’t owe the 
IRS, he had more time to file than he actually had. He acknowledged that it was clearly a 
misunderstanding or oversight on his part and that it will not occur again. His lack of 
knowledge was the basis for his failing to file for the appropriate extensions, it was not 
the delayed avoidance of paying owed taxes. He was not aware that it was time sensitive 
if he didn’t owe money. Applicant vowed that in the future, he will file his income tax 
returns prior to the deadline.  
Federal income tax rules and regulations are confusing, even those set forth in 
IRS Pub. 54. The Commerce Clearing House (CCH) publishes the Standard Federal Tax 
Reporter consisting of 70,000 pages, with notations after each statute containing relevant 
cases and other information. CCH considers this volume to be representative of “the tax 
 
10 
                                      
 
code,” since an expert needs to know all 70,000 pages to understand the tax code in 
full.18 Applicant is not considered an expert.  
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. When the security concerns involve tax issues, when an individual 
has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed 
and is in compliance with those arrangements, the concern may be mitigated. In this 
instance, there was no amounts owed and unpaid. The sole issue was Applicant’s failure 
to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2013 and 2014. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of each and every issue alleged in the SOR. 
An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take 
significant actions to implement the plan. A reasonable plan and concomitant conduct 
may provide for the resolution of his financial issues one at a time. In this instance, 
Applicant’s overall plan was to file his delinquent federal income tax returns, and he did 
so, significantly before the SOR was issued. 
 
Under the circumstances, Applicant has acted responsibly by addressing his 
delinquent federal income tax returns and seeing to it that they were filed, albeit too late 
to meet the deadlines with approved extensions. Applicant’s actions, under the 
circumstances, no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.19 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in 
AG ¶ 18: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in 
an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance 
action, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: 
 
(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or 
cooperate with security processing, including but not limited 
to meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, 
completing security forms or releases, cooperation with 
medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph 
examination, if authorized and required; and

19 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
 
11 
                                      
 
(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful 
questions of investigators, security officials, or other official 
representatives in connection with a personnel security or 
trustworthiness determination. 
 
The guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns under AG ¶ 16:  
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar 
form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, 
award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or 
trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
 As noted above, on March 27, 2015, when Applicant completed his e-QIP, he 
responded to a question pertaining to his financial record. The question in Section 26 – 
Financial Record asked if, in the past seven years, he had failed to file or pay Federal, 
state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance. Applicant answered “no” to the 
question. He certified that the response was “true, complete, and correct” to the best of 
his knowledge and belief, but the response to that question was, in fact, technically false. 
Applicant subsequently denied intending to falsify his response. He attributed his actions 
to a misunderstanding of various aspects of filing requirements, the time-sensitivity of 
filing, and the necessity of requesting extensions. 
 
 Applicant’s comments provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submission was 
a deliberate falsification, as alleged in the SOR, or merely an omission that was the result 
of oversight or misunderstanding of the true facts on his part. Proof of an omission, 
standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant’s intent or state of mind when 
the falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I must consider the 
record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is a direct or circumstantial 
evidence concerning Applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the alleged falsification 
or omission occurred. I have considered the entire record, including Applicant’s initial and 
subsequent comments.20 
 
                                                          
20 The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating: 
 
(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of 
proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove 
an applicant’s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must 
consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or 
circumstantial evidence concerning the applicant’s intent or state of mind at the time the 
omission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude 
Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the burden 
of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the omission.  
 
ISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). See 
also ISCR Case No. 08-05637 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010) (noting an applicant’s level of education and other 
experiences are part of entirety-of-the-record evaluation as to whether a failure to disclose past-due debts on a security 
clearance application was deliberate).  
 
 
12 
                                      
 
Applicant’s explanations for his submission, in my view, were that he essentially 
misunderstood the question in its entirety. Applicant attributed his failure to make the 
timely filings to his misunderstanding of the filing rules. He was under the impression that 
if he didn’t owe the IRS, he had more time to file than he actually had. He acknowledged 
that it was clearly a misunderstanding or oversight on his part. His lack of knowledge was 
the basis for his failing to file for the appropriate extensions, it was not the delayed 
avoidance of paying owed taxes. He was not aware that it was time sensitive if he didn’t 
owe money. The question to which Applicant is alleged to have deliberately lied is not 
that clear. In asking if he had failed to file or pay his taxes when required by law, without 
further explanation as to what the phrase means, leaves room for uncertainty. Applicant 
did not fail to pay any taxes, as he did not owe any taxes. Applicant did not fail to file his 
income tax returns, for he did so. Applicant acknowledged that he was required to file his 
income tax returns as required by law. What he failed to appreciate was the significance 
of the term “when.” While the financially sophisticated might be aware of the correct 
meaning, it is unclear if the word referred to a specific date, or if it referred to the simple 
act of filing. In light of Applicant’s explanations, and in the absence of more persuasive 
evidence to the contrary, I conclude that AG ¶ 16(a) has not been established. Applicant’s 
actions under the circumstances do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.21   
 
                                                          
21 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. 
Jun. 2, 2006). 
 
 
13 
                                      
 
 There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. He failed to timely 
file federal income tax returns for the tax years 2013 and 2014, and he failed to 
acknowledge his failures in his e-QIP. 
  
 The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more 
substantial. Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving overseas since August 2001. He served on active duty until he was honorably 
retired in July 2001. He was granted a secret security clearance in 1981, and maintained 
that clearance through subsequent reinvestigations. Over four months before the SOR 
was issued, Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2013, 2014, 
and 2015. The IRS confirmed that the income tax returns were received on June 6, 2016. 
Applicant did not owe the IRS any unpaid taxes for those three years. While the return for 
2015 was considered timely filed, the federal income tax returns for the tax years 2013 
and 2014 were not timely filed as no extensions had been requested as set forth in IRS 
Pub. 54. Applicant misunderstood the filing rules. He was under the impression that if he 
didn’t owe the IRS, he had more time to file than he actually had. He acknowledged that 
it was clearly a misunderstanding or oversight on his part and that it will not occur again. 
His lack of knowledge was the basis for his failing to file for the appropriate extensions, it 
was not the delayed avoidance of paying owed taxes. He was not aware that it was time 
sensitive if he didn’t owe money. Applicant vowed that in the future, he will file his income 
tax returns prior to the deadline.  
 
Overall, the evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations 
and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d)(1) through AG ¶ 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
   
Subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:   For Applicant 
   
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a.:     For Applicant 
      
  
 
14 
                                      
 
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
