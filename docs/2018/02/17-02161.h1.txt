FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
History of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on March 11, 2015. On July 
1, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) 
sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. 
The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on 
September 1, 2006.1 
                                                          
1 Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4) was issued on December 10, 2016, revising the 2006 
adjudicative guidelines for all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. The changes 
resulting from issuance of SEAD 4 did not affect my decision in this case.

 Applicant answered the SOR on July 21, 2017, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 18, 
2017, and the case was assigned to me on October 23, 2017. On November 9, 2017, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing 
was scheduled for December 5, 2017. I convened the hearing as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through K, which were 
admitted without objection. I kept the record open until December 20, 2017, to enable 
him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX L, M, and N, 
which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 
12, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.e, and 1.f. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. His admissions in his answer and at the 
hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 39-year-old logistics analyst employed by a defense contractor 
since December 2012. He has been employed by defense contractors since November 
2002. He has held a security clearance since November 2004.  
 
 Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in industrial technology in May 2000 and a 
master’s degree in engineering management in May 2010. He has never married. He 
has a 14-year-old daughter, who lives with him. 
 
 Due to federal budget cuts, Applicant’s salary was reduced by 18.25% on 
October 1, 2014, reducing his take-home pay per two-week pay period from $1,568 to 
$1,308. In June 2016, his part-time job was eliminated when his employer went out of 
business, reducing his income by about $100 per week. (Tr. 27.) His gross income was 
$56,046 for tax year 2014; $46,797 for tax year 2015; and $47,617 for tax year 2016. As 
a result of his reduced income, he fell behind in his payments on a credit-card account 
and his home-mortgage loan. (Attachments to SOR Answer; Tr. 27.) He incurred federal 
tax debts for $3,981 for tax year 2013 and $2,973 for tax year 2014, because he had 
insufficient tax withholding from his pay. (Tr. 28.) 
 
 The SOR alleges a delinquent credit-card account charged off for $3,570 (SOR ¶ 
1.a); home-mortgage loan payments past due for $2,465 (SOR ¶ 1.b); failure to timely 
file federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.c); and failure 
to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016 (SOR ¶ 
1.d). It also alleges a federal tax debt of $3,981 for tax year 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.e) and a 
federal tax debt of $2,973 for tax year 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.f). 
 
                                                          
2 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

 Applicant negotiated a payment plan for the credit-card debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, 
providing for monthly payments of $37.50. He has reduced the amount of the debt from 
$3,570 to $3,195. (Tr. 29-30; AX A.) 
 
 In July 2017, Applicant applied for borrower’s assistance from a state agency, 
and his application was approved in November 2017. His monthly payments have been 
reduced from $1,053 to $740, and he made the December 2017 payment. After three 
months, his payments will be adjusted to reflect any change in his income. If he misses 
any payments, his participation in the assistance program will be terminated. (Tr. 30-31; 
AX B.) 
 
 Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2012 in August 2015 and owed 
$701 for that year. He established an installment agreement in November 2015 and 
made a $25 payment in September 2016. The installment agreement was terminated in 
December 2016. (Attachment to SOR Answer.) 
 
 Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2013 in June 2014 and owed 
$2,932. He made a $284 payment in August 2015 and entered into an installment 
agreement in November 2015. The installment agreement was terminated in December 
2016. (GX 2 at 5-6.) 
 
 Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2014 in September 2015 and 
owed $2,416. He entered into an installment agreement in November 2015, which was 
terminated in December 2016. (GX 2 at 7-8.) 
 
 In November 2017, Applicant applied for an installment agreement for an 
estimated $7,000 federal income tax debt, offering to pay $50 per month. (AX H.) As of 
the date of the hearing, he had not received a response to his request. (Tr. 41.) The 
instructions on the request for an installment agreement required that he submit an IRS 
Form 433-F, Collection Information Statement, because the amount of his tax debt 
divided by 72 was greater than $97 per month. He admitted that he did not submit the 
IRS Form 433-F with his request. (Tr. 42.) 
 
 Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2015 in December 2017. The 
return reflects that he was entitled to a refund of $477. (AX L, N, and M.) He testified 
that he did not file this return on time because he could not afford to pay a tax preparer. 
(Tr. 39.) 
 
 Applicant’s federal income tax return for 2016 reflects that he is entitled to a 
refund of $66. (AX D.) He testified that he filed it shortly before the hearing, but he 
submitted no documentation showing that the return was filed. 
 
 Applicant filed his state income tax returns for 2012, 2013, and 2014 in 
November 2017. (AX J and K.) He submitted the TurboTax cover sheets for the 2015 
and 2016 state returns, but he provided no evidence that the returns were submitted to 
the state tax authority. (AX E at 2, F, and G.) As of July 2017, all state income taxes that 
 
4 
 
were due had been collected by a tax levy on his wages. (AX E at 1; Attachments to 
SOR Answer.) Although the collection is listed as a tax levy on his pay statements, he 
testified that he started the payments voluntarily. (Tr. 44.) 
 
 Applicant testified that he failed to timely file his federal and state income tax 
returns for 2012 because he “just got sidetracked.” (Tr. 37.) He did not file his 2013 
returns because he could not afford to pay the taxes due and “was just trying to buy 
[himself] time.” (Tr. 38, 41.) He admitted that he gave paying taxes a lower priority than 
other household expenses. (Tr. 38.) 
 
 Applicant estimated that his net monthly remainder after paying all his expenses 
is about $200. (Tr. 46.) Shortly before the hearing, Applicant paid off his car loan, and 
he now has an additional $500 per month available. (Tr. 33.) At the time of the hearing, 
he had only about $200 in his checking account, nothing in his savings account, and 
about $9,000 in his 401(k) account. He has never sought or received financial 
counseling. (Tr. 47.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
 
5 
 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-
01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 
6 
 
 Applicant’s answer to the SOR, his testimony at the hearing, and the 
documentary evidence submitted by both parties establish the following disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required. 
 
 The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, 
and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. His repeated 
failures to timely file his federal and state income tax returns cast doubt on his current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
AG ¶¶ 20(b) and 20(d) are established for the credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 
1.a and the delinquent mortgage-loan payments alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. They are not 
established for Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns, 
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, and his federal tax debt for 2013 and 2014, alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f.  
 
 
7 
 
Applicant’s pay reduction and the loss of his part-time job were circumstances 
beyond his control. He acted responsibly by making payment agreements for his credit-
card account and his home-mortgage loan and complying with his payment 
agreements. He has not acted responsibly regarding his federal and state income tax 
debts. He took no significant action to resolve his federal tax debt until he made a $284 
payment in August 2015 and made an installment agreement in November 2015. The 
record is unclear about the starting date for the state tax levy. He requested an 
installment agreement for his federal tax debts in November 2017, but he admitted that 
he did not submit the required financial documentation.  
 
Applicant did not file his past-due federal and state income tax returns until 2015. 
He has offered no valid excuse for not filing his federal and state income tax returns on 
time. His inability to pay the taxes due does not excuse his failure to file the federal and 
state returns as required. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal 
obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability 
required of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 
4 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. 
McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961) 
 
 AG ¶ 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant has filed his federal and state 
income tax returns for 2012-2014. He filed his federal income tax return for 2015. He 
claimed that he filed his federal return for 2016 and the state returns for 2015 and 2016, 
but he failed to produce documentary evidence to support his claim. The fact that 
Applicant has filed some of his past-due returns “does not preclude careful 
consideration of his security worthiness based on longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility.” ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). 
Furthermore, the establishment of some mitigating evidence does not compel a 
favorable security-clearance decision. ISCR Case No. 11-14784 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 
2014).  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).3  
 
                                                          
3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
8 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis and applied the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of 
the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised 
by his multiple failures to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and failure 
to take meaningful steps to resolve his federal tax debt. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.f:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Clearance is denied.
