LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He failed to timely file state and federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2015. He was also cited for three security 
infractions at the workplace during 2012-2014. More recently in 2016, he failed to 
properly lock the door to a secured laboratory. None of his conduct was deliberate, but 
was due to negligence, carelessness, or inattention. Taken together, these matters 
reflect a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
trustworthiness that militate against a favorable clearance decision. Accordingly, this 
case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on November 7, 2014.1 This document is commonly known as

a security clearance application. Thereafter, on September 20, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guidelines known as Guideline K for handling protected 
information and Guideline F for financial considerations.   
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 22, 2016. He admitted the factual 
allegations under Guideline K and he partially admitted and partially denied the 
allegations under Guideline F. He also requested a hearing before an administrative 
judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on March 15, 2017. The hearing took place as 
scheduled on April 27, 2017. Applicant appeared with counsel. Both Department 
Counsel and Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 
1-5 and A-P, respectively. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on May 8, 2017. 
The record was kept open to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional 
documentary matters, and those matters are admitted without objections as Exhibits Q 
and R.  
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 60-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security 
clearance. His educational background includes a bachelor’s degree awarded in 1998.2 
He is employed by a large defense contractor as a senior software engineer. He has 
been so employed since 2005. His work involves software-configuration management, 
which includes performing trusted downloads on a regular basis. He has never married 
and has no children. His employment history includes active duty in the U.S. Air Force 
during 1980-1984, which concluded with an honorable discharge. He has a good 
employment record and is considered a trustworthy employee according to two 
character witnesses and four letters of recommendation submitted by co-workers.3 
 
In his November 2014 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he 
failed to timely file state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013.4 
He explained his failure was due to his decision to quit using the services of an 
accountant and procrastination. He further stated he would not owe any back taxes and 
was due refunds. He provided additional information about his failures to file during his 
August 2015 background investigation.5

3 Exhibits B and D; Tr. 6-23 and 43-57.

5 Exhibit 2.

At the hearing, Applicant explained that he had used an accountant on an on-
again, off-again basis because he was concerned about the expense.6 He attributed his 
failure to file tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013 to procrastination.7 From tax year 
2014 forward, he decided to use the services of an accountant.8 In addition, he 
submitted a signed statement of intent wherein he pledged to never fail to pay his 
federal and state income taxes.9 
 
Applicant’s documentation includes IRS account transcripts for the last eight tax 
years (2009-2016), which show that he failed to timely file federal tax returns for 2012, 
2013, and 2015.10 He filed for 2012 and 2013 in May 2015. He was due refunds from 
the IRS for all eight tax years. Although he had the assistance of an accountant, he 
failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for 2015. He filed the returns in 
March 2017, about a month before the hearing in this case, and he was due refunds.11 
Indeed, he presented a May 2017 certificate of compliance from his state tax authority 
showing that he is in good standing having filed and paid all taxes due.12 
 
In addition to the tax matters, Applicant’s employer cited him three times (once in 
2012 and twice in 2014) for security infractions stemming from the failure to follow 
proper procedures while performing trusted downloads.13 There was no indication that 
classified or sensitive information was compromised during any of the three incidents. 
Investigations also determined that both the second and third incidents were 
inadvertent.14 After the second incident, he was directed to complete remedial training. 
After the third incident, he was directed to participate in one-on-one remedial training 
with a manager. He self-reported all three incidents.15 
 
Applicant estimates that he has performed more than 1,000 trusted downloads 
since his employment commenced in 2005. He attributes the security infractions to 
honest mistakes made during the press of business. He has had no other issues with 
performing trusted downloads since the third incident in 2014. His lessons learned

include double-checking work, being paranoid in a healthy way, and not relying too 
much on the representations of others who he assists in performing trusted downloads.  
 
More recently in 2016, Applicant failed to properly lock a door to a secured 
laboratory.16 When informed by the lab manager, he was dumbfounded because this is 
a task he frequently performs. To address this issue, he has changed the process by 
which he closes the lab at the end of the day and locks the door.17 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.18 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.19 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”20 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.21 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.22 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.23 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.24

 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.25 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.26 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.27 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.28 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . .29 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive 
information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income 
tax as required;  and  
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.

 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. That history is 
established by the failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns for 2012, 
2013, and 2015.30 He is now in compliance with the state and federal tax authorities 
having filed the 2012 and 2013 returns in May 2015 and the 2015 returns in March 
2017, and he does not owe back taxes. Given these circumstances, the mitigating 
condition at AG ¶ 20(g) applies in Applicant’s favor.  
 
 Nevertheless, the failure to timely file tax returns and pay tax when due bears 
close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the federal government.31 The 
failure to file returns when due suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying 
with well-established governmental rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with 
such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified or sensitive information. An 
applicant who has a history of not fulfilling their tax obligations, which is the case here, 
may be said not to have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability 
required for access to classified or sensitive information. My assessment is that 
Applicant’s failures to file, while not willful or deliberate, were due to negligence, 
carelessness, or inattention resulting from procrastination.  
 
 Under Guideline K for handling protected information, the suitability of an 
applicant may be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of 
deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for handling 
protected information, which includes classified, sensitive, or proprietary information.32 
In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions as most pertinent:  
 
AG ¶ 34(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified 
or sensitive information;  
 
AG ¶ 34(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite 
counseling by management;    
 
AG ¶ 35(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has 
happened so infrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s current 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
                                                          
30 The SOR allegations are limited to tax years 2012 and 2013. Because tax year 2015 was not alleged, it 
is uncharged conduct that I considered for the limited purpose of assessing the frequency and recency of 
the conduct as well as the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of the conduct.   
 
31 The General Accountability Office (GAO) expressed serious concern over the relationship between tax 
delinquents and clearance holders in its July 28, 2014 report, Security Clearances: Tax Debts Owed by 
DOD Employees and Contractors, http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665052.pdf. 
 
32 AG ¶ 33.  
 
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 35(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial 
security training and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the 
discharge of security requirements; and 
 
AG ¶ 35(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is 
no evidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. 
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic history of 
handling protected information. That history is established by the three security 
infractions he committed during 2012-2014 when he failed to follow proper procedures 
while performing trusted downloads. More recently in 2016, he failed to properly lock the 
door to a secured laboratory.33 I have considered the mitigating conditions mentioned 
above and I conclude the following: (1) AG ¶ 35(a) applies in part but not fully, because 
the behavior occurred four times since 2012, which is not infrequent, and the latest 
incident was in 2016, which is recent; (2) AG ¶ 35(b) applies fully; and (3) AG ¶ 35(c) 
applies in part but not fully, because four security incidents since 2012 is indicative of a 
pattern. My overall assessment is that the security infractions, while not willful or 
deliberate, were due to negligence, carelessness, or inattention resulting from the press 
of business.  
 
  Although the SOR allegations involve different factual matters under different 
security guidelines, I have considered the tax matters and the security infractions 
together. It is my view that the common thread joining them is Applicant’s negligence, 
carelessness, or inattention. Taken together, the tax matters and security infractions 
reflect a recent or recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or 
trustworthiness that militate against a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this 
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence 
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person 
concept. On that point, Applicant impressed me as a sincere, dedicated, and hard-
working employee who enjoys his job. Nevertheless, I conclude that he did not meet his 
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline K:   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   Against Applicant 
 
  Paragraph 2, Guideline F:   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:   Against Applicant 
                                                          
33 The SOR allegations are limited to the three security infractions during 2012-2014. Because the 2016 
incident was not alleged, it is uncharged conduct that I considered for the limited purpose of assessing 
the frequency and recency of the conduct as well as the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of the 
conduct.

Conclusion 
 
 It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to 
classified information.
