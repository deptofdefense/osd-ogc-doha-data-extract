 Decision
______________
WESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant  
mitigated the security concerns regarding his financial considerations. Eligibility for
access to classified information is granted.
 
Statement of Case
On November 25, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons
why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a
security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine
whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The
action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified
Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as
amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on
September 1, 2006.  
The Security Executive Agent, by Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative
Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, superceded and replaced the
September 2006 adjudicative guidelines (AGs). They apply to all covered individuals
who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility
to hold a sensitive position. Procedures for administrative due process for contractor
personnel continue to be governed by DOD Directive 5220.6, subject to the updated
substantive changes in the AGs, effective June 8, 2017. Application of the AGs that
were in effect when the SOR was issued would not affect my decision in this case.
Applicant responded to the SOR on December 11, 2016, and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on June 20, 2017, and scheduled for hearing on August 1,
2017. The Government’s case consisted of ten exhibits. (GEs 1-10) Applicant relied on
one witness (himself) and eight exhibits. (AEs A-H) The transcript was received on
August 10, 2017.
Procedural Issues
Before the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to
permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with an updated mortgage statement
from his home lender who foreclosed on his home in 2011. For good cause shown,
Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was
afforded two days to respond. Applicant did not supplement the record.
Summary of Pleadings
Under Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in
March 1992 (dismissed in March 1993); (b) filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in
December 1995 (discharged in March 1996); (c) filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in
February 2012 (discharged in November 2014); (d) incurred a student loan delinquency in
the amount of $45,736; and (e) failed to timely file federal tax returns for tax years 2009
and 2011-2012, as required. Allegedly, the timely filing of his tax returns for tax years
2009 and 2011-2012  and incurred student loan debt have not been resolved.  
                
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations covered by SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.d with explanations, while denying the allegations covered by SOR ¶ 1.e with
explanations. He claimed he pursued a loan modification with his first home lender and
was unsuccessful. He further claimed that after he was denied a loan modification for the
last time in 2011, his home was foreclosed and sold. He claimed that he engaged an
attorney and after fulfilling his retainer agreement payments ($2,200 in advance) called
for in his retainer agreement, filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in 2012 and was
granted a discharge upon completing his payment plan in November 2014.
Addressing his student loan debts, Applicant claimed that he co-signed for a
student loan for his son, who ceased making payments on the loan while unemployed
and unable to obtain a deferment. Applicant claimed that he worked out an approved
payment plan with the lender and has been making agreed $250 monthly payments to the
lender.  He also claimed to have respect for the security process and emphasized his
2
service in the Gulf War as an Air Force enlistee, only to return to face divorce and
bankruptcies in 1992 and 1995, and again in 2012. 
      Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 50-year-old staff field engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a
security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in June 1986 and divorced in March 1991. (GEs 1 and 4 and
Applicant’s SOR response) He has one child from this marriage. He remarried in April
1994 and has one child from this marriage. (GEs 1 and 4 and Applicant’s SOR response) 
Applicant earned an associate’s degree in February 2005. He took on-line classes
between November 1999 and May 2006 and other classes between January 2015 and
the present.. He reported no degree or diploma in either instance (GE 1) He enlisted in
the Air Force (AF) in September 1985 and served 21 years of active duty before being
granted an honorable discharge for medical reasons in March 2006. (GE 1 and AE I)
Applicant has worked for his current defense contractor employer since August
2008 on a recurrent basis. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 71-72)  Between March 2006 and August 2008,
he worked as a criminal intelligence analyst for a federal government agency. (GEs 1-2;
tr. 68-69)
Applicant’s finances
After returning from military deployment in 1992, Applicant encountered divorce-
related financial issues that he was ill-prepared to address. In an effort to buy him more
time to pay off his accumulated debts, he filed for Chapter 13 relief in March 1992. (GEs
1-2, Applicant’s SOR response, AE A) Unable to keep up with the payments with his
limited income, he fell behind with his trustee payments, and his Chapter 13 petition was
dismissed by the court. (GE 5) On the advice of his bankruptcy counsel, he petitioned for
Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief in December 1995. (GE 6) Applicant’s Chapter 7 petition was
discharged in March 1996 as a no-asset case. (GE 6)
Following his After purchase of a second home in April 2010, Applicant
encountered difficulties in keeping up with his mortgage payments on the $222,285
mortgage covering the first home he purchased in May 2006 for around $200,000. After
missing a payment in July 2010, he explored loan modifications with his lender. (GEs 2
and 8-10, Applicant’s SOR response, and AE A; Tr. 75-76, 79-82, 89-90) Unable to work
out a loan modification with the lender on his first home after purchasing his second
home, he lost the first home to foreclosure by the first mortgagee in 2011. (GEs 3, 8-10,
and AE A) After selling the home at public auction for $130,000, the lender was left with a
$70,000 deficiency balance on the loan. (Tr. 76-77)
3
On the advice of his bankruptcy attorney, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 relief
in February 2012. (GE 7) In his petition, he listed the $216,378 mortgage claim of his
current mortgagee on his second home, as well as unsecured, nonpriority claims totaling
$161,148 and an unsecured priority tax lien of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of
$1,900 for 2009 taxes owed. (GE 7)
Applicant completed the requirements of his approved Chapter 13 plan (inclusive
of on-line credit counseling) and was credited by the Chapter 13 trustee with making
trustee payments of $17,094. (GE 7) Payments included the balance of funds owed the
IRS under his 2011 installment agreement. Applicant received his Chapter 13 discharge
in November 2014. (GE 7) 
Records confirm that Applicant co-signed for a private student loan to his son in
October 2006. (GEs 8-10) For the first four years, Applicant’s son was able to cover the
monthly payments called for under the terms of his student loan. (GEs 8-10 and AE A; Tr.
113) By June 2015, Applicant’s son had ceased making payments on the loan and
defaulted on the note’s terms. After earning an associate’s degree in 2015, his son 
worked part-time jobs while looking for full-time employment and did not have enough
money to make his loan payments. (Tr. 113) 
Called upon by the lender to honor his loan obligations as a co-signor of the loan,
Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the lender in January 2013. (AE B)
Applicant has continued to make the $250 monthly payments called for in his loan
agreement since January 2017. (AE B) When he has completed 12 payments, he will be
eligible to complete a permanent payment agreement. (AE B and Applicant’s SOR
response) To date, he has made monthly loan payments exceeding $3,200. (AE B)
Both in Applicant’s tax transcripts covering tax year 2009 and in the installment
agreement he completed in August 2011 covering tax year 2009, he was credited by the
IRS with filing his 2009 federal tax return untimely in March 2011. (GE 2) Penalties for
untimely filing were imposed by the IRS in the amount of $865. (GE 2 and AEs D-E; Tr.
91) Under the terms of his installment agreement, he agreed to make monthly payments
of $100, to run until the IRS’s calculated $5,364 debt for tax year 2009 is fully paid. (AE
D) Applicant’s payments included trustee payments under his 2012 Chapter 13 petition to
satisfy the IRS’s $1,900 priority tax claim on moneys still owed by Applicant pursuant to
the terms of his 2011 installment agreement with the IRS. (GE 7) Applicant completed his
installment plan in 2016 and has a zero balance for tax payments owed for tax year 2009.
(GE 2; Tr. 94-95)
By contrast, Applicant documented his timely filing of his 2010 federal tax return in
March 201 and issued $3,596 refund, adjusted to cover taxes owed for 2009. (GE 2; Tr.
91-92) While Applicant’s 2011 tax return reflects a June 2012 filing date, no penalties for
late filing were reported in the IRS transcript covering the 2011 tax year. (GE 2) The best
inferences to draw is that Applicant requested and received an automatic filing extension,
4
good for six months.(GE 2) The transcript covering Applicant’s 2011 tax period reported
no taxes owing for this tax year. (GE 2)
Similar to the tax reporting detailed in Applicant’s 2009 IRS transcript, Applicant’s
IRS transcript covering tax year 2012 reported his untimely filing of his tax return for that
year. For 2012, Applicant was credited with filing his 2012 tax return in August 2013 and
reporting an amount due of $2,173. (GE 2 and AE C) While Applicant could not be certain
of including an extension request with his filed return (Tr. 91), the IRS transcript for tax
year 2012 reported an imposed penalty of $293 for late filing and added interest for his
late payment. (GE 2) The transcript made no mention of an extension request. (GE 2) The
IRS transcript covering tax year 2012 confirmed that Applicant’s 2011 installment
agreement was satisfied in May 2016. (GE 2)
Tax transcripts covering Applicant’s filed tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014
report timely filings with no late filing penalties imposed for either year. (GE 2) Likewise,
Applicant is credited with filing a timely federal tax return for tax year 2015. (GE 2) Neither
transcript noted any penalties imposed for late filing.
Character references, awards, and commendations
Applicant is well-regarded by his managers and supervisors. (AE J) They credited
him with displaying exceptional leadership and being a person with a strong moral
compass and a history of success in meeting current and future challenges. (AE J) 
Applicant’s managers and supervisors noted Applicant’s unique ability to mentor
and help subordinates and customers in exercising sound maintenance practices and
delivering quality services. They both vouched for his trustworthiness and reliability and
describe him as a highly successful supervisor, committed to achieving results in the
performance of his job and being accountable to others.  (AE J) 
During his 21 years of military service, Applicant earned a number of awards and
commendations recognizing his Air Force service. (AE I) His cited awards include the
following: AF Recognition Medal; National Defense Service Medal w/1 Bronze Service Star
(BSS); Southwest Asia Service Medal; Korean Defense Service Medal; Global War on
Terror Service Medal; AF Overseas Long Tour Ribbon w/1 OLC; AF Longevity Service
Award w/4 OLCs; NCO Professional Military Education Graduate Ribbon w/1 OLC; Small
Arms Expert Marksmanship ribbon/Rifle; AF Training Ribbon; and Kuwait Liberation
Medal. (AE I)  
Applicant’s performance evaluations covering the periods of June 2009 through
February 2016 credited Applicant with composite ratings exceeding commitments. (AE K)
His overall ratings include consistent credits for his demonstrated personal integrity,
honesty and conduct throughout every category of job appraisal. (AE K) Noted
performance attributes are doing what is right, respecting others, and performing with
excellence. (AE K)

Policies
                
       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the
decision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into
account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,
as well as considerations that could affect the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and
ability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and
many of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security
clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require
administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and
mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to
be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG ¶ 2(c).
In addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG
¶ 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial
commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines
within the context of the whole person. 
The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an
applicant’s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is
an acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG ¶ 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the
nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or
recurrence.
 Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual
guidelines are pertinent in this case:
Financial Considerations
       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy
debts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which
can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and
ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can
also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,
other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,
mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of
6
dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater
risk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to
generate funds. . . .  AG ¶ 18.
Burden of Proof
By virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or
continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding
that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive
requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence
accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a
security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that
evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  
As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences
which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the
judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.
The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial
evidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that
the facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain
a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or
abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,
the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.
Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or
controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of
establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,
or mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances
be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of
demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. “[S]ecurity-clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” See Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). 
Analysis  
Security concerns are raised over Applicant’s record of recurrent petitions for
Chapter 13 relief between 1992 and 2014, one of which was converted into a Chapter 7
petition in 1995 and ultimately discharged in 1996. Additional security concerns are
raised over Applicant’s failure to promptly address a default and charge-off of a student
loan that Applicant co-signed for his son in 2006.  And security concerns are raised over
Applicant’s failure to timely file his 2009 and 2011-2012 federal tax returns.
7
Applicant’s bankruptcy petitions (three in all) filed over a 12-year period, his
incurring of a delinquent student loan debt as a co-signer for his son, and his failure to
file timely federal tax returns in 2009 and allegedly in 2011 warrant the application of
three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC ¶¶ 19(a), “inability to
satisfy debts”; 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and 19(f), “failure to
file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to
pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.”
Applicant’s admitted bankruptcy petitions and student loan delinquency negate
the need for any independent proof. See McCormick on Evidence, § 262 (6th ed. 2006).
Each of Applicant’s admitted bankruptcy filings and delinquent student loan debt are
fully documented and create some judgment issues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3
(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). 
Financial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required
precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that
entitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security
clearance holder’s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and
influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt
delinquencies.  
Historically, the incurring of delinquent debts and timing of filing federal tax
returns and resolving federal tax delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an
applicant’s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and
guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a
sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR
Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant’s cited extenuating
circumstances associated with his three Chapter 13 petitions (inclusive of the 1995
petition that was converted to a Chapter 7 petition and ultimately discharged) provide
some grounds for crediting him with extenuating circumstances. Based on his cited
circumstances, MC ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual
acted responsibly under the circumstances,” partially applies to Applicant’s situation.
To his credit, Applicant fulfilled the conditions established by the courts
considering his 1995 Chapter 13 petition (converted to a Chapter 7 petition the same
year),  and he is in full compliance with the installment agreements he completed with
his son’s student loan lender and the IRS relative to his late filed 2009 federal tax
return. 
Applicant’s untimely filings of his 2009 and 2012 federal tax returns are well-
documented. Both his 2009 and 2012 tax returns were late: one month late for his 2009
tax return and two months late for his 2012 return. Late filing penalties were imposed in
both instances. So, the record is a little mixed with respect to Applicant’s timing of his
tax filings between 2009 and 2015.
8
Based on both the age and prior discharges of Applicant’s past bankruptcies and
his demonstrated compliance with the installment agreements he completed with SOR
creditor ¶ 1.d and the IRS concerning SOR creditor ¶ 1.e, he  may claim the mitigation
benefits of the “acting responsibly” prong of  MC ¶ 20(b), as well as the benefits of other
applicable mitigating conditions.  MC ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated and is adhering to
a  good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” is fully
applicable.  See ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017); ISCR Case
No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4
(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). 
By establishing his compliance with the terms of his 2011 IRS installment
agreement, Applicant is also entitled to the full mitigating benefits of MC ¶ 20(g), “the
individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the
amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.” See ISCR Case No. 16-
02246, at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). 
Because of the age and limited nature of the on-line counseling he received as
conditions of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings, MC ¶ 20(c), “the individual has received
or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible
source, such as a non-profit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the
problem is being resolved or is under control,” while potentially applicable, has very
limited mitigation benefit to Applicant.  None of the other potentially applicable mitigating
conditions are available to Applicant.  
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance
of a “meaningful track record” that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely filing of tax
returns. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)  In Applicant’s case,
his reported  untimely filing of his 2009 federal return was implicitly approved by the IRS
in the 2011 installment agreement he completed and fulfilled. Favorable to Applicant,
too, are the credited timely filings of his 2010-2011 and 2013-2015 federal tax returns. 
Summarized, Applicant’s case is clearly distinguishable from the facts and
circumstances covered in ISCR Case No. 15-06440, supra, at 4-5.
Whole-Person Assessment
In making a whole-person assessment of Applicant’s trustworthiness, reliability,
and good judgment, consideration is given to not only the financial issues raised in the
SOR, but the contributions he has made to his employer, his military service, and the
defense industry in general.  
Applicant’s supervisors credit him with displaying exceptional leadership and
moral character. They commended him for not only his significant contributions as a
9
supervisor and mentor, but for his all around trustworthiness and reliability. His
performance evaluations are superior and reflect consistent credits for his demonstrated
personal integrity, honesty, and conduct throughout every category of his job appraisal.
To Applicant’s credit, too, are the numerous awards and citations he earned during his
21 years of military service in the AF.   
Favorable credit is also warranted for the corrective steps Applicant has taken
with his creditors. Each of his bankruptcy petitions resulted in either discharges or a
successful conversion to Chapter 7 that ultimately was discharged. Installment
agreements in place with Applicant’s student loan lender and IRS credit Applicant with
compliance.     
Overall, Applicant’s actions to date in addressing his finances are promising  and
enable him to overcome any reasonable doubts about his trustworthiness, reliability,
and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. Conclusions are warranted
that his finances are sufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility
requirements for holding a security clearance. 
Favorable conclusions are warranted with respect to SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e.  Criteria for
satisfying the eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance are satisfied.   
Formal Findings
In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I
make the following formal findings:
GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): FOR APPLICANT
   
             Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:                          For Applicant
 Conclusions
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to hold a
security clearance. Clearance is granted.
