APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
10, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E
(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended)
(Directive).  Applicant requested a decision on the written record.  On October 25, 2017, after
considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge
David M. White denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant
to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant did not respond to the File of Relevant Material, and his appeal brief asserts no
harmful error by the Judge.  Rather, it contains new evidence about his debts, which we cannot
consider.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29.  Moreover, his brief does not challenge the Judge’s adverse findings
under Guideline E.  Our authority to review a case is limited to those in which the appealing party
has raised an issue of harmful error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08349 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2017).
