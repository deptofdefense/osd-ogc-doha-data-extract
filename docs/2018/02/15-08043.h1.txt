Decision 
___________ 
 
TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (financial 
considerations). Clearance is denied.      
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On January 26, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Position (SF-86). On May 12, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a SOR to Applicant under Executive 
Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 
20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 
2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial 
considerations).

On June 22, 2016, Applicant provided a response to the SOR. On June 30, 2016, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On June 8, 2017, the case was assigned to 
me. On June 26, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing, setting the hearing for August 15, 2017. Applicant’s hearing was held 
as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered 
one exhibit; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 15-17; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) On August 23, 2017, 
DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing. The record was held open until 
September 29, 2017, to permit Applicant to submit additional documentation. (Tr. 54, 63) 
Applicant provided nine post-hearing exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (AE 
B-AE J) 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), which are applicable to all 
covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 
2006 AGs and are effective on June 8, 2017. I have evaluated Applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 
 
Procedural Issue 
 
Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add SOR ¶ 1.e alleging that 
Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 54, 
58) Department Counsel also moved to add SOR ¶ 1.f alleging that Applicant failed to file 
his state income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 59-60) Applicant did not 
object, and the motion to amend the SOR was granted. (Tr. 60) 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b. HE 3. 
His SOR response also provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions 
are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 44-years-old, and he has been employed with a DOD contractor as a 
supply technician since January 2015. (Tr. 17-18) He does not have a security clearance. 
(Tr. 18) His current position requires a security clearance. (Tr. 19) In 1991, he graduated 
from high school. (Tr. 19) He has not attended college. (Tr. 19-20) In 2006, he married. 
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/5220-6 R20170608.pdf.  
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 
                                         
 
(Tr. 20) He has one step-child who is 36. (Tr. 20-21) His spouse is employed full-time 
outside his home. (Tr. 20)  He has not served in the U.S. armed forces. (Tr. 21)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR details the following allegations, and their status is as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that in September 2011, a judgment was filed against Applicant 
for $1,930. Applicant leased a vehicle for his spouse. (Tr. 26) In 2011, the creditor claimed 
wear and tear to the vehicle and obtained a judgment for $1,930. The creditor received 
payment through garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and the creditor wrote on February 
20, 2014 that the debt was paid in full. (Tr. 26, 52; SOR response)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that in November 2011, a state tax lien was filed against 
Applicant for $625 for real estate taxes. The house with the lien is in his spouse’s name, 
and the state tax lien is not Applicant’s debt. (Tr. 27-29) Applicant said he paid the state 
tax authority $225, and he plans to pay $225 for three months, which will resolve his 
spouse’s real estate debt. (Tr. 27-30) The June 22, 2016 installment agreement Applicant 
submitted to address this lien indicates the debt is for $894. (SOR response) Department 
Counsel requested, and the record was held open, to permit Applicant to provide updated 
status of his state tax debt. (Tr. 30, 54) He did not provide any post-hearing information 
about this debt. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax 
years 2012, 2013, and 2014. Applicant filed the tax returns for tax years 2012 (owes $684) 
and 2013 (refund $1,471) in July 2015, and he filed his federal income tax return for tax 
year 2014 (refund $1,388) in the winter of 2015. (Tr. 10, 38-39, 41; SOR response). He 
said his spouse takes care of the family tax returns, and she was under the impression 
that it was unnecessary to file timely their tax returns. (Tr. 33-34) His family was distracted 
from filing tax returns when his brother, mother-in-law, and mother suffered serious 
illnesses. (Tr. 34-35) His brother passed away from cancer. His spouse was exhausted 
from working 12-hour shifts. (Tr. 34-35, 47) Applicant was underemployed. For example, 
around 2011 Applicant was earning $11.50 an hour and later he was making $12.86 an 
hour. His spouse had four periods of unemployment. (Tr. 35-36, 47) In 2012 and 2013, 
he thought a volunteer at the library filed his tax returns; however, they were not actually 
filed. (Tr. 37)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant owes federal income taxes totaling $4,400 for tax 
years 2012 and 2013. On August 11, 2014, the IRS wrote that Applicant owed $4,426 for 
tax years 2009, 2010, and 2014, and the IRS assessed the debt as uncollectable. (Tr. 32; 
SOR response) The August 11, 2014 IRS letter did not provide a year-by-year breakdown 
on the taxes owed for each tax year. On April 31, 2015, the IRS wrote that Applicant 
overpaid his taxes $1,471 for tax year 2013, and $1,109 was applied to his debt for tax 
year 2010, and $361 was applied to his debt for tax year 2009. (AE A) He still owed $367 
to the IRS. (Tr. 31; AE A) Department Counsel requested that Applicant provide tax 
transcripts. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant asserted he owed the IRS less than $500. (Tr. 33) 
Department Counsel requested updated information on the status of this debt. (Tr. 55) 
 
4 
                                         
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax 
years 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 43-44, 58) SOR ¶ 1.f alleges he failed to file his state income 
tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. (AE B) As of the date of his hearing, he had not 
filed his federal and state income tax returns for those tax years. (Tr. 44) He blamed the 
failure to file his tax return for tax year 2015 on the delay in obtaining a security clearance 
and “a boss that was actively trying to fire [him] over it.” (Tr. 43) He eventually conceded 
his problems at work and the delay in approval of his security clearance did not cause 
him not to timely file his tax returns. (Tr. 44) In September 2017, Applicant filed his federal 
and state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016, and he is “getting some refunds in 
these tax returns.” (AE F; AE J) He said in the future, he plans to file his tax returns 
separately from his spouse to ensure his tax returns are timely filed. (Tr. 38, 47, 57)   
 
After Applicant’s hearing, he provided additional evidence about his state income 
taxes. On unspecified dates, he paid the following amounts to the state tax authority: $84 
for tax year 2012; $101 for tax year 2013; $1,361 for tax year 2014; and $4 for tax year 
2015. (AE B-AE E) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
A police officer with more than 20 years of law enforcement experience, a retired 
Navy chief petty officer, and a retired Army colonel have known Applicant for many years. 
The general sense of their letters is that Applicant is diligent, trustworthy, and honest. 
Their statements support approval of his security clearance. (AE G; AE H; AE I) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
  
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
 
5 
                                         
 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 
6 
                                         
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(c) a history of not 
meeting financial obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required.” The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), 
and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
 Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;4   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant and his spouse’s unemployment, underemployment, and family illnesses 
were partially or fully outside his control and adversely affected his finances. However, 
he did not establish that he acted prudently and responsibly under the circumstances. His 
                                            
4 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
failures to ensure his federal and state income tax returns were timely filed showed poor 
judgment.  
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance and commented as follows: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to [comply 
with tax laws], Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good 
judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified 
information.  
 
Applicant is credited with mitigating SOR ¶ 1.a. On February 20, 2014, the 
creditor received payment through garnishment of Applicant’s wages. The debt in 
SOR ¶ 1.b is mitigated because it is his spouse’s debt. SOR ¶ 1.c is partially 
mitigated because Appellant filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012, 
2013, and 2014 in July 2015, which was before the SOR was issued.  
 
The main problem here is Applicant’s failure to timely file his state and federal tax 
returns for tax years 2012 through 2016. For some of these years, he was entitled to a 
refund, or the taxes due were low. For the first three years, he relied on his spouse to file 
their tax returns. For 2015 and 2016, he filed the tax returns after his hearing. He did not 
provide documentation showing the specific amount of federal taxes due. His failure to 
file his tax returns timely several years ago is somewhat excused due to his 
underemployment, lack of education, financial inexperience, misplaced trust in a tax 
volunteer, and illnesses in his family. There is insufficient assurance his financial 
problems are resolved, under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the 
circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security 
concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
9 
                                         
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 44-years-old, and he has been employed with a DOD contractor as a 
supply technician since January 2015. In 1991, he graduated from high school. He has 
not attended college. His spouse is employed full-time outside his home. Several 
circumstances beyond his control harmed his finances and distracted him and his spouse 
from timely filing their federal and state tax returns for several years. 
 
A police officer, a retired Navy chief petty officer, and a retired Army colonel have 
known Applicant for many years and describe him as diligent, trustworthy, and honest. 
Their statements support approval of his security clearance.  
 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is substantial. Applicant filed 
his federal tax returns late for tax years 2012 through 2016. He filed his state tax returns 
late for 2015 and 2016. He did not provide documentation showing the current status of 
his federal tax debt. His actions raise unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 
10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the 
whole person. Financial consideration security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance 
eligibility at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f:  Against Applicant 
 
  
 
10 
                                         
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.
