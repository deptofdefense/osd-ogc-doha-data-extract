Decision

MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised 
by his financial situation. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 28, 2016, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under the financial 
considerations guideline. Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the 
administrative (written) record. 
 
 On February 10, 2017, Department Counsel sent Applicant a file of relevant 
material (FORM). With the FORM, Department Counsel forwarded to Applicant five 
exhibits, pre-marked Items 1 – 5, which the Government offers for admission into the 
record. Applicant received the FORM on February 23, 2017. (Appellate Exhibit I.) He was 
given 30 days to raise any objection to the material offered by Department Counsel and 
submit evidence in support of his case. He did not file any objections or submit a 
response. Without objection, Items 1 – 5 are admitted into the record.  
 
 On November 3, 2017, I was assigned the matter for decision. After receiving 
written confirmation that Applicant remains sponsored for a security clearance (Appellate 
 
2 
Exhibit II), I reopened the record to allow both sides to supply updated information. 
(Appellate Exhibit III.) Applicant submitted a number of documents that were collectively 
marked Item 6 and are admitted into the record without objection. The record closed on 
November 20, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 35-year-old married father of three. He graduated from high school 
in 2001 and enlisted in the U.S. military. He served on active duty from 2001 to 2006, and 
then began working for a large defense contractor. Applicant was laid off by his former 
employer in 2010. Since then, he has experienced several periods of unemployment.1   
 
After being laid off in 2010, Applicant attended a technical college to improve his 
job prospects. He earned an associate’s degree in 2012. He was hired by his current 
employer in approximately January 2015. He started the new job in March 2016, but 
experienced another period of short-term unemployment from July to September 2017. 
He has received good performance evaluations and has a good reputation at his new 
place of employment for his punctuality, trustworthiness, and reliability. He is seen as a 
team player who places the mission of his employer and the U.S. Government client first. 
He has deployed in support of the client’s mission.2  
 
In January 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application in 
connection with his current job. He reported having accumulated delinquent debt due to 
unemployment. During a security clearance interview in July 2016, Applicant discussed 
his past-due debts, including the 13 debts totaling about $33,000 listed on the SOR. He 
explained to the security clearance investigator that following the layoff in 2010 he was 
able to keep pace with his bills for a time, but then began falling further and further behind. 
He lost his home to foreclosure and was unable to pay his credit cards and other debts.3  
 
Applicant has resolved 5 of the 13 SOR debts. The five resolved debts total less 
than $1,500.4 Applicant provided a 1099-A form relating to the 2010 foreclosure of his 
former home. The 1099-A reflects that the fair market value of the home at the time the 
lender acquired it was $111,000, but the outstanding mortgage balance was 
approximately $125,000.5  
 
Applicant has not addressed the remaining eight SOR debts, which total over 
$30,000.6 Recent credit reports reflect no new negative entries and show that Applicant 
                                                          
1 Specifically, he was unemployed from March 2010 to December 2011, October 2013 to January 2014, 
and November 2014 to January 2015. Items 1 – 3, 6. 
 
2 Items 2, 3, 6.B. 
 
3 Items 2 and 3. 
 
4 Specifically, Applicant provided sufficient evidence showing he satisfied the debts listed at SOR 1.c, 1.d, 
1.k – 1.m. (Item 6.C, Item 6.D, and Item 6.L at 78.) 
 
5 Item 6.H. 
 
6 Item 1 (in answer admits all SOR debts), Item 6. 
 
3 
is paying his current debts as agreed.7 A November 2017 credit report, however, points 
to potential financial trouble on the horizon. Notably, the report reflects that the 
outstanding balance on one of Applicant’s credit card accounts has risen in 11 months 
from $1,600 in January 2017 to nearly $6,000 in November 2017.8 Applicant has not 
obtained financial or credit counseling.9  
 
Law, Policies, and Regulations 
 
This case is decided under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which 
became effective on June 8, 2017. ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 
2003) (security clearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards). 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Instead, persons are only eligible for access to classified 
information “upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest” to 
authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative 
judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The 
guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human 
behavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, 
considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial 
decision. AG ¶ 2. 
 
Department Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged 
in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting “witnesses and 
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable 
clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
Administrative Judges must remain fair and impartial, and carefully balance the 
needs for the expedient resolution of a case with the demands of due process. Therefore, 
an administrative judge will ensure that an applicant: (a) receives fair notice of the issues, 
(b) has a reasonable opportunity to address those issues, and (c) is not subjected to unfair 
surprise. Directive, ¶ E3.1.10; ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). 
 
                                                          
7 Item 6.L – Item 6.M. Applicant’s October 2017 credit report states that past judgments and liens would 
generally not be reported on a credit report seven and ten years, respectively, after they were filed. (Item 
6.L at 77.) Applicant told the security clearance investigator that he incurred the majority of the delinquent 
debts listed on the SOR in approximately 2010, and the 1099-A confirms that his former home was 
foreclosed in 2010. (Item 3; Item 6.H.) 
 
8 Item 6.N. 
 
9 Item 6. 
 
4 
In evaluating the evidence, a judge applies a “substantial evidence” standard, 
which is something less than a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, substantial 
evidence is defined as “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.” 
Directive, ¶ E3.1.32.1.10 
 
Any doubt raised by the evidence must be resolved in favor of the national security. 
AG ¶ 2(b). See also Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), ¶ E.4. Additionally, 
the Supreme Court has held that responsible officials making “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and 
confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain 
degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of 
compromise of classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. (AG ¶ 18.) 
 
The security concern here is not limited to a consideration of whether a person 
with financial issues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in 
other illegality to pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances 
giving rise to delinquent debt cast doubt upon a person’s judgment, self-control, and other 
qualities essential to protecting classified information. See generally ISCR Case No. 11-
05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
In assessing Applicant’s case, I considered the applicable disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, including: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
                                                          
10 However, a judge’s mere disbelief of an applicant’s testimony, without actual evidence of disqualifying 
conduct or admission by an applicant to the disqualifying conduct, is not enough to sustain an unfavorable 
finding. ISCR Case No. 15-05565 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2017); ISCR Case No. 02-24452 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2004). Furthermore, an unfavorable decision cannot be based on non-alleged conduct. ISCR Case No. 14-
05986 (App. Bd. May 26, 2017). Unless an applicant is provided notice that unalleged conduct raises a 
security concern, it can only be used for specific limited purposes, such as assessing mitigation and 
credibility. ISCR Case No. 16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017). 
 
5 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control . . . and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem . . . and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d):  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Persons applying for a security clearance are not required to be debt free, or have 
unblemished financial records, or a certain credit score. However, they are expected to 
present evidence explaining the circumstances leading to their financial issues and 
mitigating security concerns raised by such issues. Moreover, they bear the burden of 
showing that they manage their personal finances in a manner consistent with the 
expectations for those granted access to classified information.11 
 
Applicant failed to meet his burden of proof and persuasion. His financial problems 
appear to be largely attributable to periods of unemployment from 2010 to the present. 
He has addressed a few minor debts listed on the SOR, but I am unable to extend full 
consideration of AG ¶ 20(b) and the other mitigating conditions in his favor because he 
has yet to address over $30,000 in delinquent debt. He has been aware of the security 
concerns raised by his delinquent debt for some time and has yet to take action to address 
the vast majority of them. Furthermore, Applicant has not obtained financial counseling 
and a recent credit report suggests the possibility of additional financial issues in the not 
too distant future. Accordingly, the disqualifying conditions listed at AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(c) 
apply and the favorable evidence is not sufficient to outweigh the security concerns at 
issue. Applicant’s financial situation remains a security concern.12 
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e-1.j:       Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.k – 1.m:       For Applicant 
                                                          
11 ISCR Case 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008). See also ISCR Case No. 15-02585 at 2 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2016) (“It is reasonable for Judges to expect applicants to present documentation about the 
satisfaction of individual debts.”)  
 
12 In reaching this adverse decision, I considered the whole-person concept, including Applicant’s military 
service, favorable employment record, and reference letters. See generally AG ¶ 2. However, this and the 
other favorable record evidence are insufficient to mitigate concerns raised by his financial situation.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant Applicant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.13

13 I considered the exceptions listed in SEAD 4, Appendix C. Applicant’s debt resolution efforts to date, 
candor during the security clearance process, and the other favorable record evidence support extending 
a conditional clearance. However, insufficient evidence was submitted to allow me to find that the imposition 
of additional security measures would sufficiently address the security concerns at issue. Notably, Applicant 
failed to show that he is: (a) addressing the remaining SOR debts, (b) receiving financial or credit 
counseling, and (c) currently living within his means. The record is also silent as to whether Applicant’s 
employer is willing to monitor his compliance with any such security measures or conditions and report to 
the Government if he fails to do so. Accordingly, a conditional clearance is not warranted.
