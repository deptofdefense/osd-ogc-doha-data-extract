LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to revoke her eligibility for 
access to classified information. Her tax problems were due to the circumstances 
largely beyond her control; namely, her husband’s negligence coupled with his deceit to 
her over many years. These circumstances also resulted in the dissolution of their 
longtime marriage. Since discovering the full extent of the tax problems, she took action 
to remedy the situation and has filed returns and paid the amounts owed to both the IRS 
and the state tax authority. She is now in compliance with both the IRS and the state tax 
authority. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations,

on November 9, 2015.2 This document is commonly known as a security clearance 
application. Thereafter, on July 15, 2017, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement 
of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is 
similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security 
guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   
 
Applicant answered the SOR on August 18, 2017. She admitted the allegations 
in the SOR; she provided a one-page memorandum in explanation; and she requested 
a hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on October 5, 2017. The hearing took place as 
scheduled on April 11, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel 
offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6. A ruling 
on Exhibit 2 was held in abeyance pending Applicant’s post-hearing response.  
Applicant’s documentary exhibits were admitted as Exhibits A-H. No witnesses were 
called other than Applicant.  
 
The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. She 
made a timely submission on June 4, 2018, as follows: (1) Exhibit I, cover letter in 
explanation; (2) Exhibit J, certificate of compliance and letter of good standing from the 
state tax authority, dated May 24, 2018; and (3) Exhibit K, IRS account transcript for tax 
year 2015, dated May 30, 2018. Those matters are admitted without objections. In 
addition, Applicant indicated in Exhibit I that she did in fact object to Government Exhibit 
2, an unauthenticated report of investigation prepared during the course of her 2016 
background investigation. Accordingly, her objection is sustained, Exhibit 2 is not 
admitted, and I have not considered it.  
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance 
that she has held for many years. She is employed as a senior configuration analyst for 
a large company in the defense industry. She has worked for the same company (or its 
predecessor in interest) since 1990. She has a good employment record, to include 
working in classified settings.3 Her formal education includes a high school diploma and 
some college. She married in 1985, when she was 20 years old. She now has three 
adult children, ages 33, 30, and 19, all of whom have served in the U.S. armed forces, 
and her youngest child is currently serving on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps.4 
She met her now former husband when she was 15 years old, she described both their

families as very traditional, and she ran their marital home accordingly. In addition to a 
full-time job, she managed the children and the household. He was responsible for their 
financial matters, and she had no reason not to trust him to do so. As noted above, 
Applicant and her husband divorced in June 2017 after more than three decades of 
marriage. 
 
Applicant does not dispute the tax problems, although having financial problems 
or difficulties was not a common occurrence over the years. A credit report obtained 
during her 2005 background investigation shows no indications of financial distress or 
irresponsibility.5 The credit report includes 29 accounts, all of which are listed as “pays 
as agreed,” 17 accounts have a balance of $0, and a single account was previously 30 
days past due on two occasions.  
 
 In her November 2015 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that 
she and her then husband failed to file federal and state income tax returns for tax years 
2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, and she estimated owing $5,000 for each of those 
years.6 She also indicated that they were working with a tax accountant to remedy the 
situation. Accordingly, the SOR relied on those disclosures to allege (1) a failure to 
timely pay income tax and to timely file federal and state returns for tax years 2010-
2014, and (2) that she was indebted to the IRS “and/or” the state tax authority in the 
amount of about $25,000 for tax years 2010-2014, which remained unpaid.7 
 
At hearing, Applicant explained that she initially learned about the tax problems 
in November 2015, when she asked her then husband questions about their financial 
record in order to complete the security clearance application.8 His response to her was 
“don’t worry, I’m taking care of it. That was his response. Don’t worry, I’m taking care of 
it. That was always his response to me. And like I said, I had no reason to doubt him.”9  
 
Learning the full extent of the tax problems was a slow and difficult process for 
Applicant, because her husband was slow to provide relevant information, and she did 
not even know the name of their accountant. Her learning curve was also complicated 
by the fact that their family finances were handled by accounting at her husband’s 
business. She learned more details during her 2016 background investigation,

7 According to A Dictionary of Modern American Usage 40 (Bryan A. Garner, Oxford University Press, 
1998), the term and/or is both outdated and ambiguous. A “legal and business expression dating from the 
mid-19th century, and/or has been vilified for most of its life—and rightly so. To avoid ambiguity, don’t use 
it. Many writers—especially lawyers—would be surprised at how easy and workable this solution is. Or 
alone usually suffices.” The slash is problematic in legal writing because it is inherently ambiguous; its 
function may be conjunctive or disjunctive, the reader is left to figure it out. Use of the slash (for example, 
and/or and he/she) in a formal document such as an SOR is highly discouraged.

describing herself as “shocked.”10 It was in approximately mid-2016 or early 2017 when 
she had a good understanding of the situation and starting taking action to resolve the 
tax problems.11  
 
As Applicant learned more and realized the level of her husband’s deceit, the 
marriage deteriorated. While working on addressing the tax problems, she was also in 
the process of divorcing her husband, which resulted in selling the marital home they 
had owned since 2003. In addition, Applicant became seriously ill, on the verge of renal 
failure, and her employer required her to go on disability for about four and a half 
months in 2017.12 To date, Applicant does not fully understand why her former husband 
neglected their tax obligations, although she thinks it was probably due to a combination 
of business problems and his irresponsibility and inattention to the paperwork aspect of 
running his business.13 
 
Applicant has filed returns and paid the amounts owed to both the IRS and the 
state tax authority for tax years 2010-2014.14 To start, she presented a May 2018 
certificate of compliance showing she is in good standing with her state tax authority, 
which means she has filed all returns and paid all taxes due.15 She was able to pay the 
back taxes by using the proceeds of the sale of the marital home, which was a condition 
or term of the divorce decree.16 In particular, the marital home was sold for about 
$285,000 in April 2017. Applicant and her husband entered into a holdback agreement 
wherein the sum of about $85,000 was held by a title company and then disbursed for 
payment of back taxes pursuant to the divorce decree. Payments of $4,644, $3,582, 
$9,848, and $14,517 were made to the IRS for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, 
respectively, in mid-May 2017, which was before the SOR was issued.17 And payments 
of $1,331, $3,249, $2,310, $5,421, $6,355, and $32,312 were made to the IRS for tax 
years 2008, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively, in early September 2017, 
which was shortly after the SOR was issued. Altogether, the payments total about 
$83,569.  
 
Concerning the filing of returns, IRS account transcripts establish the filing of all 
required returns for tax years 2008 through 2016, and the balance due for those tax

years is $0.18 The relevant details on filing are as follows: (1) for tax year 2008, a 
substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in May 2010; (2) for 2009, a return was 
filed in late July 2017; (3) for 2010, a substitute tax return was prepared by the IRS in 
February 2013; (4) for 2011, a return was filed in late July 2017; (5) for 2012, a return 
was filed in late July 2017; (6) for 2013, a return was filed in late July 2017; (7) for 2014, 
a return was filed in early July 2017; (8) for 2015, a return was filed in early October 
2017; and (9) for 2016, a return was filed in early October 2017. At the hearing in April 
2018, Applicant was in the process of working with her accountant to finalize filing 
returns and pay taxes due for tax year 2017, and she intended to meet the filing 
deadline later that month.19 Applicant is no longer intertwined with former husband’s 
business. She will file separate or individual 2017 state and federal income tax returns 
based on income received by her, and her former husband is obliged to do the same 
per the divorce decree.20 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.21 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.22 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”23 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.24 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.25

 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.26 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.27 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.28 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.29 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.30 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.31 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . .32 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive 
information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;

29 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14. 
 
30 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
31 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
32 AG ¶ 18. 
 
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income 
tax as required;  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity 
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and   
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.   
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of tax problems 
that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The two disqualifying 
conditions noted above apply to this case. In reaching this conclusion, I considered that 
the failure to file tax returns or pay tax when due (or both) bears close examination and 
is a matter of serious concern to the federal government.33 The nexus or security 
significance between an applicant’s tax problems and their eligibility for access to 
classified information was explained by the Appeal Board as follows: 
 
Security requirements include consideration of a person’s judgment, 
reliability, and a sense of [their] legal obligations. Failure to comply with 
federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem 
with abiding by well-established government rules and regulations. 
Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting 
classified information.34  
 
In other words, failure to timely file income tax returns or pay tax when due is serious 
business, and it is viewed with enhanced scrutiny. 
 
 Concerning mitigating conditions, Applicant receives credit under AG ¶ 20(b) 
because the tax problems were caused by her husband’s negligence and his deceit in 
concealing their tax problems from her over many years. Plainly, this is a circumstance 
largely beyond her control. And I am persuaded that she acted like a reasonable person 
who was confronting a difficult situation, which was not limited to financial matters. 
Learning about the full extent of the tax problems and then taking action to address the 
situation coincided with the dissolution of a long-time marriage, the sale of the marital 
home owned since 2003, and a serious illness, which resulted in her being placed into a 
disability status at work for four and a half months in 2017. Taking these circumstances 
                                                          
33 The General Accountability Office (GAO) expressed serious concern over the relationship between tax 
delinquents and clearance holders in its July 28, 2014 report, Security Clearances: Tax Debts Owed by 
DOD Employees and Contractors, http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665052.pdf.

together, Applicant has done a remarkable job in resolving very difficult tax problems, 
which were not of her own making.   
 
  AG ¶ 20(g) is also applicable in Applicant’s favor. She presented reliable 
documentation showing that the past-due returns were filed, the back taxes were paid, 
and that she is now in compliance with the IRS and the state tax authority. I note that in 
applying this mitigating condition, the length of noncompliance as well as the timing and 
length of compliance are questions of fact to consider and weigh. The length of 
noncompliance here is long, but its significance is lessened because Applicant was 
unaware of the tax problems until late 2015, and she did not fully understand the extent 
of the tax problems until about mid-2016 at the earliest. Concerning compliance, as 
noted above, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances and was working on 
the tax problems well before the SOR was issued in July 2017. By then, she had 
already sold the marital home in April 2017, made multiple payments to the IRS in May 
2017, and divorced her husband in June 2017. The federal returns were filed shortly 
thereafter in July and October 2017 many months before the hearing in this case. Given 
these circumstances, the timing and length of compliance do not undermine her case in 
mitigation.  
 
 In addition to the formal mitigating circumstances, I have considered the totality 
of the evidence, to include the fact that Applicant has successfully worked in the 
defense industry since 1990, about 28 years, and had a security clearance for decades. 
I considered that the tax problems, which were caused by her former husband’s 
negligence and deceit, were situational in nature and occurred over the course of an 
otherwise successful career. I also considered that recurrence of similar financial 
problems is unlikely because she is no longer intertwined with her former husband’s 
business, and their marriage ended in June 2017. Having considered all these matters, I 
am wholly satisfied that Applicant is an acceptable security risk within the meaning of 
our adjudicative process.35 
 
 Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or 
concerns about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the 
evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I 
conclude that she has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified 
information.
