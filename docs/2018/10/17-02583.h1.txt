Decision

DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems, including bankruptcies, failing to 
timely file Federal tax returns, and unpaid Federal and state income taxes. He did not 
mitigate the resulting financial security concerns. National security eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On December 19, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial 
Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility 
for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.

 Applicant answered the SOR in writing on January 25, 2018, and requested that 
his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing 
(Answer). On March 23, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government’s written 
case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing 13 Items, was 
mailed to Applicant on March 27, 2018, and received by him on April 16, 2018. The FORM 
notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in 
refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant 
timely submitted a response to the FORM, which included his letter and attachments. I 
marked that exhibit Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. In his response, he did not object to the 
Government’s Items. Department Counsel did not object to Applicant’s exhibit. Items 1 
through 13, and AE A are admitted into evidence. DOHA assigned the case to me on July 
30, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the eight allegations contained in the SOR. He provided some 
explanations. (Item 1) 
 
 Applicant is 56 years old and married to his second wife for many years. He has 
three adult children. He has held a security clearance for 18 years while working for 
defense contractors. In June 2014, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaires for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In it he disclosed a 2008 mortgage problem and a 
2008 automobile repossession. During an August 2014 interview with a government 
investigator, he attributed those problems to the loss of his wife’s income around that 
time. (Item 1, Item 2, Item 3) 
 
 In April 2017, a government investigator interviewed Applicant to further discuss 
his finances. He said he relinquished his home to the bank and the car to the dealer, and 
had no further financial obligation for either. He discussed his tax audits, late income tax 
filings, unpaid Federal and state taxes, delinquent retail debts, and bankruptcies. (Item 5) 
 
  In December 2015, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (SOR ¶ 1.a) The 
bankruptcy included payments to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for unpaid Federal 
and state taxes as noted below, and other debts. Applicant made monthly payments of 
$4,500 into the trustee’s plan from January 2016 to August 2016. After Applicant’s lawyer 
appealed for a reduction of that payment amount, the bankruptcy was dismissed. (Item 
5; AE A) 
 
 In October 2016, Applicant filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy. That proceeding 
remains active. (SOR ¶ 1.b) The total amount of claims included in the bankruptcy was 
$286,812. His Federal and state tax liability was over $177,000. Applicant has been 
making monthly payments of $2,835 since November 2016. (Item 4)  
 
 In 2010, Applicant was audited by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax years 
2006 and 2007. The IRS found that Applicant and his wife owed $129,000 for unpaid 
taxes, interest and penalties for those years. (SOR ¶ 1.c) Applicant attributed the debt to 
 
 
 
 
3 
his wife’s business and a tax preparer’s errors on their returns. This debt is being paid 
through Applicant’s Chapter 13 bankruptcy. As of May 2017, the balance on his Federal 
tax debt for 2006 and 2007 was $22,955. (AE A)  
 
 Applicant failed to timely file Federal tax returns for years 2010 through 2016. 
(SOR ¶ 1.d) Based on IRS transcripts, Applicant filed his 2010 return in May 2012. He 
filed his 2011 return in June 2013; 2012 return in March 2014; 2013 return in April 2015; 
2014 return in February 2016; and 2015 return in February 2017. He said he filed the 
returns late because his wife worked for a family business and did not receive the 
necessary documents on time. He timely filed his 2016 and 2017 Federal tax returns. 
(Item 5; AE A) 
 
 Applicant owes the IRS $15,700 for tax year 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.e) This amount is 
included in the 2016 Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Item 5) 
 
 Applicant owes the IRS $14,000 for unpaid taxes for tax year 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.f) In 
his Answer, he stated the IRS recommended that payments be included in his bankruptcy 
plan. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether it is included or being resolved. 
(Item 1) 
 
 Applicant stated that he owes the IRS $12,224 for tax year 2017. He also owes 
state taxes of $3,499 for that year.1 As of May 2018, that tax debt is not being resolved. 
(AE A) 
 
  Applicant owes his state $2,300 for unpaid taxes for tax year 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.g) 
That amount is included in the 2016 Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He said his current state tax 
liability for all years through 2015 was $3,341. (Item 5) 
 
 Applicant owes his state $3,088 for unpaid taxes for tax year 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.h) 
As of May 2018, that tax is not being resolved. (Item 1; AE A) 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for national security eligibility, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which 
are useful in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
                                            
1I have not considered for disqualifying purposes any derogatory information that was not alleged in the 
SOR. I may consider the information when making a credibility determination, in applying the mitigating 
conditions, and in analyzing the whole-person concept.  
 
 
 
 
 
4 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture. 
 
Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 states that an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as 
to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  
 
Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be “in 
terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of 
the applicant concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
The security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set 
out in AG & 18:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to 
protect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or 
exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of 
 
 
 
 
5 
personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health 
conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security 
concerns. Two are potentially applicable in this case: 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns for 2010 through 2015. He 
is making payments to both the IRS and his state for unpaid taxes for some of those 
years. He is also making payments for Federal and state taxes owed for tax years 2006 
and 2007. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. 
 
After the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying 
conditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of 
the security concerns. AG ¶ 20 sets out three conditions that could potentially mitigate 
financial security concerns under this guideline: 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Applicant did not timely file Federal tax returns from 2010 to 2015. His failure to 
timely file for six years casts doubt on his current judgment and reliability. He continues 
to make payments to the bankruptcy court for unpaid Federal and state tax liabilities. He 
has not resolved or paid his 2016 and 2017 Federal and state tax liabilities. The fact that 
he timely filed tax returns for 2016 and 2017 is insufficient to outweigh his history of not 
timely filing Federal returns. AG ¶ 20(a) minimally applies.  
 
Applicant did not provide a legitimate explanation for failing to timely file six years 
of Federal tax returns. He failed to establish mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b). There is 
 
 
 
 
6 
evidence that he has been making payments through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on his 
delinquent tax debts since January 2016; however, there is no evidence that he is 
resolving his 2016 or 2017 tax debts. He established some evidence under AG ¶ 20(g).  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and 
other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) 
the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility 
must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
guidelines and the whole-person concept. 
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 56-year-old man who has worked for defense contractors for a 
number of years. During several of those years, he failed to resolve a large amount of 
delinquent debts and taxes, resulting in his filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2015 and 
again in 2016. Although he has been making progress in addressing some unpaid Federal 
and state taxes, along with other debts, he has not sufficiently established a track record 
of responsibly managing his finances. His 2016 and 2017 tax debts remain unpaid.  
Applicant’s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to file tax returns 
and timely pay tax debts is concerning. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with these things is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). 
Someone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of 
those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 
14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant

Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), 
aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).2  
   
The record evidence leaves me with doubt as to Applicant’s judgment and 
suitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns 
arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:        AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:      Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. 
National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
