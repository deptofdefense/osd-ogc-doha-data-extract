Decision

LOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant refuted the personal conduct security concerns, but he did not mitigate 
the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 26, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal 
conduct) and F (financial considerations). Applicant responded to the SOR on January 
15, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on March 9, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 27, 2018, scheduling the 
hearing for June 18, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted 
without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional 
 
2 
 
information. He submitted documents that I have marked AE F through I and admitted 
without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for 
his current employer since 2015. He is married with three adult children.1 
 
 Applicant and a partner worked as private contractors for a company from about 
2005 until they lost the contract due to a merger in 2011. He worked for another 
company for about a year until he accepted a job with a defense contractor in January 
2013. He worked in Afghanistan from about January 2013 through June 2013, when the 
company lost its contract. He worked for a temporary agency and another company 
before he was hired by his current employer in January 2015. He worked in Kuwait from 
2015 to May 2017, when his company sent him to Afghanistan, where he has worked 
since.2 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems, which include tax returns that were 
not filed on time, unpaid taxes, delinquent debts, and two Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases. 
He attributes his financial problems to his lost job in 2011, an IRS audit in about 2010 or 
2011, the death of his certified public accountant (CPA) in April 2013, the early 
termination of his job in Afghanistan in 2013, and being the sole provider for his wife 
and children. His wife recently graduated from college, and his daughter is still in 
college.3 
 
 Applicant filed his 2007 federal income tax return on time, but he did not pay all 
the taxes owed. In September 2017, the IRS applied $2,062 from what would have 
been a refund from his 2015 taxes (overpayment) to pay the remainder that was owed 
for 2007.4 
 
 Applicant’s 2008 federal income tax return was filed in April 2010. In March 2015, 
the IRS applied $1,789 from the overpayment of his 2014 taxes to pay the remainder 
that was owed for 2008.5 
 
 Applicant filed his 2009 federal income tax return on time, but he did not pay all 
the taxes owed. The IRS applied $9,369 from the overpayment of his 2016 taxes and

$6,275 from the overpayment of his 2017 taxes to his 2009 taxes. As of October 2018, 
he still owed the IRS $30,009 for tax year 2009.6 
 
 Applicant did not file his 2010 federal income tax return when it was due. His 
CPA prepared the return in June 2011, but it was not submitted to the IRS until April 
2014. The IRS filed a substitute return in March 2012. The IRS applied $3,715 from the 
overpayment of his 2015 taxes to pay the remainder that was owed for 2010.7 
 
 Applicant stated that he thought his 2011 federal income return had been filed. 
IRS records indicate the 2011 tax return has still not been filed. He indicated that he had 
minimal income of about $6,000 in 2011. That amount would not require him to file a 
return if he was an employee. Because he was self-employed, he had to file a return.8 
 
 Applicant filed his 2012 federal income tax return on time with an extension, but 
he did not pay all the taxes owed. The IRS applied $1,076 from the overpayment of his 
2015 taxes and $159 from the overpayment of his 2016 taxes to pay the remainder that 
was owed for 2012.9 
 
 Applicant filed his 2013 federal income tax return in June 2014, but he did not 
pay all the taxes owed. As of October 2018, he owed the IRS $4,961.10 
 
 Applicant filed his 2014 federal income tax return on time. His 2015 and 2016 
federal income tax returns were filed in September 2017. His 2017 federal income tax 
return was filed on time. He would have received refunds each year if he did not owe 
back taxes. His overpayments were applied to taxes owed for previous tax years.11 
 
 Applicant established a $248 per month installment agreement with the IRS in 
September 2018. The first payment was not yet due when the record closed. As of the 
date of the installment agreement, he owed a total of $34,971 in taxes, penalties, and 
interest for tax years 2009 and 2013.12 
 
 Applicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in 2010. Under 
Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $99,501 in secured 
claims, which included a mortgage loan, a vehicle loan, and homeowner’s association 
(HOA) dues. Under Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured Priority Claims, the

petition listed debts of $5,089 to the IRS for 2007 and 2009 taxes and $3,360 in 
attorney’s fees. The petition listed debts totaling $62,907 under Schedule F, Creditors 
Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims. The debts included $1,612 owed on the 
judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k.13 
 
 Applicant paid the approved Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan for about 37 months. 
The case was dismissed in October 2013 upon motion of the trustee. Applicant was 
$9,944 behind in payments, which constituted almost three months of payments. 
Applicant paid a total of $63,397 into the plan, but none of the taxes or other unsecured 
debts were paid. The trustee and Applicant’s bankruptcy attorney received $5,952. The 
remainder was paid to secured claims such as the mortgage and car loans and the 
HOA dues.14 
 
 Applicant and his wife filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in January 2014. 
In August 2014, the trustee moved to dismiss the bankruptcy because Applicant was 
$7,850 behind in payments, which constituted almost four months of payments. The 
case was dismissed in October 2014. Applicant paid $7,513 into the plan. The trustee 
and Applicant’s bankruptcy attorney received $5,062; $1,505 was paid to a mortgage 
loan; and $946 was refunded to Applicant and his wife.15 
 
 In addition to the tax and bankruptcy matters, the SOR alleges delinquent debts 
that were listed on a December 2016 credit report and an unpaid judgment that is not 
listed on any credit report in evidence. Applicant admitted owing the $1,171 debt alleged 
in SOR ¶ 1.j at one time, but he stated that the debt was settled for $800, and that he 
paid half the settlement amount. He paid $409.88 to the creditor in November 2017. The 
February 2018 credit report lists the debt with a $761 balance ($1,171 minus $410 
equals $761).16 
 
 Applicant denied owing the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k. The judgment is 
reported by LexisNexis as being filed in October 2005 for $1,612. As indicated above, 
the judgment was listed as a creditor in Applicant’s 2010 bankruptcy petition. However, 
there is no evidence that the creditor ever filed a claim with the bankruptcy court. The 
judgment was for back rent and eviction. As proof he did not owe the judgment, 
Applicant submitted a March 2005 statement from his landlord showing that from 2001 
through 2005, his rent was always paid on time. Applicant’s 2012 Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) shows that he lived in the rented house until 
September 2005, when he moved into the home that he purchased. The judgment is not 
listed on either of the credit reports in evidence.17

 SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a credit card debt that was $154 past due with a $597 balance. 
The debt is listed as such on the December 2016 credit report. The debt is listed on the 
February 2018 credit report as charged off in the amount of $643, transferred, with a 
zero balance. A collection company lists the debt with a $643 balance. Applicant denied 
owing the debt and stated that he had never heard of the bank. He stated that he called 
the bank, but they had no record of his account. He provided no documentation of his 
dispute.18 
 
 Applicant admitted owing the $8,979 charged-off auto loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m, 
but he stated that the account was closed. The December 2016 credit report lists the 
account as opened in 2005. The 2010 bankruptcy petition listed the debt with a balance 
of $18,818. The bankruptcy court allowed secured and unsecured claims of $18,473 on 
the debt. The creditor received $7,293 in principal and $1,637 in interest during the 
course of the bankruptcy. The debt was listed as a secured debt with a balance of 
$5,781 on the 2014 bankruptcy petition. There is no evidence that the creditor filed a 
claim with the bankruptcy court. Applicant stated that he settled the debt for $5,000 with 
a collection company in 2015. He stated that he paid $600 every two weeks until the 
collection company stopped accepting payments. The debt is not listed on the February 
2018 credit report.19  
 
 Applicant stated that his finances are now stable. He intends to pay his debts. He 
believes he can resolve his financial problems through his work in Afghanistan.20 
 
 Applicant submitted SF 86s in July 2012 and August 2016. He reported tax 
problems on both questionnaires, and he reported his Chapter 13 bankruptcy case on 
the May 2012 questionnaire. He did not intend to falsify the SF 86s or mislead the 
government about the state of his finances when he failed to report additional financial 
issues.21 
 
 Applicant submitted documents from military personnel recognizing his 
outstanding support of the mission in Afghanistan. He is praised for his dedication, 
selfless service, expertise, and “countless hours of hard work and continued 
responsiveness.”22  
 
Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,

1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts, 
dismissed Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases, unfiled tax returns, and unpaid federal income 
taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
 
8 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant attributes his financial problems to his lost job in 2011, an IRS audit in 
about 2010 or 2011, the death of his CPA in April 2013, the early termination of his job 
in Afghanistan in 2013, and being the sole provider for his wife and children. The loss of 
his jobs in 2011 and 2013 and his CPA’s death in 2013 were beyond his control, but his 
financial problems predate those issues. Of particular concern is his failure to file his 
federal income tax returns on time and pay his taxes. Failure to comply with tax laws 
suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government 
rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such 
as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree 
of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified 
information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018).  
 
 All of Applicant’s federal income tax returns have been filed, with the exception of 
tax year 2011. SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant owes the IRS $51,374 for tax years 
2007, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013. His large refunds for the last four years have been 
applied to previous tax years. He established that all tax years except 2009 and 2013 
have been paid, and the amount owed has been reduced to $34,971. He recently 
entered into an installment agreement. While those actions are positive indicators, they 
are insufficient to mitigate the still unresolved tax problems from tax years 2009, 2011, 
and 2013. AG ¶ 20(g) is applicable to all the tax years except 2009, 2011, and 2013.  
 
 I accept Applicant’s statements that the judgment and the car loan (SOR ¶¶ 1.k 
and 1.m) are resolved or sufficiently attenuated, and those debts are mitigated. He 
stated that he settled the $1,171 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j for $800 and that he paid 
$400 toward the settlement. He documented a $409 payment, which means the 
settlement has not been completed. That debt is not mitigated. He denied owing the 
debt alleged in SOR 1.l, but he provided no supporting documentation. That debt is also 
not mitigated. 
 
9 
 
I am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or 
that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and 
ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. Security concerns raised by Applicant’s finances are not mitigated.  
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
  The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect 
classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful 
and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other 
failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. 
 
  AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
  
 Applicant did not intentionally submit false information about his finances on his 
2012 and 2016 SF 86s. AG ¶ 16(a) has not been established. SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.f 
are concluded for Applicant.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
 
10 
 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant’s 
outstanding support of the mission in Afghanistan. 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted 
the personal conduct security concerns, but he did not mitigate the financial 
considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.d-1.f:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g-1.j:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.k:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.l:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.m:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a-2.f:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
