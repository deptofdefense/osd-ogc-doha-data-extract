CEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 10, 2017, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended 
(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) 
alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F.1 The SOR further informed 
Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators 
could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant or continue Applicant’s security clearance. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on April 19, 2017, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2017. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 
31, 2017, scheduling the hearing for November 28, 2017. The hearing was convened as 
scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 8, which were admitted 
                                                          
1 I considered the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new 
Adjudicative Guidelines, effective June 8, 2017. My decision would be the same if the case was 
considered under the previous Adjudicative Guidelines, effective September 1, 2006.

into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. The record was left open until 
February 2, 2018, for receipt of additional documentation. On February 2, 2018, 
Applicant presented one packet of documents, which I marked Applicant’s Exhibit 
(AppX) A and admitted into evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) 
on December 5, 2017. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c. He denied SOR 
allegation ¶ 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and 
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 5.) 
He has been employed with the defense contractor since May of 2015. (GX 2 at page 
2.) Through the Army National Guard, he has held a security clearance since about 
February of 2009. (GX 1 at pages 36~37, see also AppX A at pages 2~3.) He is 
married, and has “three daughters.” (TR at page 24 lines 3~25.) 
 
Guideline F – Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant attributes his admitted financial difficulties to a period of unemployment 
“from December of 2012 to June of 2013.” (TR at page 27 line 20 to page 31 line 24.) 
 
 1.a. Applicant admits that he was indebted to a mortgage company for a past-
due debt in the amount of about $76,881. (TR at page 26 line 6 to page 34 line 24.) The 
monthly mortgage payments have been modified; and Applicant is current with this 
debt, as evidenced by a “Loan Modification Agreement” (AppX A at pages 4~9), and the 
Government’s most recent November 2017 credit report (CR) (GX 8 at page 2.) This 
allegation is found for Applicant. 
 
 1.b. Applicant admits that he was indebted to an automobile manufacturer for a 
past-due debt in the amount of about $14,210. (TR at page 35 line 5 to page 38 line 4.) 
This debt has been settled for $5,684 and “RESOLVED,” as evidenced by 
documentation from the successor creditor to this debt. (AppX A at pages 10~11.) This 
allegation is found for Applicant. 
 
 1.c. Applicant admits that he is indebted to an motorcycle manufacturer for a 
past-due debt in the amount of about $9,982. (TR at page 38 line 5 to page 40 line 17.) 
Despite have an additional two plus months to address this admitted debt, Applicant has 
offered nothing further in this regard. (TR at page 43 line 21 to page 44 line 11.) This 
allegation is found against Applicant. 
 
 1.d. Applicant denies that he was indebted to a phone company for a past-due 
debt in the amount of about $37. (TR at page 41 line 15 to page 42 line 12.) As this 
alleged debt does not appear on the Government’s most recent November 2017 CR, 
this allegation is found for Applicant.

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility, the administrative 
judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory 
explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant’s 
national security eligibility. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious 
scrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 states the “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
 A person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a 
fiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or 
safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally 
permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of 
classified information. 
 
Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall 
be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the 
loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).

Analysis 
 
Guideline F - Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
  Applicant had significant past-due indebtedness The evidence is sufficient to 
raise these disqualifying conditions.  
 
 AG ¶ 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered 
all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 including: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
 
5 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
While Applicant can attribute his admitted debts to a period of unemployment, 
has resolved two of his admitted debts, and has successfully disputed another, an 
admitted significant past-due debt for nearly $10,000 has yet to be addressed. 
Applicant’s financial problems are therefore ongoing, and he has not demonstrated that 
future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b) has not been 
established. 
  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant has an honorable record in the Army National Guard, including two 
overseas deployments. (AppX A at pages 2~3.) 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant’s 
eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude 
Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d.    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility 
for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
