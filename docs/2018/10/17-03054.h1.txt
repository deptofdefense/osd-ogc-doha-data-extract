FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on March 8, 2016. On 
February 28, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive 
Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 
20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial 
Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive 
Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for 
all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017.  
  
 Applicant answered the SOR on March 28, 2018, and requested a decision on 
the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government’s 
written case on May 16, 2018. On May 22, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant 
 
 2
material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s evidence. He 
received the FORM on July 11, 2018, and did not respond. The case was assigned to 
me on October 11, 2018.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions 
are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 59-year-old assembly mechanic employed by a defense contractor 
since November 2014. He has never held a security clearance.  
 
Applicant married in March 1992 and divorced in April 2003. He remarried in May 
2013. He and his current wife have a nine-year-old daughter. He has four stepchildren, 
ages 32, 21, 18, and 16.  
 
Applicant worked in the private sector from December 1977 to April 2008, when 
he retired. He took a lump-sum payment of his pension and withdrew all the funds in his 
401(k) retirement account. He did not have any federal or state taxes withheld from the 
two payouts. When he filed his federal and state tax returns for 2008, he owed $87,407 
in federal taxes and $12,515 in state taxes, which he could not afford to pay.  
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state returns for tax years 2009 
through 2013. He filed his returns for 2009 in April 2014; for 2010, 2011, and 2012 in 
June 2014; and for 2013 in July 2014. His federal and state returns for tax years 2014 to 
the present have been filed on time.  
 
 For 2009, Applicant owed about $32,751 in federal taxes and $5,792 in state 
taxes. For 2010, he did not owe any federal or state taxes. For 2011, he owed $621 in 
federal taxes and no state taxes. For 2012, he owed $1,832 in federal taxes and $33 in 
state taxes. For 2013, he owed $4,020 in federal taxes and $954 in state taxes. For 
2014, he owed $1,594 in federal taxes and $214 in state taxes. Starting in 2014, he has 
intentionally overwithheld federal and state taxes so that the overpayments can be 
applied to his tax debts. 
 
 In November 2013, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant for $138,000. In 
October 2014, the IRS filed another tax lien against him for $101,000. (Item 7 at 3.) The 
IRS applied Applicant’s overpayment of $888 in 2015 to his tax debt for 2008, leaving a 
balance due of $105,816. (Item 5 at 1.) It applied Applicant’s overpayment of $1,222 for 
2016 to his tax debt for 2008, leaving a balance of $108,797. (Item 5 at 2.) 
 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

 The state tax authority garnished Applicant’s pay in March 2015 and again in 
May 2016. (Item 6 at 1-2.) A consolidated billing notice from the state reflects that, as of 
January 5, 2018, Applicant owed $26,005 in state taxes. (Item 4 at 13.) 
 
 After about two years in retirement, Applicant realized that he could not afford to 
remain retired, and in April 2010, he began working as a store manager and repairman. 
He also began working part time as a janitor. (Item 4 at 19.) In November 2014, he was 
hired by his current employer, a defense contractor.  
 
 While unemployed and underemployed, Applicant used credit cards for living 
expenses, and a judgment was entered against him for about $15,000 in credit-card 
debt. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in April 2015 and received a discharge in 
July 2015. Debts totaling about $70,971 were discharged, but the delinquent federal 
and state taxes were not discharged. 
 
 Applicant has contacted the IRS and the state tax authority but has not yet made 
any payment agreements. Notwithstanding his substantial tax debt, he traveled outside 
the United States on a family vacation in September 2015, and he went on a seven-day 
Caribbean cruise in December 2017. (Item 3 at 31; Item 4 at 2.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
 
 4
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-
01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that a federal tax lien was filed against Applicant in 2013 for 
about $138,000, another federal tax lien was filed against him in 2014 for about 
$101,000, and a state tax lien was filed against him in 2015 for about $24,624 (SOR ¶¶ 
1.a, 1.b, and 1.e). It also alleges that he failed to file his federal and state income tax 
returns for 2008 through 2013, that he failed to pay the federal taxes due for 2008, 
2009, and 2011 through 2014, and that he failed to pay the state taxes due for 2007 
through 2009 and 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d). It alleges that his wages were garnished 
in May 2015 for $3,302, but it does not allege who filed the writ of garnishment (SOR ¶ 
1.f). Finally, it alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in April 2015 
and received a discharge (SOR ¶ 1.g). 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
 
 5
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the 
following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(f): failure to file . . . or pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required. 
 
The following mitigating conditions are relevant:  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
 
 6
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are not established. Applicant’s failures to timely 
file his federal and state tax income returns and the resulting tax debts are recent, 
numerous, and did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. His 
tax debts are not the result of conditions largely beyond his control, but rather were the 
result of his ignorance of the tax consequences of taking a lump-sum pension and 
withdrawing all of his 401(k) retirement account. His Chapter 7 bankruptcy was the 
result of excessive reliance on credit cards for living expenses. His two vacations in 
2014 and 2015, notwithstanding his overwhelming tax debts, indicate lack of concern 
about his tax debts. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations 
does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those 
granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 15-00216 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 
24, 2016), citing Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 
173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  
 
AG ¶ 20(f) is not fully established. Applicant receives some credit for filing his 
overdue federal and state income tax returns. However, a security clearance 
adjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual’s 
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed his past-due 
returns “does not preclude careful consideration of Applicant’s security worthiness 
based on longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.” ISCR Case No. 12-
05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).2  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). Because Applicant requested 
a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his 
credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. 
Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under 
Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his failures to 
timely file and pay federal and state income taxes, his federal and state tax debts, and 
his Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
                                                          
2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.
