GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations. 
Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 30, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted 
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On January 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), 
(December 10, 2016), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered 
individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or 
eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), 
and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on January 12, 2018. In a notarized statement, dated 
January 25, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to 
proceed on February 14, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018.  A 
Notice of Hearing was issued on June 29, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
July 26, 2018. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5, and Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE C were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 7, 2018. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely 
submitted several documents which were marked and admitted as AE D through AE V 
without objection. The record originally closed on August 23, 2018, but because of 
technical difficulties, it remained open until October 24, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments only one of the 
factual allegations in the SOR (SOR ¶ 1.g.), and he denied with comments the remaining 
allegations. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of 
fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due 
consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old contract employee of a defense contractor. He has been 
serving as an over-the-road truck driver or owner-operator with a series of different 
employers since 2006. He completed his high school education through a General 
Educational Development (GED) test in 1994. Applicant has never served with the U.S. 
military. He was granted a Transportation Worker Identification Credential - also known 
as TWIC®  - in 2010.1 Applicant was married in March 1997, and divorced in October 2012. 
He remarried in October 2015. He has three children, born in 1997, 1999, and 2001. 
 
  
  
                                                          
1 The TWIC® is required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act for workers who need access 
to secure areas of the nation’s maritime facilities and vessels. The Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) conducts a security threat assessment (background check) to determine a person’s eligibility and 
issues the credential. U.S. citizens and immigrants in certain immigration categories may apply for the 
credential. See www.tsa.gov/for-industry/twic

Financial Considerations2 
  
Applicant and his ex-wife had an explosive relationship that deteriorated over a 
series of issues: he characterized her as “crazy,” but he did not specify what he meant by 
that characterization, other than by saying that she blamed him “for a lot of stuff,” not 
otherwise described; she was always in a bad mood; she always wanted money for 
prescribed pain medication; because he was frequently on the road, she took over 
responsibility for handling the family finances, but instead of making the proper monthly 
payments on certain accounts, she spent a lot of money on her children from a prior 
relationship to “give them a good life;” and there was a situation involving domestic 
violence when she repeatedly struck him with a crutch and he grabbed her throat to stop 
her from doing so. In addition, they went through a toxic divorce. Applicant attributed his 
financial difficulties to his ex-wife’s actions and her misrepresentation to the divorce court 
about his income, resulting in his being ordered to pay her child support at a higher 
amount than he reasonably could afford; and her failure or refusal to take responsibility 
for the marital debts that she was ordered to pay, and to hold Applicant harmless for 
them.3  
The Divorce Order to which Applicant referred, specifically ordered: Applicant’s ex-
wife was to maintain residence in the marital home until their daughter (born in May 1999) 
reached the age of 18½ years, at which time (the end of 2017) the property was to be 
appraised and sold, with Applicant receiving a specific share of the proceeds; they were 
to receive the personal property in their possession or control, free from any claims; they 
were to keep and retain their respective motor vehicles, free from any claims of the other, 
and hold the other party harmless from any indebtedness which may be due on their 
respective motor vehicles; she was to be responsible for all land contract payments, 
maintenance and taxes; and in the event there is indebtedness owing on any of the 
property, “the party receiving the said property shall discharge any and all indebtedness 
thereon, and hold the opposite party harmless from any and all liability.”4  
The Uniform Child Support Order, attached to the Divorce Order, specified that, 
effective September 1, 2012, Applicant was to pay $679 per month in child-support 
obligations, covering all three children, based on Applicant’s purported monthly gross 
income of $2,251.5 In addition, although Applicant was to have reasonable visitation 
rights, he contended that nearly every time he attempted to exercise those rights, his ex-
wife refused to let him see the children. The Divorce Order also specified that neither

parent “shall do anything which may estrange the child from the other parent, or tend to 
discredit, cause disrespect or diminish the natural affection of the child for the other 
parent.”6 Applicant purchased school clothing for the children, and paid for his ex-wife’s 
vehicle tires for his children’s safety, and on one occasion, just to see his son, Applicant 
gave his ex-wife $4,000 cash, but because he failed to do so through the state’s child 
support division, he did not receive any credit for his expenses, cash payments, or gifts.7 
Eventually, Applicant sought court protection, but all he was told was “keep trying.” His 
unsuccessful repeated efforts to see his children over the years cost him approximately 
$30,000 in attorney fees, motel expenses, time-off from work, vehicle rentals, and inter-
state airplane expenses.8 Furthermore, because of his ex-wife’s actions, Applicant no 
longer has any relationship with his children.9 Applicant became frustrated, bitter, and 
angry over being denied access to his children by his ex-wife; because she had destroyed 
his relationship with the children; because she smoked marijuana with the children; and 
because of her failure to make them go to school. Applicant stopped making the child-
support payments.10 An arrearage materialized, and at one point, that arrearage balance 
was between $21,392 and $27,324.11 
The SOR identified seven purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed 
for collection or filed as judgments, as generally reflected by Applicant’s November 2016 
credit report, December 2017 credit report, or June 2018 credit report. Those debts total 
approximately $47,707. The current status of those accounts, is as follows.  
 (SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a satellite television account with an unpaid balance of 
$296.12 Applicant contended that when he and his ex-wife separated, while she was 
working for that particular satellite company, he cancelled the account and returned the 
equipment to the company. However, she restored the account in his name without his 
knowledge or permission. Applicant disputed the account with TransUnion in June 2018, 
and after an investigation, TransUnion informed him by e-mail that the debt was being 
removed from his credit report.13 Applicant’s June 2018 Experian credit report indicates 
that he disputed the account and that a reinvestigation was in progress.14 The account 
has been resolved.

(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a septic system installation or repair account on the residence 
where Applicant’s ex-wife was residing with an unpaid balance of $1,566 that was filed 
as a judgment in August 2012.15 Applicant contended that because his ex-wife remained 
in the residence, under the terms of the Divorce Order, she was responsible for the 
charges and is required to hold him harmless for the charges.16 Applicant informed the 
creditor of his ex-wife’s responsibility for the debt, but the creditor did not care about her 
responsibility, and rather than placing a lien on the property, they obtained a judgment 
against Appellant.17 Applicant mailed the creditor a copy of the Divorce Order, and he is 
waiting for a response from the representative of the creditor.18 While the judgment was 
listed in Applicant’s 2016 credit report, it is not listed in any of his subsequent credit 
reports. Moreover, since the court ordered that Applicant’s ex-wife was responsible for 
the charges and is required to hold him harmless for those charges, Applicant should not 
be held legally responsible for the debt. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.c.): This is a motor vehicle loan for a pickup truck (driven by Applicant’s 
ex-wife) in the amount of $35,000 that Applicant purchased in 2001, but for which he was 
unable to continue making payments, so he voluntarily relinquished it to the lender in 
2005. In June 2013, the lender filed a $17,653 judgment against Applicant.19 Applicant 
informed the creditor of his intention to resolve the account once the marital residence is 
sold, but the attorneys for the lender were disinterested, and simply wanted to be paid 
the full amount.20 Applicant considers the debt to be a marital debt for which both he and 
his ex-wife are responsible, and he intended to pay his half of the debt from the proceeds 
from the sale of the marital residence.21 When Applicant spoke with the creditor on August 
10, 2018, after having mailed them a copy of the Divorce Order, the representative of the 
creditor stated the debt would be removed from Applicant and assigned to his ex-wife.22 
Applicant did not submit any statement from the creditor to confirm what he claimed they 
told him. Nevertheless, while the judgment was listed in Applicant’s 2016 credit report, it 
is not listed in any of his subsequent credit reports. Since the court ordered that 
Applicant’s ex-wife was responsible for the charges and is required to hold him harmless 
for those charges, Applicant should not be held legally responsible for the debt.

(SOR ¶ 1.d.): This is a medical account with an unpaid and past-due balance of 
$200 that was opened in October 2012, the same month as his divorce from his ex-wife.23 
Although Applicant did not believe the account was his responsibility, when he learned 
about it, he paid it off.24 However, he failed to submit any documents to support his claim 
that the account has been resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.e.): This is a motor vehicle loan for a pickup truck in the amount of 
$10,945 that Applicant purchased for his ex-wife in 2009 or 2010. She retained the vehicle 
when they were divorced, and under their divorce decree, she was to maintain the vehicle 
and make the monthly payments. She failed to do so, and at some unspecified point in 
late 2016, the vehicle was involuntarily repossessed, leaving an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $5,487.25 Applicant contended that because his ex-wife kept custody of the 
vehicle, under the terms of the divorce decree, she was responsible for the charges and 
is required to hold him harmless for those charges.26  
(SOR ¶ 1.f.): This is a child-support arrearage with an unpaid balance of $21,392.27 
In mid-2015, Applicant decided to get back on track with his child-support payments, and 
he tried to pay the court $600 to $900 on a monthly basis to cover the current obligation 
of $495, along with an arrearage amount.28 In 2017, his payments were rather sporadic.29 
But since November 2017, months before the SOR was issued, Applicant has been 
making regular monthly $600 child-support payments to the state, totaling $5,400.30 The 
account is in the process of being resolved. 
(SOR ¶ 1.g.): This is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $1,113 that was 
placed for collection in January 2014.31 During his interview with an investigator from the 
U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2017, Applicant said he knew 
nothing about the account, but that he would look into it and if it is his responsibility, he 
would set up payments to resolve it.32 Applicant did not indicate if he has taken any

actions regarding this account, and it remains unclear if the account was opened by his 
ex-wife after their divorce or if the account is actually Applicant’s responsibility. 
As noted above, with the exception of those delinquent accounts that are legally 
the responsibility of his ex-wife under the Divorce Order, Applicant has indicated an 
intention to resolve the other accounts that are legitimately his responsibility by utilizing 
the proceeds from the sale of the marital residence which they purchased in July 2008. 
The terms of payment on the purchase of the property called for an initial payment of 
$23,868 in 2008; the remaining $21,368 balance to be paid in $400 monthly installments; 
and any remaining unpaid balance and interest to be paid within five years.33 The Divorce 
Order is very specific regarding the division of the property. At some point in mid-2017, 
the property was to be sold and both Applicant and his ex-wife were to be entitled to equal 
equity based on the value stated in an appraisal conducted in June 2012, to-wit: $32,500. 
When the property is sold, in the event the value decreased from the date of the appraisal, 
Applicant was to receive not less than 90 percent of his 50 percent share of the appraised 
value. If there is an increase in value, Applicant was entitled to no more than his 50 
percent share of the appraised value.34  
A Real Property Transaction Record from the county register of deeds reports that, 
on March 27, 2017, a cash sale in the amount of $20,930, took place on a warranty deed, 
and the transaction was recorded on March 9, 2018, seemingly indicating that the 
property had been sold by Applicant’s ex-wife.35 That document is misleading. In fact, the 
original 2008 seller of the property granted Applicant and his ex-wife a Warranty Deed on 
March 27, 2017, indicating that $23,868 (the initial purchase price) had been paid, and 
the deed was issued in fulfillment of the 2008 land contract.36 Applicant denied that he 
had any knowledge of the 2017 or 2018 transactions, that he signed any documents 
associated with the transactions, or that he received any funds from the transactions. 
Interestingly, the value of the property as of October 23, 2018, is an estimated $106,388,37 
and if true, Applicant is expected to receive over $50,000 from the proceeds of the 
anticipated sale of the property by Applicant and his ex-wife, a transaction that is now 
nearly one year past due. 
Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement, prepared on August 18, 
2018. It reflected a monthly net income of $9,039; monthly expenses of $7,924; monthly 
debt payments, including $600 in child support of $1,100; and a monthly remainder of 
$15 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.38 Other than the

delinquent debts listed above, Applicant is not aware of any other delinquent account. 
There is no evidence of financial counseling. Nevertheless, Applicant has made 
significant progress in maintaining his finances and avoiding other more recent financial 
delinquencies. Once he persuades his ex-wife to comply with the Divorce Order to sell 
their house, he intends to address his remaining delinquent accounts to resolve them.  
Character References 
 A number of over-the-road, long-haul owner-operator drivers have known 
Applicant for several years, and they characterize him in positive terms. One project 
manager has known Applicant for over 30 years, and he described Applicant as a hard 
worker and, to all that know him, Applicant is considered a very trustworthy and 
dependable person who displays the utmost discretion and integrity.39 Other drivers 
consider Applicant as very honest, helpful, hardworking, caring, religious, and possessing 
a heart of gold.40 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”41 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”42   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are

applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”43 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.44  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”45  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”46 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical,

Analysis 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
  
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:        
  
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage.  
  
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19:   
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
  
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
  
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
  
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other 
negative financial indicators.  
  
Applicant had seven purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for 
collection or filed as judgments, totaling approximately $47,707. While most of those 
accounts are the result of his ex-wife’s failure or refusal to comply with a Divorce Order, 
she is legally responsible for several of those delinquent debts, and she is required to 
hold Applicant harmless for them. Applicant did allow his frustrations, bitterness, and 
anger over some of her actions, especially with respect to their three children, to get the 
better of him, and he stopped paying his mandated child support for a period of time. 
Child support arrearage rose to between $21,392 and $27,324. There is some evidence 
that he was unwilling to satisfy that child support obligation, but there is also no evidence 
that he had the ability to do so. There is no evidence of frivolous or irresponsible spending, 
or consistent spending beyond his means. AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, 
and AG ¶ 19(b) has been partially established. AG ¶ 19(e) has not been established.  
 
11 
                                      
 
     
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;47 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;48 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
I have concluded that ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) all partially or fully 
apply. Aside from a voluntary 2005 vehicle repossession, Applicant’s financial difficulties 
initially arose in or about mid-2012, and they were exacerbated by his ex-wife’s actions 
                                                          
47 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
48 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or 
statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

or inaction over the ensuing years: while Applicant was on the road, she took over 
responsibilities for the family finances, but failed to make some routine monthly payments; 
and she spent money that should have been paid to creditors on her children from a 
previous relationship to give them a good life. After their divorce, the Divorce Order 
mandated that she take responsibility over certain marital debts, especially for the 
property that she retained, and she was to hold Applicant harmless for those accounts. 
She failed or refused to comply with the court mandates. Those factors, especially the 
post-divorce factors, were clearly beyond Applicant’s control. Although he attempted to 
get the court involved in getting those accounts resolved, he was unsuccessful in doing 
so.  
  
Applicant had two reasonable plans to resolve the delinquent marital debts. 
Obviously, the first plan was to have his ex-wife comply with the court mandates to pay 
her debts and hold Applicant harmless for them. That plan was a disaster, for she simply 
failed or refused to do so. The second plan was for the marital residence to be sold under 
the court mandate by mid-2017, and he would take the proceeds from his share of the 
sale to pay his remaining debts. To date, that plan is still on hold, pending Applicant’s ex-
wife’s actions in complying with the court-mandate. Nevertheless, Applicant has made 
significant strides in addressing his child support arrearage, starting to do so well before 
the SOR was issued.  
                                                          
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time.   
While there is no evidence that Applicant received financial counseling, Applicant 
has made significant progress in stabilizing his finances and avoiding other more recent 
financial delinquencies. With a current monthly remainder of $15 that might be available 
for discretionary spending or savings, Applicant’s finances appear to be under better 
control than they were when he was married to his ex-wife. When confronted with the 
issues that caused the marital financial problems, and faced with insufficient funds to 
immediately remedy the situation by himself, Applicant relied on the court system to assist 
him in resolving those debts. To date, his ex-wife has ignored her court-mandated 
responsibilities. At the same time, with his available finances, Applicant has been 
complying with his court-mandated responsibilities, especially pertaining to his child 
support obligations.49 Once the former marital home is sold, he intends to focus on his 
                                                          
49 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 990462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd.

few remaining delinquent accounts to resolve them.50 Applicant’s actions under the 
circumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.51  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.52  
  
There is some evidence against mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Although 
Applicant’s credit reports reflect a number of delinquent accounts that had been placed 
for collection or filed as judgments, totaling approximately $47,707, his personal legal 
responsibility, according to the Divorce Order covers a portion of the judgment on the 
2005 vehicle repossession and the child support arrearage that commenced when he 
stopped making child-support payments. There is a possibility that he may also be 
responsible for two medical accounts that arose at about the time he was divorced or 
some time thereafter.  
                                                          
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.  
50 It should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts 
in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting 
in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR 
Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

The mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant is a 45-year-old contract employee of a defense contractor, serving as an over-
the-road truck driver or owner-operator with a series of different employers since 2006. 
He was granted a TWIC® in 2010. While his ex-wife has ignored her court-mandated 
responsibilities,                                                                                                                     Applicant 
has been complying with his court-mandated responsibilities, especially pertaining to his 
child support obligations. Since November 2017, he has paid $5,400 in current child 
support and child support arrearage.  
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:53 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
Applicant has demonstrated a fair-to-good track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, addressing the debts for which he is responsible, limited only by 
insufficient funds, and lining up the remaining debt(s) for eventual resolution. Overall, the 
evidence leaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility 
and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has 
mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, 
App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
