HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided insufficient information about his efforts to resolve nine 
delinquent debts alleged on the statement of reasons (SOR) totaling $115,946. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On March 5, 2014, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Position (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1). On February 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in 
Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
 
2 
                                         
 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (HE 2) 
 
On March 5, 2018, Applicant provided a response to the SOR. (HE 3) On April 13, 
2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On July 23, 2018, the case was 
assigned to me. On August 22, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued 
a notice setting Applicant’s hearing for September 5, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing 
was held as scheduled. Department Counsel provided three exhibits; Applicant did not 
provide any documents; and all exhibits were admitted without objections. (Tr. 13, 16-17; 
GE 1-6; AE A-C) On September 12, 2018, I received the transcript of the hearing. No 
post-hearing documents were received.   
  
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.d, 1.h, and 1.i. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. 
His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old maintenance manager, and he has worked for a DOD 
contractor for the previous six years. (Tr. 9) In 1984, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 
6) In 1983, he joined the Army as part of the Delayed Entry Program; in 1984, he went on 
active duty; and in 1987, he left the military with an honorable discharge. (Tr. 7) In the 
Army, he was a helicopter mechanic. (Tr. 7) He was married briefly in 1988, and from 
1990 to 2003. (Tr. 7-8)  In 2011, he married. (Tr. 8) His children are ages 24 and 28. (Tr. 
8) He has worked for the government or a government contractor for 35 years. (Tr. 43) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant has no periods of unemployment in the previous 10 years. (Tr. 18) His 
annual salary is $72,000, and he shares expenses with his spouse. (Tr. 33) His main 
expenses are $1,528 for his truck and motorcycles, $300 monthly for vehicle insurance, 
and $1,028 monthly for his mortgage in the residence he shares with his spouse. (Tr. 34-
35) He drives a 2016 truck; he cosigned on a vehicle loan for $49,000 for his spouse; and 
he borrowed $27,000 for a motorcycle. (Tr. 36-37)  
 
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $115,946, as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is a bank debt placed for collection for $5,412. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off bank debt for $3,037. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c is a bank debt placed for collection for $876.  
 
                                            
1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 
                                         
 
SOR ¶ 1.d is a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $615. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e is a department store debt placed for collection for $356. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f is a delinquent child support debt for $41. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g is a delinquent telecommunications debt for $97. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h is a bank debt placed for collection for $10,750. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i is a mortgage of $94,762 past due in the amount of $12,865. 
 
Applicant said his child support account (SOR ¶ 1.f) is current, and he denied that 
he owed the telecommunications debt (SOR ¶ 1.g). (Tr. 31) He contacted the creditors in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g. (Tr. 32-33) The creditors did not indicate to him that the accounts 
were delinquent. (Tr. 31-33)   
 
Applicant indicated he owed the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i. (Tr. 
19) Applicant authorized a woman living with him to handle his finances, and she 
generated the delinquent debts. (Tr. 21-23) The debts are in Applicant’s name. (Tr. 28) 
Applicant was often away from home, and he was unable to supervise the handling of his 
finances. (Tr. 23) In 2009, he ended the relationship with the woman. (Tr. 23-24) He 
learned of the delinquent debts around 2009. (Tr. 24-26) He tried to contact her to obtain 
her assistance with payment of the debts; however, he did not receive her help and now 
he cannot locate her. (Tr. 29)  
 
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i relates to the foreclosure of Applicant’s residence, which 
occurred between 2009 and 2011. (Tr. 41) His 2016 credit report indicates the last 
reported delinquency was in November 2011; the account was 180 days past due in the 
amount of $12,865; and foreclosure proceedings were initiated. (GE 3) He was unsure 
whether he owed the creditor anything after the foreclosure. (Tr. 41-43) His 2017 credit 
report did not list the mortgage account in SOR ¶ 1.i. (GE 2)  
 
When he contacted his creditors, he was unable to afford the monthly payments 
they wanted. (Tr. 29) He did not make any payments to the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i after 2009. (Tr. 30)  
 
Around March 5, 2018, Applicant retained a credit repair company (CRC) to assist 
him with his finances. (Tr. 27-28) On March 5, 2018, the president of a CRC wrote that 
they were assisting in the dispute of false information on his credit report. (SOR response) 
CRC wrote all of Applicant’s creditors, and told Applicant not to contact his creditors. (Tr. 
18, 26, 30-31) Applicant wanted to pay one of the debts, and CRC told him not to do that 
because it was a “bad deal.” (Tr. 27) He paid CRC almost $800, and he believed CRC 
has started to repair his credit rating. (Tr. 18, 27) Later, he said he may have paid CRC 
about $1,400. (Tr. 40) His credit reports were clearing up; however, he was unsure what 
CRC was doing to accomplish his improved credit. (Tr. 27, 31)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
 
5 
                                         
 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
 Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,2 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;3 and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue.  
 
                                            
2 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
3 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $115,946.  Applicant denied the 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($41) and 1.g ($97), and he is credited with mitigation of these two 
SOR allegations. He employed CRC to improve his credit report; however, he conceded 
he was responsible for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i. A friend who 
was living with him irresponsibly handled his finances while he was away from home, 
which is a circumstance largely beyond his control. He does not receive full mitigating 
credit under AG 20(b) because he did not establish that he acted responsibly under the 
circumstances. He had more than six years to make progress resolving his delinquent 
debts, and he provided minimal evidence of progress.4 
 
Applicant’s credit reports indicate that several of his debts are in charged-off 
status. Eventually the charged-off debts will be dropped from his credit report. “[T]hat 
some debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt 
resolution.” ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 
14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal 
of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of 
delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of 
limitations, whichever is longer.5 Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute 
when creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond 
to a credit reporting company’s request for information, or when the debt has been 
                                            
4 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.  
 
5Title 15 U.S.C. § 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit 
Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-
act.pdf.

charged off. Applicant’s failure to provide more evidence of debt resolution precludes 
mitigation of the charged-off debts on his credit report. 
 
Applicant did not provide documentation relating to his SOR debts such as: (1) 
proof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or 
a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) 
correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of 
credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he 
did not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence 
of attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to 
show that he was attempting to resolve this debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or 
resolution.  
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to 
make greater documented progress resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, 1.h, 
and 1.i. There is insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being resolved and 
will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation 
of financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 52-year-old maintenance manager, and he has worked for a DOD 
contractor for the previous six years. Applicant served the federal government 35 years 
including service in the Army on active duty. He received an honorable discharge. There 
is no evidence of criminal activity or workplace misconduct. He has contributed to national 
security.   
 
 
9 
                                         
 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial. Applicant 
owes several delinquent debts totaling more than $115,000. There is no evidence of 
progress after 2009 in the resolution of seven delinquent debts. His actions raise 
unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information. See AG ¶ 18.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security 
clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 
10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the 
whole person. Financial consideration security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance 
eligibility at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.h and 1.i:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.
