APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
21, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline M (Use of Information Technology), Guideline
K (Handling Protected Information), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense
Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June
15, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge
Richard A. Cefola denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant
to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant  raised the following issue on appeal:  whether the Judge’s decision was arbitrary,
capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact and Analysis 
Applicant, who is 43 years old, has been working for his current employer since 2015 and
has intermittently held a security clearance since about 2004.  From about 2011 to 2014, he illegally
downloaded songs and movies to his personal computer.  He admits that conduct and describes it
as “foolish.”  Decision at 2.  In 2008, he violated security guidelines by knowingly taking home
classified documents.  A year later, he admitted the improper handling of classified information
when confronted with a polygraph examination.   
Applicant’s illegal downloading of material occurred more than three years ago.  His
improper handling of classified information occurred over nine years ago.  Due to the passage of
time, the Guideline M and K allegations were found in favor of Applicant.  Under Guideline E,
however, his security violation coupled with the illegal downloading of material constitutes a pattern
of dishonesty and rule violations that is not mitigated.   
Discussion
In the SOR, the Guideline M and K allegations were cross-alleged as the sole Guideline E
allegation.  On appeal, Applicant contends that the Judge reached contradictory conclusions by
finding for him on the Guideline M and K allegations and against him under Guideline E.  This
argument lacks merit.  An applicant’s security related conduct can be alleged under more than one
guideline and, in an appropriate case, be given independent weight by an administrative judge under
different guidelines.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09251 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007).  In this case,
there was a rational basis for the Judge to conclude that the conduct alleged under Guidelines M and
K, when viewed together, established a pattern of misconduct under Guideline E.  We note
Disqualifying Condition 16(c) encapsulates this concept by stating security concerns can arise when 
credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient
for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when
considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable
judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply
2
with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may
not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.1
Applicant asserts that it is not effectively possible to rebut the presumption that a Judge
considered all the evidence.  He also insinuates that applicants cannot win before the Appeal Board. 
Recently, we issued several decisions where applicants have effectively rebutted the presumption
and won either remands or reversals at the Board.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06990 (App. Bd. Jan.
11, 2018); ISCR Case No. 15-05565 (App. Bd Aug.  2, 2017); ISCR Case No. 12-10335 (App. Bd.
Jul. 21, 2017); ISCR Case No. 15-07242 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2017); ISCR Case No. 14-06592 (App.
Bd. Apr. 20, 2016); and ISCR Case No. 14-05150 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).
   
Applicant’s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of
the evidence.  He argues, for example, that he regrets the alleged misconduct, has ceased engaging
in that behavior, and more than three years have passed without recurrence.   He also contends the
alleged misconduct was unrelated, not sequenced, and does not constitute a pattern of rule
violations.  However, a party’s disagreement with the Judge’s weighing of the evidence, or an ability
to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge
weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary
to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08684 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 22, 2017).
The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may
be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department
of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt
concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor
of the national security.”
