HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 In December 2017, Applicant filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax 
years 2010, 2011, and 2012. Financial considerations security concerns are not 
mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.        
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On February 5, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1. On December 2, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines 
for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 
2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs). Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2. The SOR set forth security concerns 
arising under the financial considerations guideline.  
 
On January 5, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested 
a hearing. HE 3. On August 29, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On 
September 6, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On November 8, 2017, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for November 30, 2017. HE 1. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.

During the hearing, Department Counsel offered 5 exhibits; Applicant offered 14 
exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. 
Transcript (Tr.) 15-19; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE N. On December 13, 2017, 
DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript. I received one exhibit after the hearing.

The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive 
Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position on or after June 8, 2017. The new AGs supersede the previous AGs. Accordingly, 
I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1

The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts and failure to timely file some federal 
and state tax returns. The record establishes the status of the SOR allegations is as 
follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a mortgage past due in the amount of $29,954 with a total loan 
balance of $147,309. Applicant refinanced his home, and the new mortgage was solely 
in Applicant’s name. Tr. 27. Applicant fell behind on his mortgage payments because of 
the garnishment for city real estate taxes assessed on his home. Tr. 21. His second 
spouse worked outside their home, and when they separated, the family income was 
reduced. Tr. 27. After the garnishment for city real estate taxes was completed, he 
resumed his mortgage payments, and he included an extra $100 to address the 
arrearage. Tr. 21. The mortgage company foreclosed. Tr. 21. In 2013, the creditor issued 
an IRS Form 1099-A indicating: the lender acquired Applicant’s residence in January 
2013; the fair market value of the property is $169,484; and the mortgage principal 
outstanding is $147,309. Tr. 28-29; AE D.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off bank debt for $1,345. On January 4, 2017, 
Applicant paid $1,345, and the creditor wrote that he was credited with payment in full of 
the debt. Tr. 29-30; AE A.  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g allege three bank debts placed for collection for $287, 
$1,209, and $741; SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for 
$209; and SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $71. In December 2016, 
Applicant paid these five debts. Tr. 30-32; AE B; AE F; AE H; AE J at 3; GE 4 at 1. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state tax returns for 
at least 2010. He disclosed his failure to file his federal and state tax returns for tax year 
2010 on his February 5, 2016 SCA, and he said he planned to “amend/file” his 2010 tax 
return this year. GE 1. He did not indicate he failed to file any other tax returns on his 
February 5, 2016 SCA. On May 2, 2016, Applicant told an Office of Personnel 
Management investigator that he had not filed his state and federal income tax return for 
tax year 2010, and he said that 2010 is the only year he did not file his tax returns. GE 3 
at 2.3 When he separated from his spouse in 2010; she took the family computer with her; 
                                            
3 Applicant’s SOR does not allege that Applicant intentionally provided false information on his 
February 5, 2016 Questionnaire for National Security Positions or security clearance application and during 
his May 2, 2016, Office of Personnel Management personnel subject interview about not filing his federal 
and state tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2012. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 
2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be 
considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
 
4                                       
 
and it contained information necessary to file his tax returns. Tr. 33. At the time of his 
hearing, he had not filed his tax returns for tax year 2010. Tr. 34. He said three times that 
he filed all of his other tax returns. Tr. 34, 36. When he was asked the fourth time about 
filing his other tax returns, he said, “[I]t was a blur, so I’m not sure, sir. I’m not sure if it’s 
federal and state or just state . . . . That’s part of the process that I need to check. I believe 
I did. Those years I do believe I did.” Tr. 37. Later, he hesitantly said he was pretty sure 
he had filed all of his tax returns, except for tax year 2010. Tr. 37-38. He did not owe any 
delinquent taxes for tax years 2011 through 2016. Tr. 34. I suggested that Applicant 
provide tax transcripts to show his tax status after 2010 and the IRS Form 1040 for tax 
year 2010. Tr. 42-43.  
 
Applicant provided information for tax years 2010 to 2016, which is depicted in the

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
                                            
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). These 
allegations will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. 
 
5                                       
 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865. 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(c) a history of not 
meeting financial obligations”; and “(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns . . . tax as required.” The record establishes AG ¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 
19(f).  
 
Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
7                                       
 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;5   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
Applicant’s finances were adversely affected when he was separated from his 
spouse in 2010, and divorced in 2011. She handled the family finances and failed to pay 
their debts. She took the family computer with her when she left, and it contained 
information necessary for him to file his tax returns. These are circumstances beyond his 
control that adversely affected his finances. Applicant has taken important steps towards 
establishing his financial responsibility. He has resolved all of his SOR debts. In 
December 2017, Applicant filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 
2010, 2011, and 2012.  No taxes were due. 
 
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.6 For purposes of this 
decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns 
against him as a federal crime. The failure to timely file federal and state income tax 
returns has security implications because: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated 
                                            
6 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make tax return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States 
v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. 
United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of 
[a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed, the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). In this 
instance, AG ¶ 20(g) applies because Applicant has filed all tax returns and paid all taxes; 
however, the timing of the filings of his tax returns is an important criteria of the analysis. 
In ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the 
grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG ¶ 20(g) applied, and noted: 
 
The timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in 
evaluating an applicant’s case for mitigation because an applicant who 
begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that 
his clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to 
follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat 
to his own interests. In this case, Applicant’s filing of his Federal income tax 
returns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background 
interview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action 
might otherwise merit. 
 
Applicant did not provide a good reason for his decisions not to file his federal and 
state tax returns on time or at least much sooner. Under all the circumstances, he failed 
to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 43 years old, and a DOD contractor has employed him as a calibration 
test equipment specialist for 14 years. He is also a union shop steward, and he represents 
about 20 employees. In 1992, he graduated from high school, and he completed three or 
four college classes. In 2013, he married. He honorably served in the Air Force from 1992 
to 1998. Applicant has excellent performance evaluations, and his career is going very 
well. He is diligent, conscientious, and detail oriented. There is no evidence of abuse of 
alcohol or use of illegal drugs. 
 
Applicant was separated from his second spouse in 2010, and they were divorced 
in 2011. His spouse handled the family finances, and she failed to pay several debts. She 
retained the family computer, and documentation to file his tax return for 2010 was 
unavailable to him for some time. These circumstances beyond his control adversely 
affected his finances, and several debts became delinquent. He is credited with resolving 
all of the SOR debts and not owing any delinquent taxes. 
 
The evidence against grant of his security clearance is more substantial. In 
December 2017, Applicant filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 
2010, 2011, and 2012, and his filings of his state and federal income tax returns for those 
three tax years were not timely. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is 
required to consider how long an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the 
IRS generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to 
begin and complete making payments.7 In this case, the IRS did not generate his tax 
                                            
7 The recent emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is 
instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
 
11                                       
 
returns, and he did not owe taxes. The primary problem here is that Applicant has known 
that he needed to file federal and state income tax returns for 2010, 2011, and 2012 for 
several years. Even though he may have known he was going to receive refunds, he had 
a legal requirement to timely file his tax returns. He may not have fully understood or 
appreciated the importance of timely filing of tax returns. His actions in December 2017 
are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns arising from his failure to timely 
file his tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. 
See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns 
lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this 
time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or 
will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
  
                                            
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited his failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax 
years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except for 
$13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of 
over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children’s 
college tuition and expenses, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the 
allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file 
tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules 
and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security 
clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. 
Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information”). Applicant’s uncorroborated 
statements that all tax returns were filed is insufficient to prove tax returns were filed. See ISCR Case No. 
15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) (citing e.g., ISCR Case No. 96-0897 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 1997) 
and reversing grant of security clearance).

Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.h:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant’s 
eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
