MASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant filed four federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016, 
but has more returns from 2008 through 2012 that have not been filed. He has 
delinquent federal and state taxes that he owes. He also owes a large student loan debt 
that became delinquent over seven years ago. His evidence in mitigation is insufficient 
to overcome the lingering security concerns arising from the guideline for financial 
considerations. Eligibility for security clearance access is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On August 12, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) for security clearance eligibility so that he could work 
for a defense contractor. He provided an interview (PSI, Item 4) to an investigator from 
the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). On October 3, 2017, The Department of 
Defense (DOD) could not make the necessary affirmative finding to grant Applicant’s 
security clearance and issued an SOR to him detailing security reasons under the 
financial considerations guideline (Guideline F).   The action was taken under Executive 
Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
  2 
 
1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017.  
 
Applicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on November 22, 2017. He 
elected to have his case decided on a written record instead of a hearing. The 
Government sent a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM) (the Government’s 
evidence in support of the allegations in the SOR) to Applicant on December 11, 2017. 
Applicant received the FORM on December 18, 2017. The Government advised 
Applicant that he could either file objections, furnish explanations, submit additional 
material, or take advantage of all three options within 30 days of receiving the FORM. 
Applicant’s response was received by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) on January 11, 2018. DOHA assigned the case file to me on February 14, 
2018.  
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
 In a footnote on the first page of the FORM, Department Counsel informed 
Applicant that his May 2017 PSI would be excluded from evidence if he objected to the 
exhibit. Alternatively, Department counsel advised him that he could correct, update, or 
modify the exhibit to improve its clarity or accuracy. Applicant did not object, and the 
exhibit is admitted into evidence. See, E3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5220.6, page 52.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
The SOR 1.a and 1.b allege that Applicant did not file federal and state tax 
returns for tax years 2013 through 2016. SOR 1.c alleges that he has a delinquent 
student loan debt. In his November 2017 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted he had 
not filed the tax returns and that he owed the student loan. In attachments to his 
answer, he provided proof the returns were filed. A review of the federal and state tax 
returns shows that the 2016 returns were filed in May 2017 (adjusted gross federal 
income: $51,329); the federal and state returns for 2015 (adjusted gross federal income: 
$30,788) were filed in October 2017;1 the federal and state tax returns for 2014 
(adjusted gross federal income: $30,372) were filed in October 2017; and the federal 
and state tax returns for 2013 (adjusted gross federal income: $17,456) were filed in 
October 2017. In February 2015, Applicant’s wages were garnished to satisfy the 
delinquent state taxes he owed for tax year 2013. Applicant intended to have a payment 
plan in place by November 6, 2017 to pay off the delinquent federal taxes. He provided 
an undated payment plan with the student loan collection agency (SOR 1.c) indicating a 
future payment schedule of $5 a month from October 2017 through June 2018. There is 
no documentation verifying that payments were made under the plan. He owes the 
university collection agency $5,892 (unalleged), and the student loan agency $82,711 
                                            
1 The 2015 state tax return was filed initially in May 2017, but refiled in October 2017 because 
Applicant claims his tax preparer did not inform him where his signature was to be entered on the return. 
(Answer to SOR) 
  3 
 
(SOR 1.c). The student loan became delinquent in April 2010. (Item 4 at 7-8; answer to 
SOR, with attachments; response to FORM) 
 
 Applicant is 36 years old and single. He received a bachelor’s degree in May 
2004. After college, he had several jobs: he worked as a security officer and 
surveillance operator in the casino industry; he was a teacher and sales consultant. 
Between 2012 and 2016, he was a part-time delivery driver. From September 2013 to 
the present, Applicant has been employed as an attendance officer for a school system. 
In July 2016, he began working for a defense contractor as a security officer. Though 
his April 2016 e-QIP shows no periods of unemployment between December 2005 and 
the present, Applicant indicated in his May 2017 PSI that he was unemployed from 
August to September 2009. (GE 1 at 7-9, 10-18; GE 4 at 5) 
 
 In his April 2016 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed only one debt, a delinquent car loan 
which he brought to a current status in three months. (GE 1 at 28-30) In his May 2017 
PSI, Applicant was unable to explain why he did not reveal his tax issues or his 
delinquent student loan in his April 2016 e-QIP. He indicated that he did not file his 
federal and state taxes for 2013 through 2016 because he was working so much and 
did not have time to file the returns. He also mentioned his financial problems 
materialized because of inadequate earnings. In February 2015, Applicant’s wages 
were garnished by the state tax agency to satisfy a tax lien for taxes due for 2013. (SOR 
1. b) In July 2015, the tax lien was satisfied.  Applicant claimed that he had been 
making $50 monthly payments on an unalleged university student loan since April 2017. 
He also intended to double his payments to the university to $100 a month and begin 
payments of $100 a month to the collection agency for the government student loan. 
(SOR 1.c) (GE 1 at 28; GE 4 at 7-9) No proof of payments was submitted to support his 
monthly payment claims. 
 
In the conclusion section of Applicant’s November 2017 answer to the SOR at 
#6, he listed personal issues during the 2013 through 2016 period that got in the way of 
handling his financial obligations: dealing with the estate of his deceased mother; car 
problems; and weather-related home repairs. (Answer to SOR, attachments) 
 
 In his January 2018 response to the FORM, Applicant expanded upon his earlier 
explanations for his financial problems. First, he identified the emotional toll connected 
to adjusting to his parent’s deaths and expense of the threatened foreclosure of his 
mother’s home. No dates were given for his parent’s death or the expense of saving the 
home from the foreclosure. He mentioned a burglary and bad weather that resulted in 
damage to his mother’s home, but he provided no dates for the burglary and the bad 
weather that caused damage. No estimates of damage were disclosed either. Applicant 
stated that he inherited his parent’s home. His father passed away some time before 
August 2009 because Applicant indicated that he was receiving his father’s social 
security during his unemployment between August and September 2009. (GE 1 at 51; 
GE 4 at 4-5, 9; response to SOR) 
 
  4 
 
 Applicant also explained that he met an advisor after beginning his new 
employment with the defense contractor in July 2016.  The advisor’s words of 
encouragement helped Applicant understand what is important in life while 
strengthening his character. On December 17 and December 20, 2017, Applicant 
provided proof of three payments totaling $130 against the balance he owes in 
delinquent state taxes. On December 6, 2017, Applicant provided proof of paying $50 to 
the university for the student loan account. On December 11, 2017, he made the first $5 
payment to the student loan collection agency for the $82,000 loan. On December 20, 
2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) responded to Applicant’s request to establish 
a repayment plan. The IRS noted that the repayment plan would address delinquent 
federal taxes for tax years from 2008 through 2016.2 The IRS provided detailed 
requirements of a prospective payment plan. The installment agreement was to begin in 
February 2018, with payments of $130 dollars a month. (Response to FORM, 
attachments)  Applicant provided no documentation of action taken to address his state 
taxes for year 2014, 2015, and 2016.  
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant indicated that four character references were attached to his answer to 
the SOR. There are only two references in the court file. The first statement is dated 
October 19, 2017, and was written by a friend of eight years who complimented 
Applicant’s judgment in making correct decisions. He is active in community service and 
vice president of a fraternity’s local chapter. He is affiliated with an organization that 
provides college scholarships to worthy high school students. In an undated character 
assessment, a friend of four years is impressed with Applicant’s strong character and 
ethics. In addition to keen leadership skills, the second reference considers Applicant to 
be honest, dedicated, and dependable. (Answer to FORM, two character references) 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines and all available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a 
decision. These guidelines, which are flexible rules of law, are applied together with 
common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. The protection of 
the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(d) requires that “[a]ny 
doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be 
resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
                                            
2 The December 2017 IRS payment plan confirms that Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes 
for tax years 2008 through 2016. He admitted that in addition to the SOR 1.c student loan, he also owes a 
student loan to the university where he received his bachelor’s degree. This additional adverse evidence 
is not alleged in the SOR.  Following Appeal Board precedent, I will consider the evidence in assessing 
Applicant’s case in mitigation, extenuation, or changed circumstances, and in evaluating the overall 
record under the whole-person concept. See ISCR Case No. 08-09232 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 9, 2010). 
  5 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by 
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial 
distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, 
other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health 
conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known 
sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal 
activity, including espionage. 
 
AG ¶ 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying 
include: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local        
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax as required. 
 
 When the SOR was published in October 2017, the government’s security 
investigation showed that Applicant had not filed his federal and state tax returns for 
2013 through 2016. (SOR 1. a and 1. b) To Applicant’s credit, he filed his 2016 federal 
and state tax returns in May 2017, before the SOR was issued, even though the returns 
were filed late. The student loan became delinquent in April 2010. (SOR 1.c) AG ¶¶ 
19(a), 19(c), 19(f) apply. 
 
AG ¶ 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
  6 
 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or 
identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the 
circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for 
the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-
profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that 
the problem is being resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
 Based on Applicant’s failure to file his federal and state 2013 through 2015 tax 
returns until October 2017, and, except for the garnishment to satisfy his 2013 state 
taxes, the lack of evidence indicating that he paid federal and state taxes from 2008 
through 2016, I infer that he did not file his federal returns from 2008 through 2012. 
Applicant still owes over $85,000 for the delinquent student loans. No mitigation is 
available under AG ¶ 20(a). 
 
 Applicant discussed the emotional problems he had in adjusting to his parent’s 
medical problems and their deaths. He provided no information about when they died. 
There is no indication when his mother passed. His father must have died some time 
before August 2009 because Applicant indicated that he was receiving his father’s 
social security during his unemployment between August and September 2009. No date 
was given for when the threatened foreclosure occurred and the cost to save his 
mother’s house.  Applicant did not provide dates for when the house burglary and bad 
weather occurred and the cost to repair the house. In sum, Applicant receives scant 
mitigation under AG ¶ 20(b) because of a lack of detailed supporting evidence about 
unforeseen events and how they sparked or exacerbated his financial problems. 
  
 Applicant has never had financial counseling. There is no track record of 
evidence that persuasively shows that the student loan debts are being resolved or 
under control. Though Applicant set up a payment plan (SOR 1.c) to begin in October 
2017, he did not make his first $5 payment until December 2017. He did not make any 
documented payments on the unlisted university debt until December 2017. AG ¶ 20(c) 
is not applicable. Applicant is entitled to limited mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) because the 
payments on the student loans were not made until December 2017, after he received 
  7 
 
the FORM, and more than seven years after the student loan (SOR 1.c) became 
delinquent.  
 
Applicant provided some evidence of filing federal and state tax returns for 2013 
through 2016. He receives no mitigation for paying his 2013 state taxes because the 
delinquent taxes were paid by garnishment of Applicant’s wages. There is no evidence 
that Applicant filed the unalleged federal and state tax returns for 2008 through 2012. 
He provided no evidence of paying his federal or state taxes for 2008 through 2016. On 
balance, Applicant receives limited mitigation under AG ¶ 20(g).  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
I have examined the evidence under the guideline for financial considerations in 
the context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent 
to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the 
motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, 
exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for 
access to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
 Applicant is 36 years and single. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2004. The 
record shows that he exercises good judgment in making his decisions. He is active in 
the community and participates in an organization that provides scholarships to 
deserving high school students. He is considered a leader who is honest and 
dependable. 
 
 The foregoing favorable evidence is insufficient to support Applicant’s security 
clearance application. When he completed his April 2016 e-QIP, the record suggests 
that he knew he had tax issues and a delinquent student loan. But he only disclosed a 
debt that he returned to a current status. When the OPM investigator asked him in May 
2017 why he did not reveal the tax and student loan issues on the April security form, 
he could not give a reason for the omission.  
 
 In his May 2017 PSI, he indicated that he had made payments on the student 
loan debts. However, the first documented payments on the debts were more than six 
months later in December 2017 and two months after he received the SOR. Given the 
timing of his filing of the tax returns and payments on the student loan debts, Applicant’s 
  8 
 
primary motive for the action was to increase his chances of obtaining a security 
clearance. He should have been more proactive in addressing his federal tax issues 
instead of waiting until December 2017 to negotiate a payment agreement with the IRS. 
He provided no documentation of steps taken to resolve his delinquent state taxes for 
2014-2016. Having considered the entire record from an overall common-sense point of 
view, Applicant’s ongoing serious financial and tax problems have not been mitigated.   
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraph 1.a-1.c:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
