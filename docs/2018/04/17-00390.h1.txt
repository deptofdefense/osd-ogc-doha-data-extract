GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 20, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG).1 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on April 18, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 4, 2017. 
                                                          
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
January 4, 2018, scheduling the hearing for January 25, 2018. I convened the hearing 
as scheduled. 
  
The Government’s exhibit list and discovery letter were appended to the record 
as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted 
in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) 
A through O, which were admitted in evidence without objection.  
 
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until February 8, 2018. He timely provided additional documentation, which 
I marked as AE P and admitted in evidence without objection. I appended to the record 
as HE III an email from Department Counsel indicating he did not have any objection to 
AE P. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 1, 2018.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations.2 He is 38 years old. As of his 
January 2016 security clearance application, he had never been married and was 
cohabitating with his girlfriend as of March 2015. He has a minor child who lives with 
them. He graduated from high school in 1998 and he earned a bachelor’s degree in 
2002 and a master’s degree in 2008. He has owned his home since January 2013.3 
 
 Applicant has worked as a network administrator for a defense contractor since 
late 2017. He worked for prior defense contractors since earning his bachelor’s degree 
in 2002. He was briefly unemployed from September to October 2009 and September to 
October 2012. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 2007.4 
 
 The SOR alleges 10 delinquent consumer debts for $24,784 and 7 delinquent 
medical debts for $1,822. The SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s 
admissions and credit reports from April 2016, January 2017, and December 2017. 
Applicant also listed his delinquent debts in his January 2016 security clearance 
application.5  
 
 Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to purchasing a home in January 2013. 
He was unprepared for the costs associated with home ownership and he became 
financially overextended. His expectation that his then-fiancé would financially 
contribute did not come to fruition, as she did not work outside of the home for one year 
after their child was born in 2012. In addition, after he and his then-fiancé ended their 
relationship in 2015, he was obligated to pay her $775 monthly in child support. He also

paid $8,000 towards costs associated with his parents’ illnesses and passing in 2015, 
and in 2016. He acknowledged that he procrastinated in paying his debts during this 
period because he lacked the income to do so.6 
 
 Prior to receiving the SOR, Applicant started resolving his delinquent debts. He 
withdrew $34,700 from his 401(k) between 2016 and 2017 to do so. He testified that he 
claimed the withdrawals on his tax returns, as required, and paid the applicable taxes 
and penalties, of which $3,000 remained as of the hearing for which he was paying. He 
deliberately missed three mortgage payments during this period so that he could claim 
the hardship necessary to permit the withdrawals, but he was current on his mortgage 
as of the hearing. Upon receiving the SOR and with a friend’s assistance, he pulled a 
copy of his credit report and called his creditors to resolve any remaining delinquent 
accounts, to include some not alleged in the SOR. He used money from his 401(k) 
withdrawals and his tax refunds to settle a number of his outstanding accounts. He also 
started writing letters to his creditors to ask them to remove any previously delinquent 
accounts that he had resolved from his credit report. He considered but elected not to 
pursue bankruptcy. He did not receive financial counseling.7 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d are for two credit cards with the same creditor. Concerning 
SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant provided documentation showing that he settled the outstanding 
$6,495 balance for $4,546 in January 2018, for which three payments of $1,515 were 
due monthly between January and March 2018. He testified that he made the first 
$1,500 payment prior to the hearing and he expected to make the remaining two 
payments within a month of the hearing. Upon doing so, he then expected to resolve 
SOR ¶ 1.d. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his payments towards 
SOR ¶ 1.a or his attempts at resolving SOR ¶ 1.d. Both accounts are reported on his 
December 2017 credit report.8 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b is for a credit card. Applicant provided documentation reflecting that 
he settled this debt through a $2,500 payment to the creditor in March 2017. His 
December 2017 credit report reflects that this account was settled, paid, and carries a 
zero balance.9  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c is for a credit card. Applicant provided documentation reflecting that 
he settled this debt through a $1,200 payment to the creditor in March 2017. His 
December 2017 credit report reflects that the account was settled, paid, and carries a 
zero balance.10

 SOR ¶ 1.e is for a store credit card. Applicant testified that he made a $972 
payment to resolve this debt and he expected to receive documentation from the 
creditor reflecting such. The debt was no longer reported on the December 2017 credit 
report.11  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f is for a store credit card. Applicant provided documentation to show 
that he made payments totaling $998 and resolved this debt as of December 2017.12 
  
 SOR ¶ 1.g is for a store credit card. Applicant provided a March 2017 letter from 
the creditor reflecting that he settled the outstanding $1,341 balance for $805, for which 
payment was due. His December 2017 credit report reflects that the account was 
settled and carries a zero balance.13  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.j are for a pre-existing security system for Applicant’s home 
that was sold to him when he purchased the home. He testified that he believed he only 
had one account with this creditor, and the creditor continued to charge him without 
notice after it discontinued the service. He also testified that he settled the debt. He 
provided documentation from the creditor reflecting that Applicant paid $1,000 towards 
his account with this creditor in April 2017, and he had a zero balance as of January 
2018.14   
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i is a debt for a prior apartment rental. Applicant provided 
documentation to show that he settled the debt for $447 and the account had a zero 
balance as of December 2017.15 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.k through 1.p are medical debts totaling $800. Applicant was 
uninsured for a brief period in 2015. He acknowledged that he also handled his medical 
debts carelessly. Prior to receiving the SOR, he pulled a copy of his credit report and 
discovered additional medical debts. He testified that he subsequently satisfied all of his 
delinquent medical debts. He provided documentation reflecting that he resolved the 
outstanding medical debts for SOR ¶¶ 1.k through 1.n in January 2018. He also 
provided documentation to show that he paid $514 in delinquent medical debt in 
January 2018 with a creditor not alleged in the SOR, and he paid $41 in December 
2017 to resolve another outstanding medical debt not alleged in the SOR. His 
December 2017 credit report reflects only one outstanding medical debt for $40, and it 
does not report SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p. Applicant testified that he established a medical 
savings account to ensure prompt resolution of his medical bills in the future.16

 Since obtaining his current job in late 2017, Applicant has earned an annual 
salary of $115,000. He previously earned $80,000 annually until late 2012, and $90,000 
annually from late 2012 to late 2017. In addition, since he and his girlfriend reconciled, 
he was no longer obligated to pay his girlfriend $775 monthly in child support as of mid-
2017. He lives within his means. Aside from staying current on his mortgage, he paid 
the balance on his truck and he sold his other car. He uses only one credit card, for 
which he has scheduled automatic payments. He has $6,000 in his checking account, 
some money in investment accounts, and he intends to start setting aside money in his 
401(k). He is diligent in monitoring his credit report and intent on rebuilding his credit. 
Other than SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d, and a non-SOR medical debt for $40, Applicant does 
not have any other outstanding debts reported on his December 2017 credit report.17    
 
Applicant testified that he comes from a military family and he is devoted to 
protecting our nation’s defense. He also testified that he disclosed his financial issues to 
his employer. He provided a letter from his supervisor, who attested to Applicant’s 
trustworthiness and commendable performance.18 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.

18 Tr. at 76, 78-79; AE P.

 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
7 
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 Applicant’s financial problems started after he purchased his home in January 
2013, as he was unprepared for all of the costs associated with home ownership. In 
addition, his expectation that his then-fiancé would financially contribute did not come to 
fruition, and after they ended their relationship in 2015 he was obligated to pay her $775 
monthly in child support. He also paid $8,000 towards costs associated with his parents’ 
illnesses and passing in 2015 and 2016. However, Applicant acknowledged that he also 
procrastinated in paying his debts during this period and he handled his medical debts 
carelessly. As such, AG ¶ 20(b) only partially applies. 
 
 Since 2013, Applicant has made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent 
debts. He demonstrated that he resolved all of his delinquent debts, with the exception 
of SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d, and a $40 non-SOR medical debt. He testified that he was 
resolving SOR ¶ 1.a, after which time he intended to resolve SOR ¶ 1.d. He also 
testified that he was diligent about monitoring his credit report.  
  
  A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an 
individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged 
in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she 
need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
Applicant has not incurred additional delinquent debts and he has resolved a majority of 
his debts. While he has a few unresolved SOR debts remaining, he has demonstrated a 
good-faith effort and he has the means to continue to resolve them. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 
20(d) are applicable.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
 
8 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant resolved a majority of his 
debts. While he has a few unresolved SOR debts remaining, he credibly testified at 
hearing and there is sufficient evidence to show that he is committed to resolving them.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.p:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
