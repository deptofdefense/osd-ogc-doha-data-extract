KILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated foreign influence and financial considerations security 
concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 5, 2014. 
On March 19, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline B, foreign influence, and Guideline F, financial considerations. The 
DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on 
September 1, 2006.

 On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence signed Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), implementing new AGs effective within the DOD 
on June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have applied the June 8, 2017 AGs in this decision.1  
 
Applicant answered the SOR on May 2, 2016, admitting all of the SOR 
allegations except for the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.g, and 2.i, which he denied. 
Applicant also provided amplifying explanations and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2017. The Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for October 30, 2017. However, that hearing was cancelled because 
Applicant engaged counsel who requested a continuance. DOHA issued a new notice 
scheduling the hearing for March 29, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  
 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence without 
objection. (Tr. 14) At the hearing, Applicant testified, and presented testimony from two 
witnesses, including his wife. Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) 1.a through 1.j, and AE 2 through 
6, were admitted without objection. AE 1 is comprised of a five-page affidavit signed by 
Applicant on March 20, 2018. It also includes several sub-exhibits including debt relief 
agency documents; credit-card letter; pocket sense article; cell-hone mobility 
documents; insurance documents; apartment documents; and Applicant’s wife’s 
application for citizenship. AE 1 also includes 10 character reference letters and several 
certificates of appreciation; a budget; a document reflecting payment on SOR ¶ 2.e 
(telecommunications provider) and medical records pertaining to Applicant’s father-in 
law.2 DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 11, 2018.   
 
Request for Administrative Notice 
 
Department Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice 
of certain facts about the Philippines. The request and the attached source documents 
were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE 
1).  
 
The request listed supporting documents to show detail and context for those 
facts. AG ¶ 6, Foreign Influence, provides, “Adjudication under this Guideline can and 
should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or 
financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether 
the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected 
information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.” A risk assessment in this case 
necessitates administrative notice of facts concerning the Philippines.  
 
Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for 
administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 
                                                          
1 Although I have decided this case under the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, I also 
considered the case under the former AG effective on September 1, 2006, and my decision would be the 
same under either AG.

2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  
Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR 
proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. 
See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types 
of facts for administrative notice).  
 
Applicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts 
contained in the HE 1 source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The 
source documents were provided by the U.S. Department of State. The facts are 
summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. However, of 
particular note, are the following salient facts from HE 1: 
 
The Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral 
legislature. However, dynastic political families continued to monopolize elective offices 
at the national and local level. There remains widespread official corruption and abuse 
of power. The most significant human rights issues over the last few years were killings 
allegedly undertaken by vigilantes, security forces and insurgents; apparent disregard 
for human rights and due process; and a weak and overburdened criminal justice 
system, feeble prosecutions, and poor cooperation between police and investigators. 
Additional human rights problems include: torture and abuse of prisoners and detainees 
by security forces; harassment of political activists; warrantless arrests; lengthy pre trial 
detentions; overcrowded prisons; killings of journalists; abuse against women and 
children; gender identity discrimination; and child labor.  
 
Terrorist organizations engaged in kidnappings for ransom and bombings of 
civilian targets and operated shadow governments in areas that they controlled. 
Conflicts ensued between the government and Muslim separatists and communist 
insurgents. The emergence of Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) – affiliated extremist 
groups; persistent kidnappings by the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), attacks on government 
forces, and bombings, all indicated that violent extremism and terrorism remained a 
problem. The U.S. Department of State advises all U.S. citizens contemplating travel to 
the Philippines to exercise increased caution due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. 
U.S. citizens are specifically advised to not travel to Sulu Archipelago, including the 
southern Sulu Sea, and Marawi City, and there remains a state of national emergency 
in Mindanao. Terrorist and armed groups continue to conduct kidnappings, bombings, 
and other attacks targeting U.S. citizens, foreigners, civilians, government facilities and 
security forces.
