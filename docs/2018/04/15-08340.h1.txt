Decision 
______________ 
 
 
 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny her eligibility for 
access to classified information. Applicant mitigated the security concern raised by her 
criminal conduct. She failed, however, to mitigate the security concern raised by her 
problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on October 14, 2014. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On June 16, 2016, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
2 
 
the action under the security guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations 
and Guideline J for criminal conduct. Applicant answered the SOR on July 15, 2016, and 
requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.   
 
On June 26 2017, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on the same day. She was given 30 days 
to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s 
evidence. Applicant received the FORM on June 28, 2017. She responded to the FORM 
on September 7, 2017. The case was assigned to me on December 18, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
Included in the FORM were seven items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. Exhibit 7 is a report of investigation (ROI) 
summarizing Applicant’s interview that took place during the January 2015 background 
investigation. The ROI is not authenticated, as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.3 
Department Counsel’s written brief includes a footnote advising Applicant that the 
summary was not authenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the 
authentication requirement. The footnote explains the concepts of authentication and 
waiver. In a case such as this, where Applicant has responded to the FORM, it is fair to 
conclude that Applicant read the footnote, understood it, and chose not to object to the 
ROI. The ROI is, therefore, admissible. GE 1 through 7 are admitted into evidence without 
objection.  
 
Included with Applicant’s response to the FORM were three documents, which I 
marked as Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through C, and which are admitted into evidence 
without objection.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). DOD CAF adjudicators reviewed this case 
using the previous version of the adjudicative guidelines, dated September 1, 2006, which were in effect at 
the time. My decision and formal findings under the revised Guidelines F and J would not be different under 
the 2006 Guidelines F and J.  
  
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation  
that are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 34 years old, a high school graduate who has just one class to 
complete to earn her degree in Mechanical Engineering. She has never married and has 
no children. Since July 2014, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor.4 
 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $23,171.5 
Applicant denies the debts alleged in SOR ⁋⁋ 1.a, b, e, h through l and n, saying that they 
have zero balances.6 Except for the debts alleged in SOR ⁋⁋ 1.h. 1.i, and 1.l, Applicant 
has not provided any documentation showing zero balances for those debts.7 Moreover, 
the record still shows those debts as unresolved.8 For each debt alleged in SOR ⁋⁋ 1.c, 
d, f, g, and m, Applicant stated that she was “trying to resolve” them.9 In her response to 
the FORM, Applicant submitted a document showing monthly payments to the servicer 
of her two educational loans alleged in SOR ⁋⁋ 1.h and 1.i. This shows the resolution of 
those two debts.10 In sum, Applicant has documented the resolution of three of the SOR 
debts totaling $5,403. That leaves $17,768 unresolved. During her background interview, 
Applicant referred to her employment hours being cut and receiving less student 
assistance in August 2012.11 
 
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged that in March 2013 Applicant was arrested 
and charged with driving on a suspended license, lack of insurance, failure to yield or 
stop, and was issued a bench warrant for failure to appear.12 Applicant admitted those 
allegations.13 In her response to the FORM, Applicant explained that she was in an 
automobile accident in 2007 and did not know until her 2013 arrest that she was driving 
on a suspended license. She further explained that she has hired an attorney to resolve 
her case and regain her driving privileges.14 The record shows that the 2013 arrest was

Law and Policies 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.16 As noted by the 
Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”17 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.18 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.19 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.20 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.21 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.22 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.23

In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.24 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.25 
 
Discussion 
  
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,26 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information . . . .27 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying  
conditions: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
  In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following mitigating conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,

clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.   
 
As noted, Applicant has admitted 11 unresolved debts totaling $17,768.  The 
evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial history 
which persists to this day. Security concerns are raised under AG ¶¶ 19(a) and (c).  The 
next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply.28 
 
Since there are 11 unresolved debts that persist to this day, they are neither 
infrequent, nor are they aged. Thus, AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
I have reviewed the record thoroughly and could find little evidence of what caused 
Applicant’s delinquencies. There is, however, a reference by Applicant during her 
background interview that in August 2012 her employer cut back on her hours, and she 
received less student aid. Even if I credit those circumstance as being largely beyond her 
control under AG ¶ 20(b), there remains the question whether Applicant acted responsibly 
under those circumstances.  Unfortunately, Applicant has not documented what she has 
done to attempt to resolve those 11 debts. The Appeal Board has previously noted that it 
is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the 
satisfaction or resolution of individual debts.29 AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply. For the same 
reason, AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply. 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct 
 
 Applicant’s traffic arrest in March 2013 raises a criminal conduct security concern, 
which is detailed in AG ¶ 30: 
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or 
willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
 
 I have considered the disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 31, and the following 
applies: 
  
(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, 
and matters of official record) of criminal conduct . . . . 
 
                                                          
28 Applicant has documented the resolution of SOR ⁋⁋ 1.h, i, and l. Those debts are mitigated under AG ¶ 
20(d).  
 
29 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10310 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-17520 at 2 (App. 
Bd. Sep. 20, 2007). 
 
7 
 
Applicant’s admission of her arrest triggers AG ¶ 31(b). The question is whether 
Applicant has mitigated the security concern raised by her criminal conduct.  
 
 Under AG ¶ 32, the following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: 
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment.  
 
Applicant’s arrest for a minor traffic violation occurred over five years ago. The 
arrest triggered a violation of driving while on a suspended license, a suspension caused 
by an accident Applicant had in 2007, 11 years ago, and a suspension Applicant was 
unaware of in 2013. She has hired an attorney to resolve this matter.  Applicant’s arrest 
in March 2013 is mitigated under AG ¶ 32(a).   
 
The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.30 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to meet her ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
     Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                  Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.h-1.i:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.j-1.k:              Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.l:     For Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.m-1.n:    Against Applicant  
 
  Paragraph 2, Guideline J:     For Applicant  
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
                                                          
30 AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6).

     Conclusion 
  
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
