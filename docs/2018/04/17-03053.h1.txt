Statement of the Case 
 
On September 28, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. Applicant responded to the SOR on October 18, 2017, and requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on November 16, 2017. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 18, 2017, 
scheduling the hearing for January 30, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were 
admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 7, 
2018.

Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a 59-year-old owner of a company that does business on a military 
installation. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held for many years. 
He has an associate’s degree. He married in 1981 and divorced in 2001. He married 
again in 2002 and divorced in 2010. He married for the third time in 2017. He has four 
adult children and three adult stepchildren.1 
 
 Applicant has owned a small company since 1982. He did not pay all the 
business and personal taxes owed when they were due for the following tax years: 
2002, 2003, 2005 through 2012, and 2014. The business taxes included payroll taxes 
withheld from employees’ pay but not paid to the IRS.2 The IRS filed the following 
federal tax liens against the company:  
 
 $2,798 for tax years 2005 through 2007 - filed in 2012 and released in March 
2014;  
 
 $6,736 for tax years 2005 and 2011 - filed in 2012 and released in April 2015;  
 
 $2,340 for tax year 2010 - filed in 2013 and released in April 2015;  
 
 $125,934 for tax years 2007 through 2009 - filed in 2013 and released in January 
2016; and  
 
 $4,635 for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2014 - filed in 2015 and released in 
January 2016.3 
 
The IRS filed the following federal tax liens against Applicant personally:  
 
 $73,082 for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2008 - filed in 2010 and released in 
September 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c);  
 
 $31,534 for tax years 2008 and 2009 - filed in 2013 and released in November 
2017 (SOR ¶ 1.d); 
 
 $84,489 for indeterminate tax years - filed in 2013 - unreleased (SOR ¶ 1.e); 
 
                                                          
1 Tr. at 23-24, 27-28, 35; GE 1.  
 
2 Tr. at 18-21, 28-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6; AE B. The SOR did not allege the business 
taxes. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be 
considered when assessing Applicant’s overall financial situation, in the application of mitigating 
conditions, and during the whole-person analysis.

 $115,913 for indeterminate tax years - filed in 2013 - unreleased (SOR ¶ 1.b); 
and 
 
 $55,757 for indeterminate tax years - filed in 2013 - unreleased (SOR ¶ 1.a).4 
 
 Applicant stated that he “had a bad period of time in [his] life going through a 
divorce, and really didn’t care about a lot of things and two of them were [his] personal 
and business taxes.” He stated that he realized that he needed to get his life in order 
and he went to the IRS and set up a payment plan. The IRS wanted the business taxes 
paid first. In 2013, he started paying the business taxes through an installment 
agreement with the IRS. He completed paying those taxes in 2016, and the liens 
against his company were released.5  
 
 In April 2016, the IRS approved a $3,363 per month installment agreement to 
pay the personal taxes. The amount owed at that time, with interest and penalties, was 
$401,414. Applicant made most of the payments on a timely basis. He obtained a new 
installment agreement with monthly payments of $4,220. The balance owed as of 
January 2018 was $354,177. He hopes to take out a business loan and a mortgage 
loan on his house to pay his taxes.6 
 
Applicant submitted numerous letters attesting to his honesty, dependability, high 
moral character, work ethic, professionalism, trustworthiness, loyalty, dedication, and 
integrity.7 
 
Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became 
effective on June 8, 2017. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
                                                          
4 Tr. at 34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-6; AE B.  
 
5 Tr. at 18-21, 24, 30-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE B.  
 
6 Tr. at 21-23, 32-33, 39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A-D.  
 
7 AE D.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
 
5 
 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant did not pay his federal income taxes for years. The evidence is 
sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant stated that he “had a bad period of time in [his] life going through a 
divorce, and really didn’t care about a lot of things and two of them were [his] personal 
and business taxes.” His first divorce was in 2001, but he did not pay his taxes for tax 
 
6 
 
years 2002, 2003, 2005 through 2012, and 2014. He is credited with starting to resolve 
his back taxes in 2013. He paid his business taxes first, and more than $142,000 in 
business tax liens were released. He has been paying his personal income taxes since 
2016. The tax liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($73,082) and 1.d ($31,534) have been 
released. Those allegations are mitigated. Those payments appear impressive; 
however, as of January 2018, Applicant still owed the IRS more than $350,000. 
 
 Applicant’s repeated failure to fulfill his tax obligations suggests that he does not 
possess the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted 
access to classified information and that he has a problem with complying with well-
established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-04437 
at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016).  
 
There is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant’s financial 
problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. His financial issues are recent and 
ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) are not applicable. AG ¶¶ 20(d) and 20(g) are 
partially applicable, but they are insufficient to mitigate the judgment issues raised by 
Applicant’s years of shirking his responsibility to pay his taxes.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant’s favorable 
character evidence. 
  
 
7 
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c-1.d:   For Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for 
a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
