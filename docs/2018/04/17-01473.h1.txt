Decision 
______________ 
 
MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised 
by his tax-related financial problems and deliberate falsification of his security clearance 
application (SCA). Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 2, 2017, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under the financial considerations and 
personal conduct guidelines. Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. 
 
 On April 12, 2018, a date mutually agreed to by the parties, a hearing was held. 
Applicant testified at the hearing. Government Exhibits 1 – 3 and Applicant’s Exhibits A – 
E were admitted into the administrative record without objection. (Applicant’s objection to 
Exhibit 4 for identification was sustained.) The transcript of the hearing was received on 
April 20, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is married with three adult children. He served in the U.S. military for 20 
years from 1959 to 1979, and has worked as a federal contractor since 2003. His income 
tax returns for 2015 and 2016 reflect adjusted gross income of over $225,000. As of 
 
2 
August 2017, Applicant and his wife’s monthly net income exceeded $8,000, and they 
owned four cars. He has held a security clearance for several years.1  
 
In 2009, the IRS filed tax liens totaling over $100,000 for unpaid federal taxes, 
including for tax years 1996 and 1997. Applicant states that the liens and the underlying 
tax debts are no longer collectible.2  
 
Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 
through 2015. He was embroiled in a court proceeding with the IRS related to deductions 
he claimed on his 2009 tax return for his daughter’s inpatient drug rehabilitation program. 
The case was resolved in his favor in approximately May 2016. He was aware that he 
was required to file his 2012 – 2015 returns while the tax case was ongoing, but made 
the conscious decision not to file them. He also did not file his 2011 tax return on time. 
He estimates owing the IRS approximately $100,000 for tax years 2011 through 2016.3 
 
In August 2017, Applicant filed his overdue tax returns for tax years 2011 – 2015. 
He also submitted a request for an installment agreement. The following month, the IRS 
replied that they had received Applicant’s request for an installment agreement to resolve 
his outstanding tax debt for tax years 2011 – 2016, but they could not consider his request 
because they needed to process the information he had supplied. He testified that he has 
yet to hear back from the IRS.4  
 
In April 2015, Applicant submitted an SCA. In response to questions about his 
financial record, Applicant reported that his wages were garnished by the IRS for a 
$100,000 tax debt for “underpayment of self employment taxes while an independent 
consultant in the mid 90s.” He stated that the matter was closed, and “matter has been 
completely resolved.”5 He did not report any other financial problems. He did not disclose 
his failure to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 and 2013. Applicant did 
not report this negative financial information (unfiled federal income tax returns and 
unpaid taxes) on his SCA, because he was worried it would adversely impact his security 
clearance eligibility. He had gone through a background investigation in connection with 
another federal contracting position in 2012 or 2013, and was told that his then tax issues 
could negatively impact his clearance eligibility. Instead of addressing and resolving the 
tax issues at that time, Applicant changed jobs and obtained a contract position with a 
different government agency.6 Applicant testified as follows regarding his decision not to 
report his tax issues on his 2015 SCA:

Applicant: . . . I did not declare [on the SCA] the fact that I owed the taxes 
because I went through an iteration with the OPM [Office of Personnel 
Management] back in 2012/2013 sometime, when I was working for the 
[another federal agency]. And they did the investigation, at that time I had 
several bills on my credit report, and some tax things that were addressed. 
And they, at that time, I went ahead and paid off all the bills. I think all but 
one. And then they insisted that I had to get my resolution done with the 
IRS. Didn't have to necessarily pay them, but I had to resolve it. . . .  And I 
decided, no. I'm not going to go ahead and pay off what turned out to be 
about a $20,000, almost $20,000 difference. To be able to get this 
clearance. So, I basically said, no. Left the job with the [federal agency]. 
Took one with the Secretary of [military department], which was a much 
more secured effort, they had a much bigger budget up there. And 
continued to work for my company [as a federal contractor]. 
 
Judge: All right, so let me see if I get this right. Back in 2012/2013, you went 
through an OPM investigation which found that you had several outstanding 
delinquent debts as well as some tax issues? 
 
Applicant: Yes. 
 
Judge: Okay. You were told you needed to resolve those issues in order to 
get a security clearance. Is that accurate? 
 
Applicant: Yes. 
 
Judge: You went ahead and paid a bunch of those delinquent debts. 
 
Applicant: Yes. 
 
Judge: They also wanted you to resolve the IRS tax issue, but you decided 
not to because it was a big tax debt. 
 
Applicant: It would have been a big tax debt. 
 
Judge: So then you left that job, and went to another job with (military 
department)? 
 
Applicant: Yes. 
 
Judge: . . . . So then when you went to fill out your security clearance 
application in 2015 and they asked you about whether you failed to file or 
pay federal, state taxes? You entered, no. And is that because you knew 
this was an issue? 
 
Applicant: Yes.7

Law, Policies, and Regulations 
 
This case is decided under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which 
became effective on June 8, 2017. ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 
2003) (security clearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy and standards). 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Instead, persons are only eligible for access to classified 
information “upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest” to 
authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative 
judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The 
guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human 
behavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, 
considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial 
decision. AG ¶ 2. 
 
Department Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged 
in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting “witnesses and 
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable 
clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
Administrative Judges must remain fair and impartial, and carefully balance the 
needs for the expedient resolution of a case with the demands of due process. Therefore, 
an administrative judge will ensure that an applicant: (a) receives fair notice of the issues, 
(b) has a reasonable opportunity to address those issues, and (c) is not subjected to unfair 
surprise. Directive, ¶ E3.1.10; ISCR Case No. 12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). 
 
In evaluating the evidence, a judge applies a “substantial evidence” standard, 
which is something less than a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, substantial 
evidence is defined as “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.” 
Directive, ¶ E3.1.32.1.8 
 
Any doubt raised by the evidence must be resolved in favor of the national security. 
AG ¶ 2(b). See also Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), ¶ E.4. Additionally, 
                                                          
8 However, a judge’s mere disbelief of an applicant’s testimony, without actual evidence of disqualifying 
conduct or admission by an applicant to the disqualifying conduct, is not enough to sustain an unfavorable 
finding. ISCR Case No. 15-05565 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2017); ISCR Case No. 02-24452 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2004). Furthermore, an unfavorable decision cannot be based on non-alleged conduct. ISCR Case No. 14-
05986 (App. Bd. May 26, 2017). Unless an applicant is provided notice that unalleged conduct raises a 
security concern, it can only be used for specific limited purposes, such as assessing mitigation and 
credibility. ISCR Case No. 16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017). 
 
5 
the Supreme Court has held that responsible officials making “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and 
confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain 
degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of 
compromise of classified information. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant’s failure to file his tax returns and 2009 tax liens, as alleged in the SOR, 
raise the financial considerations security concern, which is set forth at AG ¶ 18:9 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.  
 
The security concern here is not limited to a consideration of whether persons with 
financial issues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in other 
illegality to pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances giving 
rise to delinquent debt cast doubt upon a person’s judgment, self-control, and other 
qualities essential to protecting classified information. See generally ISCR Case No. 11-
05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 In assessing Applicant’s case, I considered the applicable disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, including: 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax 
returns . . . as required; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d):  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(g):  the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
                                                          
9 In light of the evidence, the $475 medical debt allege in SOR 1.b is insignificant from a security risk 
assessment perspective and is decided in Applicant’s favor. 
 
6 
 An applicant who fails to timely file or pay his or her taxes, a basic and fundamental 
financial obligation of all citizens, bears a heavy burden in mitigating the financial 
considerations security concern.10 An administrative judge should closely examine the 
circumstances giving rise to an applicant’s tax-related issues and his or her response to 
it. Furthermore, an applicant’s claim of financial reform must be weighed against the lack 
of judgment and reliability evidenced by the person’s failure to timely file their income tax 
returns or pay their taxes.11  
 
Applicant failed to meet his burden of proof and persuasion. He made a conscious 
decision not to file his tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2015, and only took action 
to resolve the matter after the SOR was issued. Based on the record evidence, I am not 
convinced that Applicant will follow the law in filing and paying his taxes unless the 
Government takes some direct action threatening his personal interests (i.e., IRS files a 
garnishment action or DoD CAF moves to revoke the clearance that he needs to keep his 
six-figure salary job as a federal contractor). Accordingly, I find that the disqualifying 
conditions listed at AG ¶¶ 19(c) and 19(f) apply. None of the mitigating conditions apply. 
The record evidence regarding the manner in which Applicant handles his personal 
financial obligations leaves me with concerns about his ability and willingness to follow 
rules and regulations for the proper handling and safeguarding of classified information. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
 The security clearance process relies on the honesty and candor of all applicants. 
Dishonesty during the security clearance process raises the security concern that is 
explained at AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information.12 
 
 In assessing Applicant’s case, I considered the applicable disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions, including the following: 
 
AG ¶ 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, 
or similar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine national 
security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; 
 
                                                          
10 See generally, ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (Board explained the heightened 
security concerns raised by tax-related financial issues). 
 
11 ISCR Case No. 14-05794 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016); 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016); ISCR Case No. 12-09545 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2015). 
 
12 See also SEAD-4, Appendix A, ¶ 2(i) (“the adjudicative process is predicated upon individuals providing 
relevant information pertaining to their background and character for use in investigating and adjudicating 
their national security eligibility. Any incident of intentional material falsification . . . raises questions about 
an individual's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.”)  
 
7 
AG ¶ 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the  
. . . falsification before being confronted with the facts; and 
 
AG ¶ 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the 
behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances 
that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
 Applicant deliberately failed to report on the SCA his failure to file his 2012 and 
2013 federal income tax returns.13 He attempted to hide his ongoing tax problems by 
claiming that they were “completely resolved.”14 (Exhibit 1 at 33) At the time, Applicant’s 
federal tax case was ongoing and he was not filing his income tax returns when they were 
due. He continued not to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes after submitting the 
SCA. At hearing, Applicant admitted that he deliberately falsified his SCA, but this belated 
action is insufficient to mitigate the serious security concerns raised by his dishonesty. In 
short, through his words and his actions, Applicant showed that he is untrustworthy and 
not a suitable candidate for a security clearance. AG ¶ 16(a) applies. None of the 
mitigating conditions apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 In addition to the specific adjudicative guidelines at issue, a judge must also take 
into account factors that are applicable to all cases. These factors are grouped together 
under the all-encompassing umbrella of the whole-person concept.15 I hereby incorporate 
my above analysis and highlight some additional whole-person matters.  
 
 Applicant is a dedicated father, who voluntarily spent a substantial amount of his 
personal financial fortune and time in helping his daughter overcome her drug addiction. 
He is a U.S. military veteran and has worked as a cleared federal contractor for many 
years. However, this and the other favorable record evidence are insufficient to mitigate 
the heightened security concerns raised by Applicant’s history of tax-related issues and 
dishonesty during the security clearance process. Overall, the record evidence leaves me 
with serious doubts about Applicant’s eligibility for continued access to classified 
information.16 
 
  
                                                          
13 The SOR alleges in 2.a that Applicant failed to report his failure to file his 2012 – 2015 tax returns. 
Although Applicant’s 2014 and 2015 returns would not have been due at the time Applicant submitted his 
SCA on April 8, 2015, I find that he was on sufficient notice that his failure to file his 2012 and 2013 tax 
returns raised a security concern under Guideline E.  
 
14 The SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to disclose the 2009 tax liens. Although Applicant’s disclosure 
of his past tax problems was far from complete, he did put the Government on notice that he had tax issues 
between 1994 and 2010. (Exhibit 1 at 34) Accordingly, SOR 2.b is decided in his favor.  
 
15 See AG ¶ 2. See also SEAD-4, ¶ E.4; Directive, ¶ 6.3. 
 
16 I also considered the exceptions listed in SEAD 4, Appendix C, but none are warranted in this case. 
 
8 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d:        Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.c:          For Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):       AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a:          Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 2.b:          For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant Applicant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.
