HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided insufficient evidence of resolution of his financial issues. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.      
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On February 9, 2016, Applicant signed his Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Item 2. On June 29, 2017, the 
Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A 
the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs). The SOR set forth 
security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. Item 1. 
 
On July 17, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he did not 
request a hearing. Item 2. On August 17, 2017, Department Counsel completed the File 
of Relevant Material (FORM). On August 22, 2017, Applicant received the FORM, and 
he did not respond to the FORM. On December 18, 2017, the case was assigned to me. 
 
2 
                                         
 
The case file consists of five exhibits. Items 1-5. Applicant did not object to any of the 
Government exhibits, and they are admitted into evidence. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.z. Item 1. His SOR response did not provide extenuating and mitigating 
information.   
 
Applicant is a 62-year-old senior engineer, and the same employer has employed 
him since 1980.2 In 1977, he received a bachelor’s degree, and in 1980, he received a 
master’s degree. He has not served in the U.S. armed forces. He has never married and 
has no children. There is no evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of 
illegal drugs. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts totaling $ 537,477 as follows: ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.b, and 1.t are accounts relating to a mortgage in foreclosure for $185,772, a home-
equity line of credit for $24,999, and a home-equity line of credit for $119,653; ¶¶ 1.c 
through 1.k are nine charged-off debts owed to banks for $23,149, $22,747, $21,478, 
$18,578, $11,131, $10,563, $8,956, $5,509, and $2,570; ¶¶ 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.u, and 
1.w are six charged-off debts or debts placed for collection for $495, $240, $116, $70, 
$146, and $1,061; and ¶¶ 1.p, 1.q, and 1.r are three judgments for $1,282, $5,864, and 
$6,280. SOR ¶ 1.s alleges that in July 2016, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 
13 of the Bankruptcy Code, and in August 2016, the bankruptcy was dismissed. SOR ¶ 
1.v alleges a credit card account is 90 days past due in the amount of $833 with a balance 
of $10,818. SOR ¶¶ 1.x and 1.y allege he failed to file as required his federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2015. SOR ¶ 1.z alleges a delinquent 
federal income tax debt for $56,000 for tax year 2008.  
 
Applicant was generous with family and friends.3 He provided financial assistance 
to his disabled sister, to his mother before she passed away, and to a friend. He provides 
the friend $1,000 per month. Applicant stopped paying his mortgage in 2011, and his 
home was in foreclosure. He has not paid the real estate taxes for at least one year on 
his residence because his residence is in foreclosure. Applicant filed for bankruptcy to 
stop the foreclosure, and then he decided to stop the bankruptcy because he believed he 
could pay his debts. In July 2016, he received financial counseling as part of the 
                                            
1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
2 The source of the information in this paragraph is Applicant’s February 9, 2016 Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Item 2. 
  
 
3 The source of the information in this paragraph is his August 22, 2016 Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI). Item 3.

bankruptcy process. His annual gross income is about $145,000. As of August 22, 2016, 
Applicant had not filed his federal and state income tax returns for 2008 through 2015. 
His $56,000 federal income tax debt for tax year 2008 resulted from an early withdrawal 
from his 401(k) account.  
 
 In the FORM, Department Counsel noted the absence of corroborating or 
supporting documentation of resolution of the SOR debts. FORM at 2-3. Aside from 
Applicant’s uncorroborated statements, there is no documentary evidence that Applicant 
paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. 
The record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed 
explanations of the causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information. 
The FORM informed Applicant that he had 30 days from the receipt of the FORM “in 
which to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, 
mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate. If you do not file any objections or submit any 
additional information . . . your case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for a 
determination based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM. FORM at 3. He did 
not respond to the FORM. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
4 
                                         
 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
 
5 
                                         
 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” 
In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability 
of mitigating conditions. 
 
 Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
6 
                                         
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;5   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
Applicant’s financial support for family and friends were partially or fully outside his 
control and adversely affected his finances. He received financial counseling. However, 
without more specific information, he did not establish that he acted prudently, and how 
circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances. Applicant did not prove 
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition]. 
 
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
he acted responsibly under the circumstances because he did not show the changes in 
his income or the specific needs of family and friends over the last five years, and he did 
not establish he was unable to make any payments to address any of the SOR debts. 
 
Applicant did not provide documentation relating to his SOR debts such as: (1) 
proof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or 
a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) 
correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact;6 (3) copies 
of credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating 
he did not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) 
evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or 
agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve this debt; or (5) other evidence of 
progress or resolution.  
 
Applicant failed to prove that he filed his federal and state income tax returns for 
tax years 2008 to 2015. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the 
IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.7 For 
purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal 
income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure to timely file 
federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
                                            
6 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.  
 
7 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor without 
regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 
479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. United 
States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated 
to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of 
[a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed, the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  
 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress sooner resolving his tax issues and other delinquent debts. There is insufficient 
assurance his financial problems are resolved, under control, and will not recur in the 
future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial 
considerations security concerns.

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 62-year-old senior engineer, and the same employer has employed 
him since 1980. In 1977, he received a bachelor’s degree, and in 1980, he received a 
master’s degree. There is no evidence of security violations, abuse of alcohol, or use of 
illegal drugs. 
 
I have credited Applicant with mitigation of the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.s that he filed 
for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the court dismissed his 
bankruptcy the next month. He decided that bankruptcy was not prudent because he had 
sufficient income to pay his debts. His bankruptcy filing and its dismissal do not 
necessarily show financial irresponsibility.  
 
The evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial. Applicant’s 
SOR alleges 23 delinquent debts totaling $537,477. He failed to prove he filed his state 
and federal income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2015. He did not provide 
sufficient evidence of changes in his financial circumstances to show he was unable to 
make any payments to any of his SOR creditors. He provided insufficient corroborating 
or substantiating documentary evidence of payments and an established payment plan 
or other mitigating information relating to his SOR debts. His actions show lack of financial 
responsibility and judgment and raise unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More 
documented information about inability to pay debts, financial history, or financial 
progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security

clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 
10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the 
whole person. Financial consideration security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance 
eligibility at this time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.r:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.s:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.t through 1.z:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance.
