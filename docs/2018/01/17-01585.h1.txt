HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided insufficient evidence that he was unable to make greater 
progress resolving the delinquent debts and filing overdue tax returns on the statement 
of reasons (SOR). He had four arrests for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) 
from 2006 to 2015. Security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations), G 
(alcohol consumption), and J (criminal conduct) are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.            
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On June 28, 2016, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). Government Exhibit (GE) 1. On May 30, 
2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 
2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006. Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2. The SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F, G, and J. HE 2. 
 
On June 20, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested 
a hearing. HE 3. On August 23, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On

August 28, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On November 8, 2017, the Defense Office 
of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for 
December 1, 2017. HE 1.1 Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits; Applicant did not 
offer any exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. Transcript (Tr.) 14, 18-20; GE 1-7. On December 20, 2017, DOHA received a 
copy of the hearing transcript.  
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive 
Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who require eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position on or after June 
8, 2017. The new AGs supersede the previous AGs, and I have evaluated Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.2

1 Applicant was unable to attend the first scheduled hearing on October 31, 2017, because the 
video teleconference room at his location was unavailable to him. Applicant was not responsible for not 
attending the first hearing.  
 
2 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/SEAD4 20170608.pdf.

not pay child support for her. Tr. 22. Applicant’s child support situation is unclear because 
two different states are handling child support and their records show inconsistencies 
between the amount of support required from the two states. Tr. 10, 23-25.  
 
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $11,125, and the record establishes 
the status of Applicant’s accounts as follows:

Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct 
 
In 2006, Applicant was arrested for DUI. Tr. 36. His blood-alcohol content (BAC) 
was .126. Tr. 37. He received a letter of reprimand from his commanding officer. Tr. 36. 
He was convicted of DUI in a state court and sentenced to pay a $1,500 fine. GE 4 at 2. 
 
In 2012, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He received nonjudicial punishment (NJP) 
for the DUI. His BAC was about .06, which was sufficient in the overseas location where 
the offense occurred to constitute DUI. Tr. 37-39. As a result of the NJP process, he 
received forfeiture of $700 pay per month for two months, restriction, extra duty, and a 
reprimand. GE 6 at 11. He attended alcohol counseling after the 2012 DUI. Tr. 36, 39. He 
was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Tr. 40.  
 
In 2013, Applicant was arrested for DUI. Tr. 40. He did not remember his BAC. Tr. 
41. He was briefly jailed after the DUI. Tr. 41. He pleaded nolo contendere to DUI. SOR 
response. After the 2013 DUI, he stopped drinking alcohol for six or seven months, and 
then he resumed his alcohol consumption. Tr. 44. After he was found guilty, Applicant 
was working on his vehicle, and he was accused of tampering with the interlock device, 
or ignition lock for detection of alcohol consumption on his vehicle. Tr. 41. He was jailed 
for about six months. Tr. 42. He did not indicate whether or not he was convicted of 
tampering with an interlock device. The SOR does not allege he violated a condition of 
probation. 
 
In January 2015, Applicant was arrested for DUI. Tr. He did not remember his BAC. 
Tr. 46. He was found guilty of DUI. SOR response. Applicant completed a defensive 
driving course, and in 2015, he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse at the VA. Tr. 44. He 
did not attend any Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings after the 2015 DUI. Tr. 48. 
 
Applicant most recently consumed alcohol the weekend before his hearing. Tr. 48. 
He consumed a “couple beers and a few shots.” Tr. 48. He did not drive after consuming 
alcohol on that occasion. Tr. 48. He most recently drank sufficient alcohol to feel 
intoxicated a “month or so” before his hearing. Tr. 48. He consumed beer, and then he 
drove a “couple of weeks” before his hearing. Tr. 49. Although he consumes more alcohol 
than he believes he should, he did not concede that he is an “alcoholic or a problematic 
drinker.” Tr. 49. In the future, he intends to drink alcohol responsibly because an additional 
DUI would be a felony. Tr. 49.     
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
 
5 
                                         
 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
applicant’s personal or professional history that may disqualify the applicant for eligibility 
for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial evidence” 
is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington Metro. Area 
Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 
1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”; “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” 
In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability 
of mitigating conditions. 
 
 Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. February 16, 
2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)).

victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;5   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
                                            
5 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
Applicant’s unemployment from May 2013 to July 2014 was partially or fully outside 
his control and adversely affected his finances. He did not receive financial counseling. 
However, without more information, he did not establish that he acted prudently, and how 
circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances. Applicant did not prove 
he acted responsibly under the circumstances because he did not show the changes in 
his income or the specific needs of family and friends over the last five years, and he did 
not establish he was unable to make any payments to address any of the SOR debts. 
 
Applicant did not provide documentation relating to his SOR debts such as: (1) 
proof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or 
a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) 
correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact;6 (3) copies 
of credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating 
he did not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) 
evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or 
agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve this debt; or (5) other evidence of 
progress or resolution.  
 
Applicant failed to prove that he filed his state income tax returns for tax years 
2013 and 2015 and his federal income tax returns for tax year 2015. A willful failure to 
timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a 
misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.7 For purposes of this decision, I am not 
weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns against him as a 
federal crime. In regard to the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, 
the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
                                            
6 “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current.  
 
7 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . .  
 
A willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor without 
regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 
479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. United 
States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931).

Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated 
to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of 
[a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed, the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: 
 
Failure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an 
applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules 
and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is 
essential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, 
Applicant did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and 
reliability required of persons granted access to classified information.

ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted).  
 
There is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater 
progress sooner resolving his tax issues and other delinquent debts. There is insufficient 
assurance his financial problems are resolved, under control, and will not recur in the 
future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial 
considerations security concerns. 
 
Alcohol Consumption 
 
 AG ¶ 21 articulates the Government’s concern about alcohol consumption, 
“Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or 
the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and 
trustworthiness.” 
   
  AG ¶ 22 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case including: 
 
(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under 
the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other 
incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual’s alcohol 
use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; 
and 
 
(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol8 to the point of impaired 
judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol 
use disorder. 
 
  AG ¶¶ 22(a) and 22(c) apply. Applicant’s four alcohol-related incidents involving 
the police, courts, or his command occurred from 2006 to 2015. His BAC for the 2006 
DUI was .126. He could not remember his BAC for the two most recent DUIs. His BAC 
level of .126 establishes that he engaged in binge alcohol consumption to the extent of 
impaired judgment.9    
   
  
                                            
8Although the term “binge” drinking is not defined in the Adjudicative Guidelines, the generally 
accepted definition of binge drinking for males is the consumption of five or more drinks in about two hours.
 
The definition of binge drinking was approved by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
(NIAAA) National Advisory Council in February 2004. See U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, NIAAA 
Newsletter 3 (Winter 2004 No. 3), http://www.pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/Newsletter/winter2004/ 
NewsletterNumber3.pdf.  
 
9 “Binge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States.” See 
the Center for Disease Control website, (stating “The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 
0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when 
women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.”), https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-
drinking.htm.  
 
11 
                                         
 
  AG ¶ 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: 
 
(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or 
does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or 
judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol 
use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has 
demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or 
abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; 
 
(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has 
no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory 
progress in a treatment program; and 
 
(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along 
with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established 
pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment 
recommendations. 
   
None of the mitigating conditions are fully established. Security clearance cases 
are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, because the facts, degree, and 
timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many different permutations. The 
DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial alcohol abuse that AG ¶ 
23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly lengthy period of 
abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 
14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-
10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).     
 
I have carefully considered the Appeal Board’s jurisprudence on alcohol 
consumption and Applicant’s history of alcohol consumption. He has a sustained period 
of mostly responsible alcohol consumption or abstinence.  
 
Several factors weigh against mitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns: 
Applicant’s four DUIs; his reluctance to forswear his alcohol consumption; his binge 
alcohol consumption to the extent of a .126 BAC in 2006; his inability to remember the 
BACs on his two most recent DUIs; he recently drove after drinking beer; he recently 
drank to intoxication; and his alleged tampering with an interlock device after his 2013 
DUI. More time without an alcohol-related incident and binge-alcohol consumption is 
necessary to resolve my lingering doubts about Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment. Alcohol consumption security concerns are not 
mitigated.   
 
  
 
12 
                                         
 
Criminal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, “Criminal 
activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its 
very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, 
rules, and regulations.” 
 
AG ¶ 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case including: 
 
(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be 
unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in 
combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or 
trustworthiness; and 
 
(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. 
 
AG ¶¶ 31(a) and 31(b) apply. The SOR alleges and the record establishes 
Applicant committed four misdemeanor-level DUI criminal offenses involving alcohol. He 
had three misdemeanor-level DUI convictions and one finding that he committed a DUI 
as part of an NJP. Applicant admitted the four incidents of criminal conduct. 
 
AG ¶ 32 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: 
 
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and 
does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and 
those pressures are no longer present in the person's life; 
 
(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; 
and 
 
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited 
to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, 
compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher 
education, good employment record, or constructive community 
involvement. 
 
For the reasons indicated in the previous section, none of the mitigating conditions 
fully apply. His crimes create doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, 
and raise questions about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and 
regulations. More time must elapse without violations of criminal laws before there is 
 
13 
                                         
 
enough assurance that criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. Applicant is not ready to be 
entrusted with access to classified information.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F, G, and 
J are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a government contractor who has worked 
as an aerospace avionics and electrical technician since July 2014. He served on active 
duty in the Air Force from March 2004 to May 2013, and his specialty was avionics. When 
he left the Air Force, he was a staff sergeant. He is receiving 20 percent disability from 
the VA. In 2009, he received an associate’s degree in avionic systems and technology. 
He held a security clearance for nine years while serving in the Air Force, and there is no 
evidence of security violations.  
 
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $11,125. The medical debts for $11 
and $15 in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f are mitigated because they are too minor to raise a security 
concern. I accept Applicant’s statement that he returned the creditor’s cable equipment, 
and he does not owe the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b for $795. His finances were adversely affected 
by circumstances partially or fully beyond his control including his unemployment after 
leaving the Air Force. 
 
Applicant provided insufficient corroborating or substantiating documentary 
evidence of payments and established payment plans for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 
and 1.d. He did not establish he had insufficient income to make more progress sooner 
on more of his SOR debts. He has not filed his federal income tax return for tax year 
2015, and his state tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015. His actions show lack of 
financial responsibility and judgment and raise unmitigated questions about Applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More 
 
14 
                                         
 
information about inability to pay debts, financial history, or documented financial 
progress is necessary to mitigate security concerns.  
 
Applicant had four DUI arrests from 2006 to 2015, resulting in NJP and three DUI 
convictions. He continues to drive after drinking alcohol, and he drinks alcohol to 
intoxication. It is difficult to rule out alcohol-related judgment errors in the future. 
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated Guideline F, J, and G 
security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is 
not warranted at this time.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that Guidelines F, J, and G security concerns are not mitigated, and it is not clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this 
time.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.b:    For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:  Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h:  Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline J:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 3, Guideline G:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 3.a:    Against Applicant    
  
 
15 
                                         
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
