Decision 
______________ 
 
 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his 
use of marijuana.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on December 7, 2015. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On May 30, 2017, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudication Guidelines (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016). In this case, the SOR was issued under 
2 
 
the action under the security guideline known as Guideline H for drug involvement and 
substance misuse. Applicant answered the SOR on June 21, 2017, and requested a 
decision based on the written record without a hearing.   
 
On August 1, 2017, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on August 3, 2017. He was given an 
opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on August 10, 2017. Applicant did 
not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 7, 2017.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were six items of evidence, which are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6. These exhibits 
 are admitted into evidence without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 61 years old, a high school graduate, married, and has two adult 
daughters. Since September 1984, he has worked for a defense contractor.3 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant (1) used marijuana weekly from about June 2013 
to October 2015; (2) purchased marijuana with varying frequency from about June 2013 
to October 2015; (3) used marijuana after being granted a clearance in February 1985; 
(4) tested positive for marijuana in October 2015; and (5) was diagnosed with cannabis 
use disorder and alcohol use disorder in October 2015.4 Applicant admits those 
allegations.5  
 
Applicant used marijuana three to six times a week, between about June 2013 and 
October 2015. On October 21, 2015, he was involved in an accident while driving a 
company vehicle. As a result, he was given a drug/alcohol test, which tested positive for 
marijuana.6 In about June 2013, Applicant began using marijuana on weekends with 
friends and family members at social gatherings. He claims he used marijuana as a 
substitute for alcohol, after he stopped drinking following a 2007 driving under the 
                                                          
Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006. My decision and 
formal findings under the revised Guideline H would not be different under the 2006 Guidelines.

which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.

influence arrest.7 After his positive urinalysis, Applicant’s employer required that he 
complete an employee assistance program and submit to mandatory testing for a year. 
During his treatment, he was diagnosed with cannabis use disorder and alcohol use 
disorder, and he was successfully discharged in December 2015. Despite claims that he 
has no future intent to use marijuana, he continues to associate with friends and family 
who use marijuana, because he does not want to isolate himself from family and friends.8 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.9 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”10 Under Egan, E.O. 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether an 
applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of 
protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.11 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.12 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.13 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.14 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.15 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.16

 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.18 
 
      Discussion 
 
Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse 
 
 Under AG H for drug use,19 suitability of an applicant may be questioned or put 
into doubt because drug use can both impair judgment and raise questions about a 
person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations: 
 
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription 
and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause 
physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their 
intended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and 
trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or 
psychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's 
ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled 
substance means any "controlled substance" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. 
Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any 
of the behaviors listed above. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  
 
 AG ¶ 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; 
 
AG ¶ 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, 
processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug  
paraphernalia; 
 
AG ¶ 25(d)  diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional 
(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social 
worker) of substance use disorder;

19 AG ¶¶ 24, 25 and 26 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). 
 
 
5 
 
 
AG ¶ 25(f)  any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or 
holding a sensitive position;  
 
AG ¶ 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; and,  
 
AG ¶ 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and 
substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this 
problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not 
limited to: 
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and,   
 
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug 
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future 
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security 
eligibility.  
 
Applicant admitted using marijuana three to six times a week between about June 
2013 and October 2015 while holding a security clearance. Facts admitted by an applicant 
in an answer to a SOR or in an interview require no further proof.20 Marijuana is a 
Schedule I controlled substance, and its possession is regulated by the federal 
government under the Controlled Substances Act.21 The knowing or intentional 
possession and use of any controlled substance is unlawful and punishable by 
imprisonment and or a fine.22 In an October 25, 2014 memorandum, the Director of 
National Intelligence reaffirmed that the use of marijuana is relevant to national security 
determinations, regardless of changes to state laws concerning marijuana use.23 AG ¶¶ 
25(a) through (d), and (f) apply. The next inquiry is whether any mitigating factors apply. 
 
I have considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(a). Applicant used marijuana between 
three to six times per week from June 2013 to October 2015. His behavior was neither 
                                                          
20 ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made to the SOR 
allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 
(App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n applicant’s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal 
basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).

infrequent, nor did it occur long ago, with his last use being in October 2015, just over two 
years ago. AG ¶ 26(a) does not apply. 
 
 I also considered mitigating factor AG ¶ 26(b). Applicant has acknowledged his 
drug involvement and successfully completed a treatment program.24 He has also 
expressed his intent not to use drugs in the future. The troubling aspects of this case are 
two-fold. First, it appears that Applicant is reluctant to disassociate himself from drug-
using friends and family members and to avoid the environment where drugs are used. 
His explanation is reasonable – he does not wish to isolate himself from friends and 
family, some of whom openly use marijuana. Nevertheless, Applicant needs to develop a 
strategy for dealing with those gatherings where marijuana might be used. Second, he 
needs to show an “established pattern of abstinence.” Applicant used marijuana 
frequently from June 2013 to October 2015, almost two and one-half years. It seems 
prudent that Applicant be required to show an established period of abstinence that at 
minimum exceeds his two years and one-half years of drug usage.  AG ¶ 26(b) does not 
apply.     ` 
 
         The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, 
and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the 
evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.25 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline H:     Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:                   Against Applicant 
    
 
 
 
 
 
                                                          
24 This acknowledgement was unavoidable, since Applicant was involved in an accident with a company 
car, which resulted in a mandated urinalysis that came back positive. Nonetheless, he successfully 
completed his course of treatment, and we have no reason to doubt that he has remained drug-free since 
October 2015. For this he is to be given credit.  
 
25 AG ¶¶ 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). I took into positive account the complimentary character reference letter 
submitted by Applicant’s manager.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
