LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for 
access to classified information. He has a long-standing history of noncompliance with 
his tax obligations. He failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2004 
through 2014, and he owes more than $23,000 to the IRS. He also owes at least $6,408 
to the state tax authority based on a state tax lien filed in May 2016. His tax problems 
went on far too long, are too much, and are too recent to justify a favorable clearance 
decision. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on February 3, 2015.1 This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. Thereafter, on October 14, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
                                                          
1 Exhibit 1.  
 
 
2 
 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations 
based on a history of financial problems.   
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 17, 2016. He admitted all the factual 
allegations made in SOR. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on February 7, 2017. The hearing took place as 
scheduled on April 26, 2017. Applicant appeared without counsel. Both Department 
Counsel and Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 
1-6 and A-G, respectively. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on May 4, 2017. 
The record was kept open until May 10, 2017, to allow Applicant an opportunity to 
submit additional documentary matters, but no such matters were received.2 
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security 
clearance for the first time. His educational background includes a high school diploma 
and some college. He is employed by a logistics company as a material expediter on a 
U.S. military installation. He has never married and has no children. His employment 
history does not include military service. He has a good employment record and is 
considered a trustworthy employee according to six letters of recommendation 
submitted by co-workers and supervisors.3 
 
In his February 2015 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed a wage 
garnishment or attachment for about $1,300 owed to a state tax authority. Otherwise, he 
did not disclose any problems with his financial record. As alleged in the SOR and 
admitted by Applicant, he has a long-standing history of financial problems consisting of 
the following matters: (1) failure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 
2004 through 2014; (2) a federal tax delinquency of $30,094 based upon a tax lien 
entered against him in 2012; (3) a federal tax delinquency of $12,691 for tax years 2008 
through 2015; (4) failure to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2006 and 
2007; (5) a state tax delinquency of $6,408 based upon a tax lien entered against him in 
2016; and (6) four collection accounts for a total of $2,549.4 In addition to his 
admissions to the SOR allegations, the above matters are established by his responses 
to interrogatories and credit reports from 2015 and 2016.5

3 Exhibits B-G.  
 
4 Tr. 35.  
 
5 Exhibits 2-6.

At the hearing, Applicant did not present documentation showing that any of the 
four collection accounts were paid, in a payment arrangement, in dispute, settled or 
compromised, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. He acknowledged that the 
collection accounts were unpaid as far as he knew.6  
 
Applicant failed to meet his tax obligations due to a serious misunderstanding. 
He understood that if you do not file a tax return, then you are not required to file a tax 
return, but if you file a return once, then you are required to file forever.7 He further 
explained that he believed he was not responsible for filing returns and paying taxes 
because he did not own a business or corporation.8 He claimed that he did not realize 
that the state tax authority and IRS were separate entities.9 He denied that he was a tax 
protester or was otherwise engaged in tax evasion.10  
 
Applicant’s understanding of his tax obligations changed in March 2012, when 
the IRS filed a $30,904 federal tax lien and explained and clarified his obligations.11 As 
of June 2016, per his IRS account transcripts, Applicant owed approximately $23,196 in 
back taxes, penalties, and interest for tax years 2004 through 2015.12 That sum 
excludes tax years 2010 and 2011 for which there are no account transcripts.  
 
In 2012, Applicant hired a tax preparer to help him prepare and file the past-due 
returns.13 The IRS prepared substitute tax returns for Applicant for tax years 2004 
through 2007; he filed tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2012 in June 2013; and he 
filed tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2015 in May and June 2016.14 To repay the 
tax delinquency, he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in June 2013, 
but the agreement was no longer in effect by September 2014, which suggests he 
defaulted.15 Applicant believed he was in an installment agreement with the IRS as of

11 Tr. 38, 61.  
 
12 Exhibit 2.  
 
13 Tr. 38-39, 44.  
 
14 Exhibit 2. As I understand IRS practice and procedure, for a taxpayer who has not filed a return in 
many years, the IRS requires a taxpayer to go back and file returns for the last six years and then make 
arrangements to pay what is owed in order to be in compliance. The six-year-period for past-due returns 
is found in IRS Policy Statement 5-133 and Internal Revenue Manual 1.2.14.1.18.

2016, and was paying his tax preparer $200 monthly for that purpose.16 In a June 9, 
2016 letter, his tax preparer stated that Applicant was paying $200 monthly per an 
installment agreement.17 Applicant did not present a copy of his installment agreement, 
nor did he present a copy of any annual statements the IRS issues to a taxpayer for an 
installment agreement. Applicant stopped using the services of his initial tax preparer in 
mid-2016 and hired another tax preparer to assist him.18 
 
Concerning the state tax matters, the state tax authority filed a $6,408 tax lien 
against Applicant in May 2016.19 Other than the wage garnishment or attachment he 
disclosed in his security clearance application, he has not made any payments to the 
state tax authority for his back taxes.20 Applicant believed that his initial tax preparer 
filed the state income tax returns, but he expressed some uncertainty about the matter, 
and he did not present copies of the state returns or other documentary proof of filing.21 
 
Applicant’s plan to resolve his back taxes and collection accounts is to seek relief 
in bankruptcy court. To that end, he retained the services of an attorney in November 
2016, but a bankruptcy petition has not yet been filed.22 Since the general rule is that 
most tax debts cannot be discharged (wiped out) in bankruptcy, Applicant understands 
his attorney has advised him that a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case with a payment plan is 
the best course of action.23

Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security

It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.25 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”26 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.27 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.28 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.29 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.30 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.31 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.32 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.33 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.34 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is:

‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no 
right to a security clearance).

Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . .35 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive 
information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:  
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income 
tax as required;   
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.   
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. His history of financial 
problems goes back many years when he began his practice of not filing federal or state 
income tax returns and continued until 2012, when he began the process of resolving 
his failure to timely file returns and failure to pay tax when due. His federal returns have 
now been filed through tax year 2015, but I an unable to determine if he has filed his 
state returns. He owes the IRS more than $23,000 in back taxes, penalties, and interest 
(and probably more) based on a review of the available IRS account transcripts. He 
owes the state tax authority $6,408 (and probably more) based on a 2016 state tax lien. 
He does not have a payment plan in place with the IRS or state tax authority. He 
intends to seek relief via bankruptcy court, although a bankruptcy case has yet to be 
filed on his behalf.  
 
                                                          
35 AG ¶ 18.

 Applicant’s tax problems are unresolved and ongoing. The failure to timely file tax 
returns and pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious 
concern to the federal government.36 Both the failure to file and pay tax when due 
suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established 
governmental rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems 
is essential for protecting classified or sensitive information. An applicant who has a 
history of not fulfilling their tax obligations, which is the case here, may be said not to 
have demonstrated the high degree of judgment and reliability required for access to 
classified or sensitive information.  
 
 Accepting his statements and explanations at face value, Applicant had a gross 
misunderstanding of his tax obligations. He saw the light in 2012, when the IRS took 
enforcement action against him. He has since been working to come into compliance 
with the IRS and state tax authority. His actions in that regard amount to taking the 
initial steps in the right direction. His efforts, while commendable, are insufficient to 
overcome the serious concern raised by his failure to meet his tax obligations over a 
period of many years. It is my view that his tax problems went on far too long, are too 
much, and are too recent to justify a favorable clearance decision. 
 
  Applicant’s long-standing history of noncompliance with his tax obligations 
creates serious doubt about his reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to 
protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a 
whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or 
vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he 
did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with 
the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.i:   Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.
