LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny him eligibility for 
access to classified information. He has an extensive history of illegal use of controlled 
substances (cocaine and marijuana) as well as the misuse of prescription and non-
prescription drugs. He recently misused Xanax in November 2016. He did not present 
sufficient evidence to show that his drug involvement and substance misuse are safely 
in the past. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on January 13, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. Thereafter, on December 7, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline H for drug involvement and 
substance misuse.     
 
Applicant answered the SOR on January 11, 2017; he admitted the factual 
allegations in the SOR except for the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f; and he 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on 
February 16, 2017. The hearing took place as scheduled on April 26, 2017. Department 
Counsel called no witnesses and offered Exhibits 1 and 2. Applicant testified and 
offered Exhibit A. All exhibits were admitted. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received 
on May 4, 2017.  
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 26-year-old technical support engineer for a federal contractor. He 
has worked for his current employer since November 2015. He earns an annual salary 
of about $54,000. He has never married and has no children. His educational 
background includes an associate’s degree in business awarded in 2013 and a 
bachelor’s degree in marketing awarded in 2015. This is his first job working in the 
defense industry, and it is his initial application for a security clearance. He has a 
favorable letter of recommendation from a former employer.2  
 
Applicant has admitted a history of illegal use of controlled substances as well as 
misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs as follows: (1) he used and 
purchased cocaine with varying frequency during 2011-2015; (2) he used and 
purchased marijuana with varying frequency during 2009-2014; (3) he used 
hallucinogens about three times during 2012-2014, and he purchased hallucinogens 
once in September 2014; (4) he used Ecstasy twice during 2012-2014; (5) he misused 
Oxycodone, which was not prescribed to him, by using it for recreational purposes 
during 2012-2015; (6) he misused Xanax, which was prescribed to him, by using it for 
recreational purposes during 2011-2015; and (7) he sold the medication Adderall during 
2013-2015.3 In addition, during the hearing he admitted misusing Xanax, which was 
prescribed to him, on several occasions in about November 2016. His latest misuse 
occurred several months after he submitted the security clearance application.4 He 
attributed the misuse to a “weak moment.”5 He also stated that he passed a pre-
employment drug test for his current job.6

Applicant has not undergone any type of drug-treatment or substance-abuse 
program. He is under the care of a psychiatrist for minor depression, anxiety, and 
attention deficit disorder (ADD).7 He explained he has not sought out drug treatment or 
counseling because he is a very private person and he does not want anyone else to 
know about his substance-abuse issues.8 Going forward, his intention is not to use 
illegal drugs or misuse legal drugs, but he conceded it is more difficult than just saying 
so.9 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.10 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.11 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”12 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.13 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.14 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.15 The Government has the burden of presenting

evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.16 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.17 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.18 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.19 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, 
and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern is 
that: 
 
[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of 
prescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances 
that cause physical or mental impairment or are use in a manner 
inconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an 
individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior 
may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises 
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, 
and regulations.21 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 25(a) any substance abuse; 
 
AG ¶ 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including 
cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or 
possession of drug paraphernalia; 
 
AG ¶ 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; and

17 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.

21 AG ¶ 24.

AG ¶ 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and 
substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this 
problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not 
limited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) 
changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) 
providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement 
and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or 
misuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. 
  
 I have considered the totality of Applicant’s drug abuse and misuse during 2009-
2016 as reflected in the record evidence. Overall, his behavior is relatively recent with 
the latest misuse of Xanax occurring in November 2016. His illegal drug use and misuse 
of prescription drugs was not infrequent as it happened multiple times over a period of 
years.22 And it did not occur under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. His use of 
cocaine is quite serious and it was not limited to a brief period (2011-2015).23 Although 
the majority of his drug abuse and misuse occurred during his years as a student, I am 
not persuaded that his misbehavior is safely in the past and will not recur. The best 
evidence on that point is twofold: (1) his misuse of Xanax in November 2016, which was 
several months after he submitted his security clearance application; and (2) his 
reluctance to undergo drug treatment or counseling.  
 
 Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I have doubts or concerns 
about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence 
as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable 
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I 
conclude that he did not meet ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information.

Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national
