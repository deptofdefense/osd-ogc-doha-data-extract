GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by his failure to timely file 
his federal income tax returns and his delinquent federal and state taxes. Clearance is 
denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 6, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial 
considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on September 1, 2006.1 
 
                                                          
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

Applicant responded to the SOR on February 21, 2017, and elected to have his 
case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government’s written case 
was submitted on March 27, 2017. A complete copy of the file of relevant material 
(FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections 
and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant 
received the FORM on April 11, 2017. He did not respond to the Government’s FORM. 
The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2017. The Government’s documents 
identified as Items 1 through 11 are admitted in evidence without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a. As he did not specifically admit or 
deny the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, I have construed his lack of a specific 
response as denials.2  
 
 Applicant is 68 years old. He obtained his high-school diploma at a date not in 
the record. He attended community college from 1968 to 1971 but did not earn a 
degree. He worked for the federal government from March 1971 until he retired in 
August 2004. He has been employed by a defense contractor since August 2004, 
during which time he rotated every six months until July 2007 between an overseas 
deployment and working in-country. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 
1971.3 
 
 Applicant married in 1972, divorced in 1981, and married again in 1984. He has 
four adult children.4     
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns 
for tax years 2009 through 2014. It also alleges that he owed $4,994 in delinquent state 
taxes and $3,092 in delinquent federal taxes. Applicant listed and discussed his failure 
to file and pay his 2008 and 2009 state and federal taxes on his March 2014 security 
clearance application and in his June 2014 interview. He also listed his failure to timely 
file his federal income tax returns from 2009 through 2014, and his delinquent state and 
federal taxes, in his September 2016 response to interrogatories.5  
 
 Applicant attributed the untimely filing of his federal tax returns and his delinquent 
taxes to his belief that his wife took care of their finances and tax obligations. He stated 
that he first became aware that she had not done so when he received a garnishment 
notice for unpaid state taxes at a date not in the record. He also indicated that during 
most of the years in which he failed to timely file his federal tax returns, he and his wife 
paid his one child’s college tuition and student loan expenses, and had to financially

assist another child who was only able to obtain part-time employment. He also cited to 
tax reform and their inability to continue to claim their children as dependents on their 
taxes as contributing factors.6  
 
 In his security clearance application and during his interview, Applicant indicated 
that he owed $35,000 in federal taxes for tax period 2008, and paid the majority of it at 
the time he filed his 2008 taxes by borrowing $30,000 from his 401k. He then paid the 
remaining $12,440 in 2012, after a tax lien was entered against him. He indicated that 
he still owed and was working to resolve the interest that accrued for both his state and 
federal taxes, which he believed was between $600 and $800. He expected to pay the 
outstanding interest by the end of 2014.7  
 
 In his response to interrogatories, Applicant indicated that he filed his 2009 and 
2011 tax returns in December 2013, his 2014 tax returns in April 2015, and his 2013 tax 
returns in April 2016. He provided “no info” for tax period 2010, and he indicated a 
“notice of intent to levy 5/2014” for tax period 2012. He did not specify whether this 
information pertained to his federal or state tax returns. He also indicated that he owed 
$3,092 in past-due federal taxes and $4,994 in past-due state taxes.8  
 
 Credit reports from April 2014 and May 2015 reflect that a tax lien of $12,440 
was filed against Applicant in June 2012, and the lien was paid and released in 
November 2012. The reports reflect that Applicant had a $4,382 outstanding lien that 
was filed against him in September 2014. The reports do not reflect any other 
outstanding debts.9 
 
 An April 2015 IRS notice reflected that Applicant had a $16,773 overpayment in 
2010 for tax period 2009. From this overpayment, the IRS applied $10,260 to tax he 
owed for 2010, $900 to tax he owed for 2011, and $3,770 to tax he owed for 2012, and 
Applicant received a $1,917 refund. An April 2016 IRS notice reflected that Applicant 
owed $1,468 in unpaid taxes for tax period 2013, and $861 for tax period 2014.10 
 
 IRS records also reflected that as of August 2016, Applicant filed his 2009, 2011, 
and 2012 federal tax returns in December 2013, and he filed his 2013 and 2014 federal 
tax returns in April 2016. Applicant owed $5,731 for tax period 2009; $4,726 for tax 
period 2011; zero for tax period 2012; $1,485 for tax period 2013; and $873 for tax 
period 2014. As an August 2016 IRS tax return transcript for tax period 2010 reflected

that a return transcript was no longer available, though an account transcript might have 
been, it is unclear when Applicant filed his 2010 taxes.11 
 
 In his Answer, Applicant stated that he cashed out his IRA, took out a loan from 
his 401k, applied most of his wife’s retirement buyout bonus, and made additional 
payments to pay his taxes. He further stated:  
 
The amount listed on the Statement of Reasons for past due Federal 
taxes was incorrect. The taxes had been paid, the amount listed was 
interest owed for filing late. As of today, our federal taxes are current. Our 
state taxes have been filed and we have set up a payment plan to bring 
them current within the next year. 
 
He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims.12 
 
 Applicant indicated that he has been in government service for over forty years 
and his loyalty has never been at issue. He stated that he is a responsible person. He 
further stated that he does not let his debts go unresolved without making an effort to 
see them completely paid in full no matter how long it takes.13   
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
                                                          
11 Item 10. 
 
12 Item 2. 
 
13 Item 2.

Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
 
 
6 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2009 through 
2014, as required, and pay his federal and state taxes. The evidence is sufficient to 
raise AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(f) as disqualifying conditions. 
 
Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Applicant’s belief that his wife took care of their finances and tax reform 
constitute conditions beyond his control that contributed to the untimely filing of his tax 
returns and his delinquent taxes. However, the remaining contributing factors cited by 
him do not constitute conditions beyond his control, and he did not provide evidence to 
show that he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He did not file his 2009, 2011 
and 2012 federal tax returns until December 2013, and his 2013 and 2014 federal tax 
returns until April 2016. While he resolved his 2012 federal taxes, the record shows that 
he only did so in 2015 through the application by the IRS of his overpayment from tax 
 
7 
 
period 2009. He still has outstanding federal and state taxes. There is insufficient 
evidence to conclude that his financial problems are unlikely to recur, and they continue 
to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. 
Circumstances beyond his control only partially contributed to his financial problems, 
but he did not act responsibly under his circumstances. AG ¶¶ 20(a) and 20(b) do not 
apply. 
 
Applicant has not received financial counseling. AG ¶ 20(c) does not apply. As of 
August 2016, Applicant has outstanding federal taxes for tax periods 2009, 2011, 2013, 
and 2014. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that he paid, set 
up a payment plan, or is making payments in accordance with a payment plan to 
resolve his outstanding federal and state taxes.  AG ¶¶ 20 (d) and (g) do not apply. 
 
While Applicant stated in his Answer that the amount listed on the Statement of 
Reasons for past due federal taxes was incorrect, he acknowledged that the amount 
listed was interest owed for filing late. As such, he still has outstanding federal taxes. He 
did not provide documentation to show that he disputed or has taken other actions to 
resolve his outstanding federal taxes. AG ¶ 20(e) does not apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(a):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   
      
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in this whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant retired from the federal government after 33 years of public service. 
Since then, he has been employed by a defense contractor, during which time he 
 
8 
 
rotated every six months until July 2007 between an overseas deployment and working 
in-country. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1971. 
 
While Applicant filed his federal income tax returns from 2009 through 2014, he 
did so only in December 2013 and April 2016. Moreover, his federal and state taxes 
remain unresolved. He failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence 
leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a 
security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the 
security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
