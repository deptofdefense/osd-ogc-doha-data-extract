Decision 
______________ 
 
 
MURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant established that his delinquent debts originated due to circumstances 
beyond his control, and that he undertook good faith efforts to rectify the situation. 
However, he did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial security 
concerns about his long pattern of failing to timely file state and federal income tax 
returns. Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information is revoked. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 5, 2014. On 
December 14, 2016, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006.

On December 10, 2016, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). 
The new AGs became effective on June 8, 2017, for all adjudicative decisions on or 
after that date.1 Any changes resulting from the implementation of the new AGs did not 
affect my decision in this case.  
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on January 6, 2017, and requested a hearing. The 
case was assigned to me on August 18, 2017. On October 27, 2017, a Notice of 
Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for November 17, 2017, a date agreed to by 
the parties. The hearing convened as scheduled.  
 
 Department Counsel submitted Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which 
were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits 
(AE) A through H, and they were admitted without objection.2 I held the record open to 
allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation concerning his tax 
returns. On December 21, 2017, Applicant submitted documents which were marked as 
AE G and AE H and admitted without objection.3 The record closed upon their receipt. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript on December 1, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact  
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g and 1.i-1.l, and he denied SOR ¶ 1.h, all with 
explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough 
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following 
additional findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is 53 years old. He and his wife have been married since 1994. They 
have four grown children. After serving in the Air Force,4 Applicant worked for a defense 
contractor for 14 years, until 2001. He left that job voluntarily to pursue his education, 
and he earned a bachelor’s degree in 2001. Since 2003, he has worked for a defense 
contractor at a naval shipyard. He has held a security clearance since November 2010. 
(Tr. 25-26, 51-52, 56; GE 1) 
 
 On his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had several years of unfiled state and 
federal income tax returns and several delinquent debts. He attributed his debts to 
expenses resulting from his mother-in-law’s care, and to the fact that his wife lost her 
job. (GE 1 at 28-37)   
                                                          
1 Applicant’s counsel confirmed at the hearing that he had received the new AGs. (Transcript (Tr.) 6-7)  
 
2 AE A, AE B and AE C were attached to Applicant’s answer.  
 
3 Applicant’s account transcripts and tax return transcripts for his federal tax returns (tax years 2005-
2016) are grouped together as AE G. Documentation concerning his state tax filings (tax years 2007-
2016) are grouped together as AE H.  
 
4 Applicant served in the Air Force from June 1986 to January 1988. He also served four years in the Air 
National Guard (1988-1992). (GE 1) 
 
3 
 
 
 Applicant’s mother-in-law suffered for many years from a debilitating medical 
condition. She moved in with Applicant and his wife in about 1994, shortly after they 
were married. Her condition worsened, and they moved her to a nursing home in about 
2011. Her condition took a toll on Applicant’s family both emotionally and financially. 
Applicant’s wife had to take significant time away from work to care for her mother. She 
also lost her job in August 2013. She was unemployed for a year. Applicant’s wife was 
earning $65,000 annually, and Applicant’s annual salary was about $78,000 at the time. 
When his wife lost her job, this had a significant impact on the family’s finances. 
Applicant’s mother-in-law died in November 2016. (Tr. 26-30, 43; AE B, AE C) 
 
The SOR includes various consumer, medical and other debts, totaling about 
$6,877 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j). The debts are corroborated by Applicant’s admissions, his 
credit reports, and other documents in the record. (GE 2 – GE 5) All of the alleged debts 
have been paid, or are being paid.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a is a $3,252 credit card debt in collection. Applicant made regular 
payments on the debt through 2016 and 2017, and had $233 left to pay at the time of 
the hearing. (Tr. 34, 35, 46; AE A, AE E) SOR ¶ 1.b ($929) and ¶ 1.c ($794) are 
consumer debts in collection. SOR ¶ 1.f ($130) is owed to a phone company. These 
debts have been paid. (Tr. 35-36, 38; AE E) SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($100), 1.e ($140), 1.g ($82) 
and ¶1.h (a $1,133 judgment) are medical debts. The smaller debts have been paid, 
and the judgment is being paid. (Tr. 37-40; AE A) 
    
The remaining SOR allegations concern Applicant’s repeated failure to timely file 
his state income tax returns for tax years 2005, 2006 and 2010-2013 (SOR ¶1.k) and 
federal income tax returns for tax years 2010-2013 (SOR ¶ 1.l). Applicant admitted the 
allegations in his Answer, but said he had filed all his returns as of March 2014.  
 
From about 2003 to 2005, Applicant lived and worked several hours away from 
his home during the week. It was expensive to live in two places. (Tr. 48, 54-60) For tax 
years 2005 and 2006, Applicant filed his federal returns (AE G), but did not file his state 
income tax returns for these years. He also asserted that he would have gotten a small 
refund had he filed those returns. Years later, after receipt of the SOR, Applicant 
attempted to file those returns, but claimed the state would not accept them. (Tr. 42, 48, 
54-62) Applicant did not provide corroborating documentation that the state would not 
accept his 2005 and 2006 state returns after the hearing. (AE H) 
 
Applicant testified that for tax year 2009, he utilized a tax preparation service. He 
thought they did a poor job, since he was required to pay more than he expected. He 
testified that he prepared his own tax returns in 2010, and owed about $1,800. He 
testified that he and his family were financially strapped and he was unable to pay what 
he owed. He chose not to file, figuring that he would file the next year, when he 
expected a refund. That did not happen. Applicant then failed to file both federal and 
state returns for several years. (Tr. 40-41, 49-50)  
 
4 
 
 
Applicant testified that he began clearing up his tax problems in 2013, and filed 
all his past-due returns by 2015. He said all his tax returns since 2013 have been filed 
on time. He made no excuses for his late filings. (Tr. 41, 50-51, 63-66) 
 
The documentation Applicant submitted after the hearing showed that he filed his 
2007 federal income tax return in late May 2008. He did not file his 2008 federal income 
tax return until July 2010. He filed his 2009 federal return in September 2010. He owed 
a small penalty for late payments each time. (AE G) Applicant did not file his 2007, 2008 
and 2009 state income tax returns until between March and September 2010. He owed 
almost $1,400 for tax year 2007, $86 for tax year 2008, and was refunded about $1,300 
for tax year 2009. (AE H) These late filings were not alleged in the SOR, as they did not 
come to light until after the hearing.5 
 
After Applicant filed these past-due tax returns in 2010, he did not file any state 
or federal tax returns again until late March 2015. That month, he filed his past-due 
state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. (SOR ¶¶ 
1.k, 1.l) All these returns resulted in refunds but for his 2011 federal return, for which he 
owed a small penalty for late payment. (AE G, AE H) Applicant testified that he was 
prompted to file his past-due tax returns as a result of his background interview.6 
 
Applicant also documented the status of his more recent returns. He filed his 
2014 state and federal returns on time, with refunds. He filed his 2015 state and federal 
returns in June 2016. He filed his 2016 state and federal returns on time. For all of these 
tax returns, he received refunds. (AE G, AE H)  
 
Applicant testified that he now earns an annual salary of about $88,000. His wife 
is now a state employee, earning about $42,000 annually. They have a monthly budget. 
He documented several months of recent spending, and established that he generally 
has several hundred dollars left at the end of the month. (Tr. 65-69, AE F) 
 
Applicant’s work-related references attest to his integrity, moral courage, good 
character, work ethic, and loyalty as a team member. He has been recognized for his 
professional and technical expertise. He understands responsibilities of protecting 
classified information. He is a family man, and actively volunteers mentoring local 
youths. (AE D) 
 
 
 
                                                          
5 I cannot consider Applicant’s failure to file tax returns that are not alleged in the SOR as disqualifying 
conduct. However, I can consider that evidence in weighing evidence of mitigation or changed 
circumstances, whether Applicant has demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation, under the whole person 
concept, and in weighing Applicant’s credibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  
 
6 Tr. 41 (“I told my investigator . . . when they started doing my clearance, I explained to her everything, 
and then I started filing in 2014, to make sure I went back and started filing all my taxes, and got them 
straight.”).

Policies 
 
 It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As noted by 
the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”7 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information.

Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns 
under AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required.  
 
 Applicant failed to file his state and federal income tax returns on time as 
required for several years. He also had some delinquent debts. AG ¶¶ 19 (a), (c) and (f) 
apply.  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
 
7 
 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.  
 
 This case has two parts: Applicant’s delinquent debts and his failure to timely file 
federal and state income tax returns. The delinquent debts are resolved. They are 
attributable to two circumstances beyond his control: his mother-in-law’s long term 
serious medical condition, and his wife’s job loss. These circumstances impacted 
Applicant’s finances and resulted in some delinquent debts. Applicant established that 
those debts are now largely resolved, and his finances have also significantly improved. 
AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply to them.  
 
 On the other hand, Applicant’s failure to timely file his state and federal income 
tax returns is extensive and long-term. Applicant filed his federal tax returns on time for 
tax years 2005 and 2006, but did not file his state income tax returns.  
 
 Applicant also filed late state and federal returns for tax years 2007-2009. Most 
of these returns were not filed until 2010. Applicant was applying for a security 
clearance at the time, a circumstance that likely spurred him to act. Those returns are 
not alleged in the SOR, and I have not considered them for disqualifying purposes.8 
 
 Having belatedly cured those unfiled tax returns in 2010, Applicant repeated his 
conduct when he failed to timely file any of his state and federal income tax returns for 
several more years. He did not file his state and federal returns for tax years 2010-2013 
until March 2015, a time when he was again applying for a security clearance.  
 
 Applicant’s unfiled tax returns are not fully attributable to circumstances beyond 
his control. He decided not to file his taxes when he could not pay what he owed. While 
this may be partly attributable to his family’s dire financial straits, his decision not to file 
his state and federal tax returns for several years was not reasonable. AG ¶ 20(b) does 
not apply to them. 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5

(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961).  
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). 
 
Applicant has now filed most of the past-due state and federal returns alleged in 
the SOR. His returns from subsequent years have also been filed, either on time, or 
late. However, I cannot simply adopt a position of “no harm, no foul” or “all’s well that 
ends well.”9 
 
 In ISCR Case No. 14-01243 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 18, 2015), the Appeal Board held 
that timing of debt payments is relevant in evaluating an applicant's case for mitigation. 
As in that case, evidence suggesting that, after years of apparent inattention, Applicant 
was finally energized to come to terms with his overdue tax returns when his clearance 
might be imperiled raises questions about his willingness to follow the sometimes 
complex rules governing classified information when his personal interests are not at 
stake. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01070 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2016), in which the 
Appeal Board held that an applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before 
resolving debts might be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to 
classified information.  
 
 Not once but twice, Applicant waited until his clearance was in jeopardy before 
curing several years of past due tax filings. He filed most of his 2007-2009 returns in 
2010, all of them late.10 These returns are not alleged, but Applicant repeated the 
pattern in 2015, when, as alleged, he filed his returns for tax years 2010 through 2013. 
AG ¶ 20(d) does not apply. 
 
 Given this evidence, Applicant has not established good-faith compliance with his 
tax requirements to show that his prior tax issues are unlikely to recur or no longer casts 
doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness or judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 With respect to AG ¶ 20(g), Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns 
stemming from his unfiled tax returns simply by establishing that those returns have 
now been filed, and that tax returns from subsequent years were largely filed on time. 
The mere fact that Applicant made belated arrangements with appropriate tax 
authorities to file his returns is insufficient to apply AG ¶ 20(g). Moreover, even if AG ¶ 
20(g) applied, Applicant’s eligibility for a clearance does not turn on the application of 
one mitigating condition. 
  
                                                          
9 ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) 
 
10 Applicant also filed his 2007 federal return late, but in September 2008, not in 2010.  
 
 
9 
 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant repeatedly failed to comply 
with rules and regulations in timely filing his state and federal income tax returns. 
Although Applicant resolved his delinquent debts, his demonstrated pattern of 
unwillingness to comply with his legal obligations until his eligibility for a security 
clearance is at stake raises serious security concerns. Those concerns are not resolved 
solely because Applicant has belatedly cured his tax filings. Overall, the record 
evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s continued eligibility for 
access to classified information.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.j:    For Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.k-1.l:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances, presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for 
 
10 
 
 
continued access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is revoked.
