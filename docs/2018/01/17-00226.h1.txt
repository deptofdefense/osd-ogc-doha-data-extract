DAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from delinquent debts and unpaid 
taxes. Based upon evaluation of the testimony, pleadings and exhibits, national security 
eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
History of Case 
 
On August 4, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86). 
On February 16, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines effective within the DoD after September 1, 2006. On June 8, 
2017, new AG were implemented and are effective for decisions issued after that date.1 
                                            
1 I considered the previous AG, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AG, effective June 8, 
2017. My decision would be the same if the case was considered under the previous AG.

 Applicant answered the SOR in writing on March 4, 2017 (Answer), and requested 
a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) assigned the case to me on April 24, 2017. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on 
July 7, 2017, setting the hearing for August 2, 2017. Department Counsel offered 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10 into evidence. Applicant testified, and offered 
Exhibits (AE) A through F into evidence. All exhibits were admitted without objection. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 10, 2017. The record remained 
open until September 15, 2017, to permit submission of additional evidence. Applicant 
timely submitted AE G, which included nine pages, and was admitted without objection.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is 52 years old. He has been married for 16 years. He has a 20-year-old 
daughter from another relationship. He enlisted in the Marines in 1986 and served on 
active duty until 1990. He then enlisted in the Navy Reserve in 1993 and was honorably 
discharged in 2010 as an E-5. (Tr. 22-24) He held a secret and a Top secret security 
clearance while serving. (Tr. 8-9) He completed high school and has earned some college 
credits. He worked for a manufacturing company from 2001 to 2008, when he was laid 
off along with other employees. He worked for a federal contractor from 2011 to 2014. He 
has worked for his current employer since 2014. His wife is employed. (Tr. 24-26) 
 
 Applicant attributed his financial and tax issues to the period of time he was 
unemployed from December 2008, when he lost his position, until August 2011, when he 
started a full-time position with another federal contractor. During that period, he received 
seven months of severance pay and then state unemployment benefits to July 2013. His 
wife was not earning enough money to pay all of their expenses. (Tr. 27-28, 33)  
 
 Applicant filed his 2013 and 2014 federal tax returns in June 2016. He filed his 
2012 federal tax return late.2 (Tr. 41-42; AE G) He timely filed his 2015 and 2016 tax 
returns. (Tr. 42)  
  
 Applicant earns $17.50 an hour. He and his wife each earn about $50,000 
annually. He has health insurance. They do not have a written budget. He said they 
discuss and then pay their bills together. All of their ongoing expenses are current. He 
has not taken credit or financial counseling. (Tr. 29-32)  
 
 Based on credit bureau reports (CBR) from April 2015, August 2016, and August 
2017, the SOR contained 10 allegations: a 2003 Chapter 7 bankruptcy; three delinquent 
debts; two delinquent student loans; and four delinquent federal and state income tax 
debts for years 2012 through 2014. The delinquent debts and unpaid taxes totaled about 
$17,700 and accumulated between 2010 and 2014. (GE 4, GE 5, GE 10.) He disclosed 
                                            
2 The SOR did not allege that Appellant failed to timely file his federal tax returns for 2012, 2013, or 2014. 
That derogatory information will not be considered for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in 
evaluating Applicant’s credibility, in applying the mitigating conditions, and in the analysis of the whole 
person-concept.

delinquent credit card debts and his unpaid taxes in his 2015 SCA. (GE 1) The status of 
each allegation is as follows: 
  
  SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that in December 2003, Applicant discharged $77,338 of 
delinquent debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The majority of that debt consisted of 
unpaid credit cards and an automobile loan. (GE 8) Applicant admitted that he 
accumulated it as a consequence of being financially irresponsible and spending more 
money than he earned. (Tr. 32-33) 
 
  The $5,321 credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.b was charged off in 2011. Applicant’s last 
payment was in 2010. He subsequently made four $100 payments on the debt between 
April and July 2017, after receiving the SOR. The creditor then told him to stop the 
payments because the government prohibited a creditor from collecting a charged-off 
account. (Tr. 34-38; AE G) It is resolved. 
 
  The $3,724 and $3,374 delinquent student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d totaled 
$7,098, and are being resolved. As of August 2017, the balance for the two loans is about 
$2,600. For a period of time, Appellant’s salary was garnished to repay these loans. After 
changing employers in May 2017, he voluntarily began making monthly payments of $400 
on the loans. He intends to continue making the payments until the loans are paid. (Tr. 
38-40; GE 10) They are being resolved. 
 
  Applicant settled the $1,075 auto loan in SOR ¶ 1.e for $750. He paid it in March 
2017. (Tr. 41; AE B)  
   
 Applicant settled the $854 credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.f for $800. He paid it in 
March 2017. (Tr. 40; AE C)  
 
 Applicant owed a total of $3,351 for unpaid federal taxes for years 2012, 2013, and 
2014, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i. In March 2017, he negotiated a payment 
plan with the IRS. He made his first payment of $150 in April 2017. As of August 2017, 
the balance was under $2,800. (Tr. 41-42; AE A, AE D) Post-hearing, Applicant submitted 
documents from the IRS, which indicate his 2013 and 2014 tax debts are resolved. (AE 
G)  
 
 Applicant said he failed to timely file and pay state income taxes for 2013 and 2014, 
as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j. He produced a document from the state indicating that those 
matters are resolved. He said he does not owe money for any tax year. (Tr. 44-46, 49; 
AE D)   
 
 Applicant said he has changed since 2003 when he filed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
He said he would not have had financial problems if he had not lost his job in 2008. He 
emphasized his 20-year military service, during which time he held a security clearance. 
(Tr. 51) He submitted a Letter of Commendation from 2009 that he received for 
exceptional performance of his duty. (AE G)

Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for national security eligibility, the 
administrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations 
for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating 
conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility. 
 
 These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire 
process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of 
variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider 
all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or 
conjecture.  
 
 Directive ¶ E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 states that an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
 A person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national 
security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as 
to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  
 
 Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, “[a]ny determination 
under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national 
interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant 
concerned.” See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information.)

Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
 The security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set 
out in AG ¶ 18, which reads in pertinent part:   
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
 
 AG ¶ 19 describes conditions that could raise security concerns. Three may be 
disqualifying in this case:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant has a history of financial difficulties, which includes a 2003 Chapter 7 
bankruptcy, and debts that became delinquent between 2010 and 2014, as documented 
by his admissions and the CBRs. He has been unable or unwilling to fully satisfy or 
resolve those debts until early 2017. These facts established prima facie support for the 
foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the 
resulting security concerns. 
 
 The guideline includes conditions in AG ¶ 20 that could mitigate the security 
concerns arising from Applicant’s alleged financial difficulties. The following may 
potentially apply:  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear 
 
 
 
 
6 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant admitted that he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2003 as a result of 
mismanaging his finances. That was not a circumstance beyond his control. However, his 
subsequent financial difficulties, beginning in 2010, related to a long period of 
unemployment, which may have been beyond his control. There is insufficient evidence 
documenting that he acted responsibly under those circumstances, which is necessary 
to establish full mitigation. AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies. 
 
Applicant did not provide evidence that he participated in credit or financial 
counseling; however, he presented evidence that he has resolved or is resolving the 
financial delinquencies and they coming under control. He established limited mitigation 
under AG ¶ 20(c). He established some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d), as he is making 
payments on two student loans, paid two debts, and attempted to pay an old credit card 
debt. He resolved his 2013 and 2014 federal taxes and is in compliance with an IRS 
payment plan to resolve his 2012 federal taxes. All state taxes are also resolved. The 
evidence establishes some mitigation under AG ¶ 20(g).   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct 
and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 
 
 
7 
According to AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security 
eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual 
who honorably served in the military for 20 years. He took responsibility for previously 
mismanaging his finances, which resulted in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and the discharge 
of a significant amount of debt in 2003. Between 2010 and 2014, he again encountered 
financial difficulties, which resulted from a long period of unemployment. Although he 
seemingly did not begin to address those difficulties until after receiving the SOR, at this 
point, he has satisfactorily resolved or is resolving the delinquent debts and unpaid taxes. 
During the hearing, he displayed candor and a commitment to financial stability. I have 
no doubt that he will continue to make good-faith efforts to resolve his student loans and 
2012 federal taxes. He is aware that additional financial delinquencies could jeopardize 
his security clearance and employment. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress 
is diminished. Overall, he has successfully met his burden to mitigate the security 
concerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by ¶ E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   FOR APPLICANT 
 
       Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.j:        For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified 
information. National security eligibility is granted.
