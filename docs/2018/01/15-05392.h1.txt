GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations concerns and the Government 
did not establish the personal conduct security concern. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 29, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations) and Guideline E (personal conduct). The action was taken under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and 
the adjudicative guidelines (AG).1 
 
                                                     
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

Applicant responded to the SOR on June 10, 2016, and elected to have his case 
decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 12, 2016, the 
Government converted the case to a hearing, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.7 of the Directive, and 
provided Applicant with the requisite notice. The case was assigned to me on August 
14, 2017. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of 
hearing on August 29, 2017, scheduling the hearing for November 16, 2017.  
 
On November 13, 2017, the Government, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.13 of the Directive, 
amended the SOR to add allegation ¶ 1.u, and provided notice to Applicant through 
Counsel. Counsel objected to the Government’s amendment. Counsel asserted that the 
amended allegation provided a basis for mitigation, not disqualification, and therefore 
was an inappropriate SOR allegation. Counsel also asserted that the Government did 
not have the authority to amend the SOR prior to the hearing. By email dated November 
14, 2017, I notified both parties that the SOR was amended, and I gave Counsel the 
opportunity to continue the hearing to a later date, to allow him additional time to 
prepare. Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled.2 
 
At the hearing, I noted the procedural history concerning the Government’s 
amendment, as set forth above, and that ¶ E3.1.12 of the Directive also permitted the 
Government to amend the SOR prior to the hearing. Counsel renewed his objection, 
which I noted for the record.3   
 
I appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I, II, and III, respectively, the 
Government’s exhibit list and discovery letter, and Applicant’s exhibit list. I admitted 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, 8, and 9 in evidence without objection. Counsel 
objected to the last page of GE 7, asserting that since it referenced Applicant’s prior 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which was not alleged in the SOR, the Government did not 
provide adequate notice that it was a concern. I overruled Counsel’s objection and 
admitted GE 7 in evidence.4  
 
Applicant testified, called one witness, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A 
through EE. I admitted AE A and C through EE in evidence without objection. The 
Government objected to pages 3 through 9 of AE B, asserting that Applicant’s ex-wife’s 
bankruptcy was not relevant. I overruled the Government’s objection and admitted AE B 
in evidence.5 The Government also objected to a six-page document entitled 
“Investigative Standards for Background Investigations for Access to Classified 
Information,” which I marked as AE DD. The Government asserted that the document

was not an official, U.S. Government publication. I sustained the Government’s 
objection and did not admit the document in evidence.6    
 
At Counsel’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the record 
open until November 30, 2017, for additional documentation. Counsel timely provided 
additional evidence, which I marked as AE FF through HH. The Government objected to 
the limited portion of AE FF that Counsel sought to admit in evidence, asserting that it 
was not an official, U.S. Government publication. I overruled the Government’s 
objection and admitted the limited portion of AE FF in evidence. The Government 
objected to AE GG, on the basis that it was double hearsay and the Government did not 
have the opportunity to cross-examine the author. I overruled the Government’s 
objection and admitted AE GG in evidence. The Government objected to AE HH, on the 
basis that it was cumulative. I overruled the Government’s objection and admitted AE 
HH in evidence.7  
 
I appended to the record collectively as HE IV, email correspondence concerning 
the Government’s SOR amendment and AE FF through HH. I also appended to the 
record as HE V the Government’s amendment to the SOR. DOHA received the hearing 
transcript (Tr.) on November 30, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.u, and denied SOR ¶ 2.a. 
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.8 
 
 Applicant is 38 years old. He obtained his high-school diploma in 1999. He 
subsequently attended vocational school and took technical college courses, but he did 
not earn a degree. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from December 1999 until 
September 2004, when he received a General under Honorable Conditions discharge.  
He worked for a prior defense contractor overseas from September 2014 until October 
2016. He then continued to work overseas as a help desk manager for his current 
defense contractor until October 2017, when he was furloughed due to the declination 
of his security clearance. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1999.9 
 
 Applicant married in September 2007 and divorced in September 2012. As of the 
hearing, he was in a relationship since 2015 and cohabitating with her since September 
2017. He does not have any children.10

 The SOR alleges a $2,180 judgment from August 2013; 17 delinquent consumer 
accounts totaling $25,904; 2 delinquent medical accounts totaling $2,379; and a 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in May 2016, with an expected discharge in June 2021. The 
SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified his October 2014 security clearance 
application when he failed to disclose, in response to section 22, his July 2005 felony 
charge. The financial allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions, bankruptcy 
records, and credit reports from October 2014, February 2016, and September 2016. 
He also listed and discussed some of his delinquent debts in his security clearance 
application and during his December 2014 interview.11  
 
 Applicant attributes his delinquent debts and Chapter 13 bankruptcy to his ex-
wife’s mismanagement of their finances, his divorce, his cancer diagnosis in 2013, his 
ex-wife’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in August 2014, and his underemployment. 
After they moved into their first home together in 2003, Applicant and his ex-wife agreed 
that she would manage their finances since he was the primary breadwinner. He was 
unaware that she mismanaged their finances. In 2011, he spoke to his ex-wife after his 
father expressed dismay with how she managed their finances, to include $20,000 he 
and Applicant’s mother lent her. Applicant believed his ex-wife, however, and he 
continued to entrust her with their finances.12   
 
 Applicant acknowledged responsibility for several of the SOR debts. SOR ¶¶ 1.i 
and 1.s are duplicate accounts with the same banking institution for whom he had an 
account. When he left his employer in the state where the bank was located, he 
informed the bank that he was leaving. The bank subsequently conducted certain 
transactions on his account that resulted in insufficient funds. He thought this debt was 
resolved, but discovered when he received the SOR that it was not. SOR ¶ 1.q is a joint 
loan for an ATV, which was sold to pay the loan; as such, he did not include this debt in 
his Chapter 13 bankruptcy.13 
 
 Applicant testified, however, that his ex-wife obtained several accounts in his 
name without his knowledge, to include SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e, 1.k., and 1.r. He did not learn 
about these debts until either the divorce or when he received the SOR. SOR ¶ 1.b is a 
store credit card that his ex-wife obtained in his name, unbeknownst to him, when he 
worked part-time for the store. SOR ¶ 1.k is a cellular phone account that was initially 
for Applicant, his ex-wife, and his parents-in-law. After he removed his name from the 
account so that they would take responsibility for it, they transferred their numbers to a 
different provider. SOR ¶ 1.r is his ex-wife’s primary credit card that she opened in her 
name. Unbeknownst to Applicant, she subsequently added his name and took her name 
off the account. Ultimately, her attitude towards their finances caused him to file 
divorce.14

 As part of the divorce settlement agreement, Applicant testified that the judge 
held his ex-wife responsible for paying a number of the debts she created during the 
marriage. The judge ordered her to pay Applicant a settlement, so that he could then 
pay his ex-wife’s debts. His ex-wife subsequently filed and received a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge, and consequently did not have to pay the debts, Applicant, or his 
father. He did not provide a copy of the divorce decree or his ex-wife’s complete 
bankruptcy paperwork.15  
 
 After his ex-wife’s bankruptcy, Applicant began to try to resolve the outstanding 
debts. He contacted the creditors. He made payments when he could. He sold assets. 
He worked overtime and side jobs. He accepted a job in a different state in June 2013 
that offered increased pay, but was subsequently diagnosed with colon cancer and 
suffered a reduced income. For ethical reasons, he left that job and accepted another 
job in another state in May 2014, at a reduced income. He also bartended part time. He 
accepted his initial contractor job overseas, only to receive an income upon arrival that 
was different from what he expected.16  
 
 Applicant testified that after his October 2014 application and December 2014 
interview, but before the SOR, he consulted with his Government Facility Security 
Officer (FSO) about his delinquent debts and his intent to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy. 
The Government FSO advised him to wait to file bankruptcy until his final security 
clearance was issued. In a June 2016 letter, the Government FSO indicated that 
Applicant brought the SOR to his attention. He indicated that Applicant shared court 
documents with him that revealed much of Applicant’s debt was due to his ex-wife, who 
was ordered to pay them. He also stated in a September 2016 letter that he was “very 
familiar” with the SOR and he “. . . acted as a security advisor to [Applicant].”17  
 
 In May 2016, after consulting with his bankruptcy attorney, his employer’s legal 
department and security manager, and his parents, Applicant filed Chapter 13 
bankruptcy. He elected a Chapter 13 over a Chapter 7 bankruptcy because he 
understood that his creditors would not receive any reimbursement with the latter, 
whereas they would receive either partial or full reimbursement with the former. He 
wanted to take responsibility for his debts. He included all of the SOR debts in the 
bankruptcy, with the exception of SOR ¶ 1.q, as discussed above, and two additional 
non-SOR debts. While not alleged in the SOR, the bankruptcy documentation reflects 
that Applicant included an IRS debt of $10,466 for his 2015 taxes. He testified that he 
does not have any other delinquent debts.18    
 
 As of the hearing, Applicant timely made monthly payments since July 2016, in 
accordance with his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His payments were initially $350 monthly,

but they increased to $525 monthly in October 2016. He expected to continue to make 
his bankruptcy payments accordingly, with the last payment scheduled for June 2021. In 
addition to his Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments, he paid $30,000 in out-of-pocket 
cancer-related medical costs.19 
 
 While not alleged in the SOR, Applicant previously filed and received a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy discharge in 1999, at the age of 18. He did so on his parents’ advice, after 
his car was broken into and his financial information stolen. He reported the matter to 
the police, who later found the culprit. He also reported the identity theft to his creditors. 
Over a period of a few months, however, the culprit made charges totaling $50,000 in 
Applicant’s name. Applicant stated that he also pled guilty to an insufficient bad check 
charge in 1998 because of the culprit’s actions.20  
 
 On his prior contract, Applicant earned $58,000 annually. In October 2016, with 
the new contract, his income increased to $90,000 annually. After he was furloughed in 
October 2017, his income decreased by 65%. His net monthly income was $1,800 as of 
the hearing date. He obtained a part-time job at $8 hourly to extend his financial 
resources. He saved money so that he could sustain himself for a period during the 
furlough, and he lined up a backup job should he have to return stateside to work. He 
expected that he would be able to return to work overseas with the same company if he 
resolved his clearance. He received financial counseling through the Chapter 13 
bankruptcy, and he vaguely recalled receiving similar counseling through his Chapter 7. 
After his divorce, he received financial guidance from a friend who has tax expertise. He 
and his girlfriend keep their finances separate, and he intends to continue to manage 
his finances in the future.21  
 
 In July 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with misdemeanor sexual 
contact without consent. The state’s attorney dropped the charge in January 2006. A 
new state’s attorney charged Applicant with felony attempted second-degree rape and 
misdemeanor sexual contact without consent. A jury trial unanimously acquitted him of 
both charges in April 2006.22  
  
 Applicant testified that he completed an initial security clearance application in 
June 2014. The June 2014 application is not in the record. While he had previously 
completed a similar application, it was in 1999 when he was in military basic training. 
Due to an issue with his fingerprints, he had to redo the June 2014 application, which he 
did electronically, in less than one day, in October 2014.23

 When he initially completed the application in June 2014, he was confused when 
he encountered section 22, which inquired, in one question, whether he had any felony 
charges. He thought he was required to list only felony convictions, as inquired by the 
preceding and succeeding questions, though it also occurred to him that he should list 
his felony charge. He telephoned his then-Assistant FSO (AFSO), who worked 
stateside, for clarification, as his hiring manager had instructed him to work with the 
AFSO to complete the application. The AFSO advised him that he was not required to 
list his felony charge since he was not convicted. The AFSO additionally advised him 
that he was not required to list his felony charge since it occurred eight years prior, and 
were thus outside the seven-year scope of a secret clearance. Applicant followed the 
AFSO’s guidance and responded “No.” When he encountered section 22 for the second 
time, in October 2014, he followed the advice previously given him by his AFSO and did 
not list his felony charge.24  
 
 When he was interviewed by an investigator in December 2014, after his 
company put him in for a top secret clearance, the interviewer told Applicant that a 
longer scope of investigation was required. Applicant stated that he consequently 
volunteered his felony charge to the investigator, as he knew it fell within the longer 
scope of the investigation. He did not intend to falsify his October 2014 application, as 
he had already informed his then-AFSO and his hiring manager about his criminal 
history and delinquent finances. He testified that he understood that he should have 
listed his felony charge.25  
 
 After his October 2014 application and December 2014 interview, and before the 
SOR, Applicant testified that he also discussed his felony charge with his Government 
security officer. As discussed previously, the Government FSO advised him not to make 
any changes to his application until his final security clearance was issued. The 
Government FSO stated in his June 2016 letter, that Applicant brought the SOR to his 
attention and discussed the rape charges with him.26 
 
 Applicant unsuccessfully attempted, before and after the hearing, to locate his 
then-AFSO. When he asked his hiring manager to assist him, he learned that the 
individual no longer worked for the company. The hiring manager stated in an August 
2017 letter that Applicant was offered an overseas position in May 2014, and the 
position required a secret clearance; Applicant followed the directions from the FSO in 
May 2014 when he completed his application; after Applicant was granted an interim 
secret in August 2014, he departed overseas to fill the position; upon arriving overseas, 
his interview was scheduled, and he found out he was submitted for a top secret 
clearance to fill another role, at which point Applicant volunteered the extra data.27

 The vice-president and FSO for Applicant’s company, who has held the position 
since October 2011, attested in a November 2017 letter, that he recalled Applicant 
having questions concerning section 22 of his application. He stated that Applicant was 
advised by the company’s then-AFSO “. . . that he should answer this question ‘NO’ 
since he had been acquitted by a jury and the arrest date was outside the scope of a 
SECRET clearance for which the company was then having him apply.” He 
acknowledged that while the professional advice given to Applicant was, in hindsight, 
incorrect, the advice was given and accepted in good faith. He also attested that 
Applicant disclosed “. . . the full circumstances surrounding his arrest for rape, and how 
it ended with a jury verdict of not guilty on all charges” during the interview process. As 
such, he posited that such disclosures indicate that Applicant intended to be honest. 28  
 
 The vice-president and FSO for Applicant’s company, Applicant’s hiring 
manager, and Applicant’s Government FSO, along with numerous other character 
references, described Applicant as an honest, reliable, and trustworthy individual. They 
recommended him for a clearance. In addition, Applicant presented evidence of coins 
and awards given to him for his distinguished performance.29 
   
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.

 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant has a history of not paying his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise 
AG ¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
 
10 
 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Conditions beyond his control contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. 
Since his divorce, ex-wife’s bankruptcy, cancer diagnosis, and periods of 
underemployment, he has made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. He 
contacted the creditors, made payments when he could, and sold assets. He worked 
overtime and side jobs, and he took jobs with either an increased income or the 
expectation of one. He sold the ATV to resolve the loan in SOR ¶ 1.q. He filed Chapter 
13 bankruptcy in May 2016, and would have likely done so earlier but waited because of 
the advice given him by his Government FSO. He included all of the SOR debts, as well 
as several non-SOR debts, in the bankruptcy, and he does not have any other 
delinquent debts. As of the hearing, he timely made monthly payments in accordance 
with his bankruptcy plan since July 2016, while simultaneously paying $30,000 in out-of-
pocket cancer-related medical costs. He planned to continue to adhere to his 
bankruptcy plan going forward. 
 
A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an 
individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged 
in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she 
need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  
 
While he has unresolved debts remaining, Applicant has demonstrated a good-
faith effort to resolve them and intends to continue to do so. He set aside some savings 
to sustain him during his furlough, he lined up a backup job should he have to return 
stateside, and he took up a part-time job to extend his financial resources. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 
20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are applicable.

Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
  The security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG ¶ 15, as follows: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. 
 
  AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
I considered Applicant’s demeanor at hearing, and he credibly testified that when 
he completed his security clearance application in October 2014, he misunderstood the 
question in which he had to disclose his felony charge, as previously discussed. He 
completed the application electronically, in less than one day. As he had sought 
clarification from his then-AFSO when he initially completed the application in June 
2014, and the advice given to him was that he was not required to disclose it, he 
followed that advice. He had no reason to hide it. He disclosed the rape charges to his 
hiring manager, his then-AFSO, his Government FSO, and the company’s vice-
president and FSO. He also volunteered the information during his December 2014 
interview, upon learning that a longer scope of investigation was required because his 
company put him in for a top secret clearance. AG ¶ 16(a) is not established.    
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. The Government did 
not establish the personal conduct security concern. Applicant has made efforts to 
resolve his debts. While he has unresolved debts remaining, he credibly testified at 
hearing and there is sufficient evidence to show that he is committed to resolving them.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.u:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    FOR APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a:     For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
