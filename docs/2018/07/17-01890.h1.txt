Decision

MENDEZ, Francisco, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns raised 
by her tax-related financial issues. Clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 15, 2017, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent Applicant a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. 
Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. By agreement of the parties, a 
hearing was scheduled for March 1, 2018. 
 
 The hearing was convened as scheduled. Applicant testified and called several 
references as witnesses. The offered exhibits were admitted into the administrative record 
without objection.1 The transcript of the proceeding was received on March 12, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant, 40, is married with three children. She served in the U.S. military from 
July 1996 to November 1998. She has been with her current employer, a federal 
contractor, since November 2014. Her security clearance application does not reflect any

periods of unemployment, except from January to December 2009. Applicant earned an 
associate’s degree in 2011, and is currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree. She earns 
approximately $120,000 annually at her job.2 
 
Applicant did not timely file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 
2004 through 2014. She claims to have been unaware that her former spouse failed to 
file their tax returns until 2010 or 2011, after they divorced. The IRS filed a $3,700 tax lien 
against Applicant in 2012, and a $51,000 tax lien in 2013. Notwithstanding the 
proceeding, Applicant went on leisure travel to the Caribbean in 2012 and 2014.3   
 
As of September 2014, Applicant owed approximately $66,000 in federal income 
taxes for tax years 2004 – 2012. She testified that the current balance is about $72,000. 
Applicant entered into installment agreements with the IRS in the past, but failed to 
comply with the terms of these past agreements. She entered into her current installment 
agreement with the IRS in July 2017, about a month after the SOR was issued. Applicant 
testified that she has made the agreed-upon monthly installment payments.4  
 
IRS account transcripts for the 2004 – 2015 tax years reflect the following:

released the 2012 tax lien for tax years 2004 and 2009. (Exhibit 2 at 70; Exhibit C; Exhibit I at 45.) 
 
6 Exhibit 2 at 8-9. Applicant testified that she has since filed her 2005 federal income tax return, but did not 
provide documentation to corroborate her testimony. (Tr. 63-64.)

amount credited to balance.13 
 
 
Applicant testified that she filed all overdue state tax returns and paid her 
outstanding state tax debt. She provided documentation showing she resolved a 2010 
state tax lien, and paid her 2011 and 2012 state taxes in full. She also resolved a charged-
off debt referenced in SOR 1.d.14

(Tr. 65-66), but did not submit documentation to corroborate her testimony. She claims not to owe for either 
year (Tr. 65), but her current IRS installment agreement (Exhibit E) reflects that she owes for tax year 2014.

Law, Policies, and Regulations 
 
This case is decided under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), which 
became effective on June 8, 2017.  
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). Instead, persons are only eligible for access to classified 
information “upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest” to 
authorize such access. E.O. 10865 § 2. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance, an administrative 
judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory 
explanations, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions. The 
guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human 
behavior, an administrative judge applies the guidelines in a  commonsense manner, 
considering all available and reliable information, in arriving at a fair and impartial 
decision. AG ¶ 2. 
 
Department Counsel must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged 
in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.14. Applicants are responsible for presenting “witnesses and 
other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or 
proven . . . and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable 
clearance decision.” Directive ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
DOHA administrative judges “are creatures of the Directive,”17 who derive their 
authority from the Directive. The Directive also sets forth an administrative judge’s 
responsibilities and obligations, including the requirement that a judge remain fair and 
impartial, and carefully balance the needs for the expedient resolution of a case with the 
demands of due process. Therefore, an administrative judge will ensure that an applicant: 
(a) receives fair notice of the issues, (b) has a reasonable opportunity to address those 
issues, and (c) is not subjected to unfair surprise. Directive, ¶ E3.1.10; ISCR Case No. 
12-01266 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2014). 
 
In evaluating the evidence, a judge applies a “substantial evidence” standard, 
which is something less than a preponderance of the evidence. Specifically, substantial 
evidence is defined as “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.” 
Directive, ¶ E3.1.32.1.18 
                                                          
17 ISCR Case No. 17-01213, n. 2 (App. Bd. June 29, 2018). 
 
18 However, a judge’s mere disbelief of an applicant’s testimony or statements, without actual evidence of 
disqualifying conduct or admission by an applicant to the disqualifying conduct, is not enough to sustain an 
unfavorable finding. ISCR Case No. 15-05565 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2017); ISCR Case No. 02-24452 (App. Bd. 
Aug. 4, 2004). Furthermore, an unfavorable decision cannot be based on matters not alleged in an SOR, 
unless an applicant is provided adequate notice an issue raises a security concern. ISCR Case No. 14-
 
5 
Any doubt raised by the evidence must be resolved in favor of the national security. 
AG ¶ 2(b). See also Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), ¶ E.4. Additionally, 
the Supreme Court has held that responsible officials making “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and 
confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions 
include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or 
inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain 
degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of 
compromise of classified information. ISCR Case No. 11-13626 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 
2013) (“Security clearance adjudications are predictive in nature, and it is foreseeable 
that persons with prior good records may nevertheless engage in conduct or undergo 
circumstances that raise doubts about their future judgment or reliability.”) 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. See AG ¶ 18. 
 
The security concern here is not limited to a consideration of whether a person 
with financial issues might be tempted to compromise classified information or engage in 
other illegality to pay their debts. It also addresses the extent to which the circumstances 
giving rise to delinquent debt cast doubt upon a person’s judgment, self-control, and other 
qualities essential to protecting classified information. See generally ISCR Case No. 11-
05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 In assessing Applicant’s case, I considered the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions listed under Guideline F, including: 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or 
irresponsible spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, 
significant negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, 
or other negative financial indicators; 
 
AG ¶ 19(f): failure to file or . . . failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax as required; 
                                                          
05986 (App. Bd. May 26, 2017). Non-alleged issues can only be used for specific limited purposes, such 
as assessing mitigation and credibility. ISCR Case No. 16-02877 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 2, 2017). 
 
6 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control . . . and the individual acted responsibly 
under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d):  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(g):  the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 An applicant who fails to timely file or pay his or her taxes, a basic and fundamental 
financial obligation of all citizens, bears a heavy burden in mitigating the financial 
considerations security concern.19 An administrative judge should closely examine the 
circumstances giving rise to an applicant’s tax-related issues and his or her response to 
it. Furthermore, an applicant’s claim of financial reform must be weighed against the lack 
of judgment and reliability evidenced by the person’s failure to timely file their income tax 
returns or pay their taxes.20  
 
Applicant failed to meet her burden of proof and persuasion. She failed to timely 
file her federal and state tax returns for over a decade. She continued to file her tax returns 
late and not pay her taxes after her divorce. Although she receives some credit in 
mitigation for filing her overdue tax returns, resolving the non-tax debt referenced in the 
SOR, and apparently resolving her state tax debt; such evidence is insufficient to mitigate 
the serious security concerns raised by her long history of failing to file tax returns and 
pay her taxes. She took action to remedy her overdue federal tax returns and pay her 
back taxes only after the IRS took some form of action. Furthermore, she failed to abide 
by the terms of previous installment agreements; placed her personal leisure travel over 
her legal obligation to pay her federal taxes; and only entered into her current installment 
agreement after the SOR was issued. She provided no documentation to corroborate her 
testimony that she has been making the agreed-upon monthly payments on her current 
installment agreement and her past-due federal tax debt stands at over $50,000. AG ¶¶ 
19(c), 19(e), and 19(f) apply. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply.21 
 
  
                                                          
19 See generally ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (Board explained the heightened 
security concerns raised by tax-related financial issues).

ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016); ISCR Case No. 12-09545 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2015). 
 
21 ISCR Case No. 17-01213 (App. Bd. June 29, 2018) (reversing favorable decision involving an applicant 
with a history of tax issues because no evidence of true financial reform); ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. 
Bd. May 30, 2018) (reversing favorable decision because applicant started taking action to resolve tax issue 
only after IRS initiated enforcement action); ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (reversing 
favorable decision involving applicant who failed to timely file returns for seven years, because 
circumstances contributing to late filing did not mitigate heightened security concerns and applicant took 
remedial action only after being placed on notice clearance was in jeopardy).   
 
7 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 In addition to the specific adjudicative guidelines, a judge must also consider the 
non-exclusive group of factors falling under the whole-person concept.22 I hereby 
incorporate my above analysis and highlight some additional whole-person matters.  
 
 Applicant self-reported the information about her tax problems on her security 
clearance application and timely filed her tax returns for the past two years. She served 
in the military, is a hard worker, and her references vouch for her character. However, 
this and the other favorable record evidence are insufficient to mitigate the security 
concerns raised by Applicant’s long history of failing to file and pay her taxes. Overall, the 
record evidence leaves me with doubts about Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information.23 
 
Formal Findings 
  
Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):      AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:        Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d:        For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record evidence, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of 
national security to grant Applicant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified 
information. Applicant’s request for a security clearance is denied.

23 I also considered the exceptions listed in SEAD 4, Appendix C. However, Applicant did not provide 
sufficient evidence to warrant application of any of the exceptions in Appendix C.
