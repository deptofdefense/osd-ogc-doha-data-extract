NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DOD) intent to deny his 
continued eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security 
concerns raised by his failure to file federal and state income tax returns for a number of 
years between 2001 and 2015, and his $28,052 in unresolved delinquent debt. 
Applicant’s continued access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 24, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s 
security clearance and recommended his case be submitted to an administrative judge 
for consideration. 
                                                          
1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information, implemented on June 8, 2017.

Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing.2 The 
Government submitted its written case on September 30, 2017. A complete copy of the 
file of relevant material (FORM) and the Directive were provided to Applicant. He 
received the FORM on October 24, 2017. He did not respond. The documents 
appended to the FORM are admitted as Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, 
without objection. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant, 59, has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor since 
2007. He was on medical leave from January 2013 to January 2014. Applicant returned 
to his duties in January 2014. He was initially granted a security clearance in 1979, 
during his service in the U.S. Army from 1977 to 1992, and held a security clearance 
continuously until approximately 2003. Applicant completed his most recent security 
clearance application in October 2014 and disclosed derogatory financial information, 
including federal tax issues, a car repossession, and a unpaid medical account.3  
 
The SOR alleges that: Applicant failed to file his 2001 through 2003, 2007 
through 2009, and 2013 through 2015 federal income tax returns, as required (SOR ¶ 
1.a); that he owes $3,200 in outstanding federal taxes for the 2001, 2013 and 2014 tax 
years (SOR ¶ 1.b); Applicant failed to file his 2001 and 2002 state income tax returns, 
as required (SOR ¶ 1.c); and, that Applicant is indebted to nine creditors for $28,052 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d – 1.l). Applicant admits all of the allegations. In response to DOHA 
interrogatories, Applicant provided documentation indicating that he had his federal 
income taxes for 2014 through 2016 prepared in June 2017. He was entitled to a refund 
for 2015 and 2016 and broke even for the 2014 tax year. Applicant did not provide 
documentation showing the prepared returns were actually filed. Applicant did not 
provide documentation showing the outstanding state income tax returns were filed. All 
of the debts alleged in the SOR, including the outstanding federal tax balance remains 
unresolved.4  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, 
administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the 
adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, 
impartial, and commonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision.

3 GE 3, 7. 
 
4 GE 2, 4-6, 7.

The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence. 
  
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations 
may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgement, or willingness to abide by rules and 
regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.5 
 
The record establishes the Government’s prima facie case that Applicant has a 
history of not meeting financial obligations6 and that he failed to file his federal and state 
income taxes and pay federal income taxes, as required.7 Applicant did not submit 
sufficient information to mitigate the alleged concerns. All of the concerns alleged in the 
SOR remain unresolved. Accordingly, none of the financial considerations mitigating 
conditions apply.  
 
Based on the record, doubts remain about Applicant’s ongoing suitability for 
access to classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the 
whole-person factors at AG ¶ 2(d). After the Government presents evidence raising 
security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those 
concerns.8 An applicant is reasonably expected to provide corroborating documentation 
regarding his financial interests. Applicant failed to do so. As a result, he did not meet 
his burdens of production and persuasion to refute or mitigate the financial 
considerations allegations.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:

 Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.l:      Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 Based on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information 
is denied.
