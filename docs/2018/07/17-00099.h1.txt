MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on September 1, 
2015. On March 14, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2017, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. The Government was ready to proceed on May 24, 2017, and 
the case was assigned to me on December 4, 2017. On January 30, 2018, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for February 22, 2018. Applicant was granted a continuance on February 21, 
 
FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY                                                            2

2018. On March 7, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified 
Applicant that the hearing was rescheduled to April 4, 2018, which I convened as 
scheduled.  
 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence, without 
objection. I appended to the record the Government’s exhibit list as Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) I and correspondence the Government sent to Applicant as HE II. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K, which I admitted 
into evidence, without objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open until May 
11, 2018. Applicant timely provided additional documents that were admitted into 
evidence as AE L through DD, without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
April 13, 2018. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG (2017 AG).1 Accordingly, I have 
applied the 2017 AG.2 However, I have also considered the 2006 AG, because they 
were in effect on the date the SOR was issued. I conclude that my decision would have 
been the same under either version. 
 
Findings of Fact3 
 
Applicant, age 49, divorced her first husband in 1996 and her second husband in 
2004. She is presently engaged to be married. She had three children, two of whom are 
living, ages 21 and 27. She obtained her high school diploma in 1987. Applicant has 
worked as a contractor for the same U.S. Government agency for almost 14 years 
through various employers. Applicant was granted a security clearance in approximately 
2003.4 
 
 The SOR alleged a 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge and 22 post-
bankruptcy delinquent debts totaling $59,602 (Guideline F), and that Applicant failed to 
disclose any delinquent debts on her 2015 security clearance application (SCA) 
(Guideline E). Applicant admitted each of the Guideline F allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a 
through 1.w), and denied each of the Guideline E allegations (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b).5  
                                                          
1 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD 4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD 4 ¶ B, Purpose). The 
SEAD 4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD 4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The new AG, which are found at 
Appendix A to SEAD 4, apply to determine eligibility for initial or continued access to classified national 
security information. (SEAD 4 ¶ C, Applicability).

current DOD policy and standards).

Guideline F 
 
Applicant initially experienced financial problems because of her second divorce, 
which was finalized in December 2004 after a period of separation that began in August 
2003. She was left with substantial debts that had not been allocated to her second 
husband. To resolve those debts, at the advice of her counsel, Applicant filed for 
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2004. The debts were discharged in December 
2004.6 
 
After the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant’s financial issues persisted due to 
various events that impacted her emotionally and financially. In 2007, her son was 
tragically killed at the age of 17. In 2009, she was laid off for a period unspecified in the 
record. She suffered three strokes and other medical conditions between 2007 through 
2015. In 2015, her oldest daughter lost a child during childbirth. In 2016, her youngest 
daughter lost her father, and Applicant’s partner of 10 years passed away. As of the 
hearing, Applicant’s mother had recently been diagnosed with several medical 
conditions.7  
 
While Applicant received child support for all three of her children, it was 
insufficient to meet their expenses. She received $50 a month for her son before he 
passed away, $55 per month for her oldest daughter, which ended when she turned 18, 
and $564 per month for her youngest daughter, which ended when her father passed 
away.8 At various times, Applicant had been providing financial support to her two adult 
daughters and her youngest daughter’s child. After her youngest daughter’s social 
security number was inadvertently used for her father’s death certificate in 2016, it took 
two years to resolve the issue, which resulted in increased support needs from 
Applicant.9 
 
 In April 2016, Applicant engaged the services of a credit restoration company 
(Company A) and a credit monitoring company (Company B), neither of which assisted 
her with paying any debts. She paid an $87 enrollment fee plus $87 per month to 
Company A to have items removed from her credit report, and paid unspecified sums 
on a monthly basis to Company B to monitor her credit. Applicant did not specify the 
time period during which she paid and worked with either company, but she eventually 
terminated her relationships with them because she could not afford the monthly 
payments. Applicant believed that her efforts to work with those two companies would 
suffice to mitigate the security concerns about her finances. Applicant stated that she

“looking” into it.10 
 
In June 2016, Company A sent letters on Applicant’s behalf to three credit 
bureau agencies disputing numerous SOR debts on the basis that the accounts did not 
belong to Applicant.11 At the hearing, Applicant acknowledged the dishonesty of those 
letters given that the accounts did, in fact, belong to her.12 She claimed to have sent 
“hardship” letters to numerous creditors, but only provided one such letter that she sent 
to a prospective landlord.13 After the hearing, Applicant engaged the services of another 
credit repair company, but provided no evidence that it has assisted her with anything 
more than removing items from her credit report.14 
 
 Applicant did not provide any documentary evidence that she paid any of her 
SOR debts, except for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.15 Several debts were removed 
from her credit report, but not because Applicant had any legitimate basis to dispute 
them. The status of Applicant’s SOR debts, based on the record evidence, is as follows:

 Applicant revealed, for the first time at the hearing, that she owed the IRS $7,000 
for unpaid income taxes from tax year 2015. She incurred the taxes because she did 
not understand the rules and tax consequences associated with her health savings 
account. The IRS intercepted one of Applicant’s federal income tax refunds to pay a 
portion of the taxes owed. The remaining balance is approximately $4,500 or $5,000, 
which Applicant plans to pay through the IRS’s interception of future federal income tax 
refunds. She also revealed that, in an unspecified tax year, her state income tax refund 
was intercepted to pay a delinquent property tax debt.33  
 
 Applicant’s annual salary from her full-time job has fluctuated from $130,000 (in 
2016 and 2017) to $50,000 (in 2018). Applicant has earned approximately $50 to $100 
per week from a part-time job. Applicant asserted that her $130,000 salary was 
insufficient to meet her expenses because she was providing financial support to two 
children and her youngest daughter’s child, who were also then living with her. She no 
longer provides that financial support and was able to reduce her rent from $3,000 per 
month to $1,750 per month. In 2018, her car insurance decreased from $700 per month 
to $200 per month.34  
 
Guideline E 
 
Applicant did not disclose her automobile repossessions or any other financial 
issues on her September 2015 SCA.35 In December 2015 and on several occasions

thereafter, a DOD authorized investigator interviewed Applicant to discuss her 
responses to the SCA and other matters related to her security clearance background 
investigation, including her financial issues.36   
 
 During her first interview, Applicant volunteered, before being confronted, that 
she had three cars repossessed, and claimed that she did not list them on her SCA 
because she could not recall the details. She answered “no” when asked whether she 
had any additional financial issues. Applicant was then confronted with additional 
delinquent debts, to which she either denied any knowledge that they were delinquent 
or denied any knowledge of them at all. She denied owing any balances on the loans for 
the cars that were repossessed. She promised to research them and pay any debts 
deemed legitimate.37 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant explained that she did not report her automobile 
repossessions on her SCA because she populated her responses electronically using 
the data from a 2003 SCA, which did not list any financial issues. She was rushed at the 
time so she did not take the time to more carefully review her responses. Applicant now 
understands the impact of omitting derogatory information from an SCA and promised 
to avoid doing so on future SCAs.38 
 
Whole Person 
 
Applicant’s work performance, character, and trustworthiness are highly 
regarded.39 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”40 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”41 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”42

Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”43 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.44 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”45 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.46 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.47 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.48

An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”49 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”50 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.51  
 
 Applicant’s Chapter 7 bankruptcy and post-bankruptcy delinquent debts establish 
two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) 
and AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR under this guideline have not been 
mitigated by any of the following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;

Exemption 6 applies                                                 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements.52 
 
Applicant has substantial unresolved delinquent debts, including unalleged 
delinquent tax debt. While her delinquent debts resulted from circumstances largely 
beyond her control, Applicant did not act responsibly to address them. Hiring a company 
to assist her with having debts deleted from her credit reports by falsely claiming that 
they did not belong to her is not a “good-faith” effort to resolve Applicant’s debts. 
Applicant did not establish, by substantial evidence, the payment or other resolution of 
any SOR debt except for that alleged in ¶ 1.a. Even after the record was left open for an 
extended period after her hearing, Applicant did not pay or make arrangements to pay 
her delinquent debts. I cannot conclude that her financial problems are under control or 
not likely to recur. Even if each of the SOR debts were successfully removed from 
Applicant’s credit reports, concerns would persist about her reliability, trustworthiness, 
and good judgment given that she had no reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of 
any of her delinquent debts. 
 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result 
in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security 
                                                          
52 Since tax issues were not alleged in the SOR and there was no amendment to the SOR to include the 
tax issue, I am considering Applicant’s tax issues for mitigating and not disqualifying purposes.

clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security 
eligibility: 
 
(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo 
or cooperate with security processing, including but not 
limited to meeting with a security investigator for subject 
interview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation 
with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph 
examination, if authorized and required; and 
(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to 
lawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other 
official representatives in connection with a personnel 
security or trustworthiness determination. 
 
The omissions of Applicant’s automobile repossessions and delinquent debts 
from her SCA renders the following disqualifying condition under this guideline 
potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history 
statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine 
employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national 
security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. 
 
When a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of 
proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative 
judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant’s state of 
mind at the time of the omission. An applicant’s level of education and business 
experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information 
on a security clearance application was deliberate.   
 
I did not find credible Applicant’s explanations and excuses for failing to report 
her known derogatory financial information on her SCA. At the time that she certified her 
SCA, she knew that she had three automobile repossessions even if she did not know 
details about them or her other delinquent debts. I find substantial evidence of an intent 
on the part of the Applicant to omit security-significant facts from her SCA. Therefore, 
AG ¶ 16(a) is established. 
 
The following are potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the 
omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the 
facts; and 
 
AG ¶ 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the 
behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique

circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
 
Applicant self-reported her known automobile repossessions during her interview 
before being confronted with them. She was unaware of other delinquent debts at the 
time she completed her SCA. Applicant understands the impact of omitting derogatory 
information from an SCA and promised that she would avoid doing so on future SCAs. 
Having observed her demeanor at the hearing on this topic to be sincere and credible, I 
am convinced that her lack of candor is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on her 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 17(a) and (c) apply. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
adjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole 
person. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors 
listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the whole-person factors in AG ¶ 2(d). Applicant has 
certainly endured a tremendous amount of loss and heartache over the years. By all 
accounts, she has maintained her professionalism and stellar work ethic throughout 
those challenges, for which she should be commended. However, these facts do not 
suffice to overcome the security concerns raised by her persistent financial 
indebtedness. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under 
Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I 
conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her personal 
conduct, but not those raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has 
not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant her eligibility for access to classified information.

Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a:   For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.b – 1.w:  Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 2.a – 2.b:  For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
