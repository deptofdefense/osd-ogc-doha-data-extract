Decision

KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his 
problematic financial history. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on April 4, 2016. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On January 17, 2018, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations. 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.

Applicant answered the SOR on February 9, 2018, and requested a decision based on 
the written record without a hearing.   
 
On March 26, 2018, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on March 27, 2018. He was given thirty 
days to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on April 4, 2018. Applicant  
responded to the FORM on May 2, 2018. The case was assigned to me on June 29, 
2018.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Applicant’s response to the FORM included documents that I have marked as 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A and B and which are admitted into evidence without objection. 
Included in the FORM were eight items of evidence. Items 3 through 8 are marked as 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 and are admitted into evidence without objection.3 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 56 years old and holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees. He is 
divorced (since 1992) and has no children. Since August 2015, Applicant has been 
employed by a defense contractor.4 
 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy 
in November 2011 that was discharged in March 2012. The SOR also alleges that he is 
indebted to the federal government on a 2012 tax lien in the amount of $76,406.5 
Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations. Tenants occupying his rental 
properties failed to pay the rent. In addition, the record shows that Applicant had a lengthy 
period of part-time employment, from January 2008 until August 2015. Those 
circumstances caused him to resort to credit card over-use. Ultimately, Applicant retained 
counsel, who recommended filing for Chapter 7 protection, which he did. He landed his 
current full-time job in August 2015.6 At the time of his answer to the SOR (February 
2018), Applicant stated that he was in the process of refinancing his principal residence 
to free up its equity. He also stated that he contacted the IRS about a payment plan but 
that he did not follow through, because he thought his refinancing would make such a 
                                                          
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documents, 
some of which documents are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 Items 1 and 2 are the SOR and Applicant’s Answer, respectively. Those are the pleadings in this case 
and, therefore, they are not marked as exhibits.

plan unnecessary.7 Applicant’s May 2, 2018 response to the FORM included 
documentary evidence of his payment plan with the IRS ($2,000 per month). Those 
documents, however, showed that only one payment had been received by IRS, on March 
30, 2018, and a total owed of $168,004.  Those documents also showed that he had filed 
his federal income tax returns for 2014 through 2017. Applicant’s tax delinquencies run 
from 2009 through 2013.8  
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.9 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”10 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.11 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.12 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.13 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.14 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.15 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.16 In Egan, the Supreme

Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are 
reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.18 
 
     Discussion 
  
Guideline F - Financial Considerations  
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,19 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.20 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
 AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; 
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file . . .  annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns 
or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;

AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to a SOR require no further proof by 
the Government.21  The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a 
problematic financial history, as alleged. This raises security concerns under AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
(c), and (f).  The next inquiry is whether any potentially mitigating conditions apply. 
 
Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to a combination of two conditions. The 
first was his tenants failing to pay the rent they owed. The second was Applicant’s lengthy 
period of under-employment. Those conditions are unlikely to recur and are 
circumstances largely beyond his control under AG ¶ 20(b). The next inquiry is whether 
he acted responsibly in light of the circumstances.    
 
Applicant stayed financially afloat for a while using credit cards, but at some point 
he sought legal counsel and followed counsel’s advice to seek Chapter 7 protection in 
2011. That was a responsible step under the circumstances. SOR ⁋ 1.a is mitigated under 
AG ¶¶ 20 (a) and (b).    
 
Applicant’s federal tax issue, however, presents a different problem. His tax 
delinquencies run from 2009, before his Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, through 2013, 
and they remain currently delinquent. Applicant’s period of under-employment (January 
2008 – August 2015) arguably explains why he did not address his tax issues in that time 
period. Applicant regained full-time employment in August 2015. Yet it was not until March 
2018, after the SOR was issued and the FORM was submitted, that he set up a payment 
plan with the IRS. The inference is unmistakable that the issuance of the SOR and the 
filing of the FORM prompted Applicant to address his delinquent federal income tax debts. 
Being forced by the security clearance process to pay legitimate debts is not a good-faith 
effort to resolve those debts.22 Moreover, the Appeal Board has held that applicants need 
to show a “meaningful track record” of adherence to a payment plan.23 One payment does 
                                                          
21 ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made to the SOR 
allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 
(App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n applicant’s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal 
basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).

21, 2009).

not constitute a meaningful track record of repayment. Applicant’s federal income tax 
indebtedness has not been fully mitigated under AG ¶¶ 20(a), (b), or (g).  
 
 The evidence of Applicant’s financial condition raises doubts about his reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable 
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due 
consideration to the whole-person concept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has 
not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
     Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.b:                   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
