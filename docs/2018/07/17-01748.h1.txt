HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant made sufficient progress resolving the delinquent debts alleged on his 
statement of reasons (SOR). Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.            
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On September 22, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On June 2, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility 
for Access to Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs). 
(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F.  
 
On June 21, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On November 9, 2017, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On January 18, 2018, the case was assigned 
to another Administrative Judge. On February 12, 2018, the case was transferred to me 
for administrative reasons. On March 14, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and 
 
2 
                                         
 
Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for April 2, 2018. (HE 1) 
Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant offered 
three exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 18-23; GE 1-5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE C) On April 12, 2018, DOHA 
received the hearing transcript. Seven exhibits were provided after the hearing, and they 
were admitted without objection. (AE D-AE J) The record closed on May 2, 2018. (Tr. 45, 
47) 
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive 
Position (AGs), which he made applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position on or after June 8, 2017. The new AGs supersede the previous AGs. Accordingly, 
I have evaluated Applicant’s security clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. He also 
provided extenuating and mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings 
of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old cyber-security engineer and program manager who has 
worked for a government contractor since 2010. (Tr. 7-8) In 1985, he graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 7) He attended college; however, he did not receive a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 
8) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 8) In 1998, he married, and his children are ages 
13 and 18. (Tr. 9)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant and his spouse separated in 2014, and Applicant became responsible 
for funding two households. (Tr. 26, 28) His spouse was unemployed for four months in 
2014, for five months in 2016, and for several months in 2017. (Tr. 28) He had insufficient 
income and some debts became delinquent. (Tr. 26) His net monthly income after 
withholding for taxes is about $6,000. (Tr. 36) He provides about $500 monthly to his 
spouse for support. (Tr. 37) He also pays child support. The SOR alleges three delinquent 
debts totaling $17,139 and their status is as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt owed to a bank for $13,988. The debt 
originated as a home-equity loan in about 2007. (Tr. 26-27) The debt became delinquent 
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/SEAD4 20170608.pdf.    
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 
                                         
 
in 2016. (Tr. 28) On February 16, 2018, the creditor agreed to settle the debt for $9,000 
with a payment of $4,500 on or before February 23, 2018, and the remainder to be paid 
on or before August 23, 2018. (AE B) Applicant borrowed from his 401(k) account, and 
on February 26, 2018, Applicant paid $4,500. (Tr. 26; AE B) The creditor accepted the 
payment. Applicant promised to pay the remaining $4,500 on or before August 23, 2018. 
(Tr. 24, 42; AE B)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off debt owed to a bank for $2,640. Applicant 
borrowed the funds to install windows in his home. (Tr. 29) Payments were stopped in 
2013. (Tr. 29) Applicant’s spouse handled the debt payments when he was living with 
her, and he was unaware that she stopped making payments to this creditor in 2013. (Tr. 
30) The creditor offered to settle the debt for $396 over the telephone, and Applicant 
planned to settle the debt as soon as he receives written verification of the settlement 
offer. (Tr. 25, 30-31) On April 9, 2018, Applicant paid the creditor $198. (AE E) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a delinquent medical debt for $511. Appellant is checking his 
medical insurance concerning responsibility for this debt. (Tr. 25) The creditor recently 
transferred the debt, and Applicant was unable to validate the debt. (Tr. 32) At his hearing, 
he promised to pay it as soon as he is able to validate it. (Tr. 32, 42) After his hearing, 
the creditor agreed to settle the debt for $105, and on April 10, 2018, Applicant paid the 
debt. (AE E) 
 
Applicant’s $133,000 mortgage was $7,000 past due. (Tr. 32; AE C) Applicant filed 
a quitclaim deed on February 23, 2018. (Tr. 32; AE C) Applicant’s spouse is taking full 
responsibility for the mortgage, and she has entered a state-sponsored mortgage loan 
rehabilitation program (SSMLRP) that is based on her income. (Tr. 32) The SSMLRP paid 
$7,000 to bring the mortgage current, paid the $1,820 real estate tax, and is paying the 
mortgage from March 2018 through November 2018. (Tr. 33, 39-40; AE C) Their 
mortgage is no longer delinquent. (Tr. 33) Applicant paid off a debt for $2,400 to a home-
improvement store. (Tr. 35) He is paying $100 monthly to address a city tax debt. (Tr. 35)  
 
Five character references lauded Applicant’s diligence, reliability, responsibility, 
and trustworthiness. (AE A; AE G) Their statements support approval or continuation of 
his security clearance.  
   
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
4 
                                         
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
   
  
 
6 
                                         
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
Applicant’s spouse had several periods of unemployment. Applicant and his 
spouse are separated. These are circumstances beyond his control that adversely 
affected his finances.  
 
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts. Applicant and the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a 
reached a settlement agreement to resolve the debt for $9,000. On February 26, 2018, 
Applicant paid $4,500, and Applicant promised to pay the remaining $4,500 on or before 
August 23, 2018. The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b agreed to settle the debt for $396, and on 
April 9, 2018, Applicant paid the creditor $198. He promised to pay the remaining $198. 
The creditor in SOR ¶ 1.c agreed to settle the debt for $105, and on April 10, 2018, 
Applicant paid the debt.  
 
Applicant paid one SOR debt, and the other two debts are in established payment 
plans. He needs to pay $4,700 to resolve the last two debts, and he promised to pay the 
creditors. There are clear indications that his financial problem is resolved, and his 
finances are under control. Future financial problems are unlikely to occur. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 
20(b), and 20(d) are established, and financial considerations security concerns are 
mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old cyber-security engineer and program manager who has 
worked for government contractors since 2010. He attended college; however, he did not 
receive a bachelor’s degree.  Five character references praised Applicant’s diligence, 
reliability, responsibility, and trustworthiness.    
 
 
8 
                                         
 
Applicant’s SOR alleges three delinquent debts. He paid one SOR debt and the 
other two SOR debts are in established payment plans. He paid or resolved several non-
SOR debts. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis 
in financial cases stating:  
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and 
every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial 
problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge 
can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and 
his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the 
reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See 
Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching 
a determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments 
on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and 
concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a 
time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in 
furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). Applicant has established a track record of paying his debts. 
 
Applicant does not have any delinquent debts. His actions show financial 
responsibility and judgment and favorably resolve questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. Future financial 
problems are unlikely to occur.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial consideration concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  For Applicant 
     
  
 
9 
                                         
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
