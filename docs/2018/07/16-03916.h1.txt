GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 30 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG).1 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on February 23, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2017. 
                                                          
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on 
January 26, 2018, scheduling the hearing for February 16, 2018. On January 30, 2018, 
Department Counsel amended the SOR, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.17 of the Directive, to add 
an allegation numbered SOR ¶ 1.t under Guideline F. Applicant responded on the same 
date and admitted the allegation.2 I marked the amendment and Applicant’s response 
as Hearing Exhibit (HE) III. 
 
I convened the hearing as scheduled. The Government’s demonstrative chart 
and exhibit list were appended to the record as HE I and II. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 10 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called two 
witnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through W, which were admitted in 
evidence without objection.                                                                                                                      
  
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from Department Counsel, I left the 
record open until March 30, 2018, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. 
After the record closed, Applicant provided additional evidence on May 29, 2018, which 
I marked as AE X. I admitted AE X into evidence without objection. I marked as HE IV 
Department Counsel’s email in which he indicated that he did not object to AE X. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 27, 2018.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.d, 1.f to 1.l, and 1.p to 1.t. 
She denied ¶ 1.m, indicating that it was a duplicate of ¶ 1.l. She neither admitted nor 
denied ¶¶ 1.e, 1.n, and 1.o.3 
 
 Applicant is 48 years old. She was married in 1996, divorced in 2005, and 
engaged to be married as of the date of the hearing. She has two adult children, both of 
whom were living with her.4  
 
 Applicant graduated from high school in 1988, and she subsequently attended 
and received a certification from a trade school in 1989. She worked as a federal 
government civilian from 1989 to around 2006. She has since worked for defense 
contractors, but was unemployed from March 2014 until April 2015 due to a layoff. She 
began working for her current defense contractor in around June 2015. To supplement 
her income, she had a part-time fashion business from 2013 until her layoff. She also 
had a part-time desktop publishing business from 2015 to 2016, which she stopped 
because she saw more losses than gains. She was first granted a DOD security 
clearance at the age of 19.5

 The SOR alleges an April 2015 federal tax lien of $32,689 (¶ 1.j), two judgments 
from January 2012 and February 2014 totaling $28,172 (¶¶ 1.k - 1.l), eight delinquent 
consumer accounts totaling $77,131 (¶¶ 1.a - 1.d, 1.h, 1.m, 1.p, 1.s), and seven 
delinquent medical accounts totaling $1,216 (¶¶ 1.e - 1.g, 1.i, 1.n - 1.o, 1.q). It alleges 
that Applicant’s wages were garnished by her employer in around April 2006 for 
$10,478 (¶ 1.r). It alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2017 (¶ 1.t). 
The SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions, state court lien records, 
credit reports from March 2015, November 2016, and January 2018, and bankruptcy 
records. Applicant also listed and discussed her delinquent debts in her 2015 security 
clearance application (SCA) and during her 2016 background interview.6  
 
 Applicant attributes some of her delinquent debts to her divorce. In June 2012, 
she got into a car accident and was consequently out of work until January 2013. When 
her father passed away in January 2013, she had to assist with funeral obligations. She 
was laid off in March 2014 and subsequently unemployed until April 2015. She 
supported herself through unemployment benefits of $359 weekly, for a maximum of 
$9,334, from April 2014 to April 2015. Sometime after she began working for her current 
defense contractor, she was moved to a program in which she suffered a $6,000 pay 
cut. Her parking costs at work increased. She feels her homeowner’s association (HOA) 
is dishonest and inaccurate, as further discussed below. She has had health issues 
since 2008, her children have also had health issues, and her fiancé has cancer.7  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a is for a real estate mortgage account on Applicant’s condominium that 
she purchased in May 2007. As of the SOR, the account was $48,152 past due with a 
total balance of $386,838. It became delinquent in 2014, after she was laid off. She did 
not make any mortgage payments from November 2014 to April 2015. She attempted to 
short sell the home, but she did not receive an offer until nearly a year had passed and 
the offer was rejected in August 2016. She had difficulty selling her home because she 
has had a roofing problem since at least late 2016, which has caused water to leak into 
her home. Despite her attempts to get her HOA to repair her roof, the problem persisted 
as of the hearing date. In August 2016, she started the mortgage modification process. 
She was approved in January 2017, her mortgage was modified to $1,934 monthly, and 
she has since been current.8 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b is for a credit card debt incurred during Applicant’s prior marriage that 
was charged off for $1,604. She believed it was paid, but learned it was not after her 
divorce. As of February 2017, she paid $827 and a remaining balance of $777 was due. 
She listed this debt in her bankruptcy case.9

 SOR ¶ 1.c is for a store credit card also incurred during Applicant’s prior 
marriage. It was charged off for $330. She also believed it was paid, until the creditor 
informed her that it was outstanding. She indicated that when she tried to pay it, she 
was told that she could not do so because of the statute of limitations.10 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.h are accounts related to her son’s musical instruments, 
delinquent for a total of $390. Applicant paid the accounts in 2012.11 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.q are seven delinquent medical debts 
totaling $1,216. SOR ¶ 1.e was for a visit to an ear, nose, and throat doctor in around 
2008 that Applicant believed she had paid. When she attempted to contact the doctor’s 
office, she learned that it was no longer in business. As the debt was not reported on 
her credit reports, she did not list it in her bankruptcy case. She was willing to pay it 
once she located the creditor. She paid SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i as of February 2017. 
She incurred SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g during her prior marriage. SOR ¶ 1.i was an old debt 
for which she had to research and locate the creditor to pay it. She had no knowledge of 
the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o, and both were not reported in her recent 
credit reports. She paid SOR ¶ 1.q in November 2015.12 
 
 In April 2015, the IRS placed a federal tax lien against Applicant for $32,689, as 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j. The circumstances that led to the IRS lien were discussed by 
Applicant’s tax preparer, who testified at the hearing as set forth below. As of November 
2016, Applicant owed $18,900 in federal taxes for tax year 2008, $1,200 in federal taxes 
for tax year 2009, and $4,500 in federal taxes for tax year 2011. She indicated that she 
was due federal refunds for tax years 2012, 2013, 2015, and 2016. She believed her 
outstanding federal taxes for tax year 2008 were resolved through the interception of 
her subsequent federal and state tax refunds. She believed she owed around $6,000 in 
federal taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011. She intended to provide 
documentation to corroborate her claims. For tax year 2014, the IRS indicated that she 
owed $32,000, however her tax preparer was awaiting the IRS response to an 
amendment he submitted, which he believed would reduce her liability to $10,000, as 
discussed below.13  
 
 Applicant worked with three tax preparers from around 2008 through the date of 
the hearing. The first individual prepared her tax returns for 2008 through 2011. The 
second tax preparer, who testified at Applicant’s hearing as discussed below, prepared 
her tax returns for 2012 and 2013, and assisted her with resolving the issues that arose 
out of her prior and subsequent tax returns. A third individual prepared her tax returns 
for 2014 and 2015, when the second tax preparer was unavailable. As of the date of the

hearing, she was current on her federal and state filings, and she expected to timely file 
her tax returns for 2017 with the assistance of the second tax preparer.14 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k is for a $14,424 judgment filed against Applicant in 2014 by her HOA 
for delinquent HOA dues. Applicant first became delinquent with her HOA dues of $199 
monthly in 2009, when she had to care for her ill mother. She was delinquent for six 
months. She requested a payment plan with her HOA, her request was denied, and the 
HOA then placed a lien against her property. She testified that her mother recovered 
and she was subsequently able to bring her HOA dues current.15 
 
 After the 2012 car accident, Applicant again became delinquent on her HOA 
dues and the HOA obtained a judgment against her. Her HOA dues also increased to 
$250 monthly after she unsuccessfully attempted to renegotiate them after the short 
sale of her home fell through. She included the judgment and delinquent HOA dues in 
her bankruptcy. While she made a payment on her HOA dues when she filed 
bankruptcy, and she made a few additional payments on them thereafter, she had not 
made consistent payments because the HOA had yet to fix her roofing problem. As of 
the date of the hearing, she had not paid her HOA dues since September 2017, in 
addition to the outstanding judgment. Since she filed bankruptcy, she estimated that she 
has saved $200 monthly for a total of $2,000, which she intended to apply towards her 
outstanding HOA dues once her bankruptcy was finalized.16 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m are duplicate accounts for a personal loan Applicant 
obtained in 2010. She initially fell delinquent after her car accident in 2012. In January 
2013, the creditor obtained a $13,748 judgment against her after the account was 
charged off for $7,543. Though she entered into a payment arrangement with the 
creditor, she became delinquent again after she was laid off in February 2014. She 
made a payment with some of the money that she withdrew from her 401(k). With the 
help from her bankruptcy attorney, Applicant’s wages were voluntarily garnished 
beginning in July 2015 for $325 monthly, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.r, to resolve this debt. 
She included the debts in her bankruptcy case. After she filed bankruptcy, she received 
notification from the creditor indicating the debts were resolved. Her wages were not 
being garnished as of the date of the hearing.17 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.p is for a personal loan Applicant obtained in around 2009. She became 
delinquent for $18,888 in around mid-2014. She intended to use the proceeds from the 
short sale of her home to resolve the account. When the short sale fell through, she 
entered into a payment arrangement with the creditor. As of February 2017, her 
outstanding balance was $9,608. She received an offer of settlement for $3,843. At the

advice of her attorney, she intended to resolve this debt by including it in her 
bankruptcy.18 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.s is for a store account through which Applicant financed several 
appliances. She paid this debt as of February 2017.19 
 
 Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2017, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.t. She 
hired a bankruptcy attorney to do so, who testified at the hearing as discussed below. 
On May 21, 2018, the bankruptcy court confirmed Applicant’s bankruptcy plan. One 
provision of the court order is that Applicant pay the following to the Trustee over the 
course of 60 months: $300 monthly for 9 months, then $453 monthly for 15 months, 
then $1,445 monthly for 36 months. Applicant is also to turn over any future tax refunds, 
and provide a copy of each federal income tax return and any amendment at the time of 
filing.20  
 
 As of the date of the hearing, Applicant’s assets had not substantially changed 
since she filed bankruptcy. Her annual salary was $131,000. She withdrew $58,000 
from her 401(k) in early 2014. She believed her retirement savings were roughly 
$12,000. Applicant paid the outstanding balance on her car in late 2016. Her monthly 
expenses, prior to the May 2018 confirmation of her bankruptcy plan, included her 
$1,934 mortgage, $300 bankruptcy payments, $400 to assist her children with their 
college expenses, $500 water bill, $300 electric bill, $450 to $500 gas bill, and $200 
cable and internet bill. She estimated that her monthly net remainder after these 
expenses was around $200, which she then used for groceries.21  
 
 Applicant also financially assisted her fiancé, who was receiving disability pay 
and was unemployed as of the date of the hearing, though he did not live with her and 
also contributed to her household when possible. She expected to work with her tax 
preparer to formulate a budget. She received financial counseling from both her tax 
preparer and her bankruptcy attorney. She also received financial counseling through a 
credit union as well as through the bankruptcy process.22   
 
Applicant’s first witness was Applicant’s tax preparer. He was an accountant, with 
experience in the banking and mortgage industries. She first consulted with him in 
March 2014 for tax assistance. She needed to rectify her income tax returns for tax 
years 2008 through 2011 that had been prepared by another tax professional and 
resulted in her owing back taxes. She needed to file her outstanding income tax returns

for tax year 2012. And, she needed to file her income tax returns for tax year 2013 that 
were coming due.23  
 
The witness testified that he reviewed Applicant’s 2008 through 2011 income tax 
returns and identified gross errors made by the tax professional who prepared those 
returns, which resulted in Applicant receiving refunds for those tax years when she 
should have owed around $20,000 in federal taxes. She owed zero in state taxes. The 
witness indicated that the tax professional inaccurately accounted for Applicant’s part-
time business, and failed to sign the tax returns, as they were solely signed by 
Applicant.24  
 
Due to her limited finances, Applicant could not afford for the witness to amend 
the returns. Thus, he recommended that she accept the IRS determination that she 
owed $20,000 for those tax years. He then prepared her 2012 and 2013 income tax 
returns, accounted for the losses from her part-time business, and filed them on her 
behalf by the filing deadline for the 2013 tax returns in April 2014. Through his services, 
she was due federal refunds of $2,920 and $9,000, and state refunds of $2,000 and 
$4,067, for tax years 2012 and 2013. These refunds were applied to her 2008 through 
2011 back taxes, thereby reducing her outstanding tax liability. They anticipated a 
similar scenario going forward.25  
 
Due to unrelated personal circumstances, the witness was unable to prepare 
Applicant’s 2014 and 2015 income tax returns by their filing deadline. Applicant thus 
sought the assistance of a third tax professional. She subsequently received an IRS 
notice indicating that she owed $32,000 for tax year 2014. When the witness learned of 
the IRS notice, he obtained a copy of Applicant’s 2014 tax return from the third tax 
professional after significant delay, and noted that this individual also indicated that the 
return was self-prepared. The witness then prepared at least two amendments to the 
2014 return; the initial amendment was rejected by the IRS and the second amendment, 
submitted in January 2018, was pending an IRS response as of the date of the 
hearing.26 
 
The witness noted gross negligence on the part of the third tax professional, who 
reported that Applicant received money from her 401(k) and IRS distributions totaling 
$140,000, but failed to report such money as taxable income. Additionally, the third tax 
professional failed to report Applicant’s business income and expenses for that year. 
The witness expected that Applicant’s outstanding liability of $32,000 for tax year 2014 
would be reduced to between $10,000 and $14,000. As Applicant was laid off during tax

period 2015, the witness noted that the third tax professional had correctly completed 
and filed her tax return for that year.27 
 
The witness prepared and timely filed Applicant’s tax return for tax period 2016. 
Applicant was due a federal refund of $9,639 and a state refund of $2,929, which were 
also applied to her outstanding tax liability. He expected to prepare her tax return for tax 
period 2017 shortly after the date of the hearing, and continue to provide her with 
financial counseling. He testified that when he asked Applicant how she failed to notice 
the negligence by the other two tax professionals, she responded that she relied on 
their professional expertise. Applicant did not owe the witness any money as of the date 
of the hearing.28  
 
The second witness was a bankruptcy attorney Applicant contacted in July 2017, 
for help with resolving her outstanding HOA dues. The witness understood that 
Applicant fell behind on her HOA dues because she was a single parent raising two 
children, and she suffered a loss of employment for a period. The witness indicated that 
the HOA filed a lien against Applicant in 2009, and last filed a lien against her in 2014. 
She assisted Applicant by writing to the HOA and informing them that Applicant wanted 
to make payments towards her outstanding HOA dues. When the HOA began pursuing 
the matter judicially, however, Applicant elected to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy and did 
so in July 2017.29  
 
As of the date of the hearing, the witness testified that Applicant owed $25,000 in 
outstanding HOA dues. The witness indicated that the bankruptcy court granted her 
motion to avoid the HOA liens, as the property against which the liens were placed 
lacked sufficient value to secure them. The HOA liens consequently became unsecured 
debt, and when Applicant’s bankruptcy case is completed, she will no longer have any 
HOA liens against her real property. The witness believed that the remaining liens 
against Applicant’s property included those from the utility companies, the IRS, and 
Applicant’s first mortgage company.30  
 
In response to Applicant’s bankruptcy case, the witness testified that the IRS 
claimed that Applicant owed $32,689 in outstanding federal taxes for tax year 2014. The 
witness noted on the bankruptcy petition that Applicant disputed the amount of the IRS 
claim, because she understood that Applicant was working with the first witness to 
correct that amount. The witness intended to supply to the IRS the latest amendment to 
Applicant’s federal tax returns for tax year 2014, as prepared by the first witness, in 
hopes of resolving the IRS claim informally rather than having to file an objection to it.

The witness also listed the state tax authority in Applicant’s bankruptcy petition out of 
precaution, but was unaware that Applicant had any state tax liability.31  
 
In addition to Applicant’s HOA dues and federal back taxes, the witness listed 
$25,700 in unsecured liability on Applicant’s bankruptcy petition. As the witness 
obtained the information about Applicant’s outstanding unsecured liability from 
Applicant’s credit reports and documentation given to her by Applicant, she listed all of 
Applicant’s outstanding debts as of July 2017. The witness also indicated that Applicant 
owed $345,000 on her mortgage, for which she did not believe Applicant was delinquent 
at the time of the bankruptcy petition, as she understood that Applicant was able to 
obtain a mortgage modification prior to the petition.32 
 
Applicant’s bankruptcy petition reflected a total indebtedness of around 
$420,000. After filing the initial petition, the witness subsequently submitted several 
amendments, the latest of which was in February 2018. The amended 60-month petition 
was pending confirmation before the bankruptcy court as of the date of the hearing, and 
the witness expected to amend the petition at least one more time to reflect the final 
amount of the IRS claim. The witness testified that Applicant had timely paid her 
bankruptcy plan payments of $300 monthly since August 2017. Her payments may 
increase depending on the outcome of the IRS claim and regardless of her annual 
disposable income of $132,470. As part of the bankruptcy case, Applicant is also 
required, and has also timely paid, her mortgage payments of $1,934 monthly. If 
Applicant fails to do so, the mortgage company would file a motion for relief from stay 
with the bankruptcy court. If Applicant were delinquent and a claim were filed by the 
mortgage company, the witness would have to submit an amendment to the bankruptcy 
petition. As of the hearing, she was unaware of any such claim filed by the mortgage 
company. Applicant did not owe the witness any money as of the date of the hearing.33 
  
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
                                                          
31 Tr. at 60-90; GE 8-10.

available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
11 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay her debts, to include her taxes. The evidence is 
sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(f) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Conditions beyond her control contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. For 
the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. When she became delinquent on her mortgage, 
she attempted, though unsuccessfully to short sell her condominium. She also tried to 
get her HOA to repair her roof, which impeded her ability to sell her condominium. She 
succeeded in modifying her mortgage in January 2017, and was current on her 
payments as of the hearing date. 
 
 Applicant intended to use the proceeds from the short sale of her home to 
resolve her delinquent debts, to include her HOA dues. When the short sale fell through, 
 
12 
 
she made some payments on her delinquent debts in part with money she borrowed 
from her 401(k) and through a voluntary garnishment of her wages. She sought the 
assistance of a bankruptcy attorney, who tried to negotiate with her HOA. With the 
attorney’s assistance, Applicant elected to address her delinquent debts by filing 
Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Since doing so and as of the date of the hearing, she was 
current on her plan payments of $300 monthly.  
 
 However, Applicant did not consult with the second tax preparer, to rectify her 
2008 through 2011 tax returns that resulted in her owing back taxes, until March 2014. 
At that point, her income tax returns for tax year 2012 were already outstanding. In 
addition, when she hired a third tax professional to prepare her 2014 and 2015 income 
tax returns, she failed to notice that this individual indicated that these returns had been 
self-prepared. Such diligence on Applicant’s part, having already been informed by the 
second tax preparer that the first tax professional made a similar error, would have likely 
alerted her to seek the assistance of another tax professional, thereby avoiding the 
$32,000 tax debt for that tax year. AG ¶ 20(b) is therefore only partially applicable. 
 
 Applicant received financial counseling and assistance with resolving her 
delinquent debts, to include her back taxes, from the second tax preparer and her 
bankruptcy attorney. While the attorney noted that Applicant has timely paid her 
bankruptcy plan payments of $300 monthly since August 2017, the plan was only 
recently confirmed in May 2018. As such, it is too soon to tell whether Applicant will be 
able to abide the 60-month payment plan as set forth by the court. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 
20(d) do not apply. 
 
 As of November 2016, IRS documentation reflects that Applicant owed a total of 
$24,600 for tax years 2008, 2009 and 2011. She failed to provide documentation to 
corroborate her claim that her outstanding federal taxes for tax year 2008 was resolved 
through the interception of her federal and state tax refunds from tax years 2012, 2013, 
2015, and 2016. She failed to provide documentation to corroborate her claim that she 
only owed around $6,000 in federal taxes for tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Finally, 
she failed to provide documentation concerning the IRS response to her latest 
amendment for tax year 2014. As such, she failed to show that her tax liability of 
$32,000 for that tax year was, in fact, reduced to $10,000. While her bankruptcy was 
confirmed, Applicant failed to show what arrangements, if any, were made to resolve 
her outstanding federal taxes. AG ¶ 20(g) does not apply. 
 
 Applicant’s finances are not under control. There is insufficient evidence to 
conclude that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. They continue to cast doubt 
on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not 
apply.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
 
13 
 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed 
to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c - 1.i, 1.l - 1.o, 1.q - 1.s:  For Applicant 
   
Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.j, 1.k, 1.p, 1.t:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
