LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He owes approximately $170,000 in back taxes to state 
and federal tax authorities for multiple tax years. His history of financial problems also 
includes multiple collection and charged-off accounts. It is far too soon to tell if he will be 
able to make any meaningful progress in addressing his delinquent debts. Accordingly, 
this case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on October 11, 2014.1 This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. Thereafter, on April 5, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was

clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 16, 2016. He admitted the SOR 
allegations except for a single $112 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.j, and he requested a 
hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was initially assigned to me on June 17, 2016, and assigned to me 
again on October 13, 2017. The hearing was scheduled to occur first in September 
2016 and then in March 2018, but did not.2 In due course, the hearing took place on 
May 30, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel offered 
documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-5. Applicant did not offer any 
documentary exhibits and he relied on his own testimony. The hearing transcript (Tr.) 
was received on June 8, 2018. 
 
Procedural Matters 
 
Department Counsel amended the SOR, in writing, on October 16, 2017, by 
adding 13 additional factual allegations under Guideline F. Applicant admitted the 
additional allegations on November 9, 2017. As amended, under Guideline F, the SOR 
contains factual allegations as set forth in ¶¶ 1.a – 1.hhh.  
  
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance 
previously granted to him in 2004. He has been consistently employed throughout his 
adulthood.3 He requires a clearance for part-time work as a consultant in the field of 
software engineering. The consulting work is in addition to his regular full-time 
employment for which he earns about $150,000 annually.4 His first marriage ended in 
divorce in 2012, although he and his then wife separated in 2010 or 2011.5 He currently 
lives with his fiancée. He is the father of six children, ages 18, 17, 15, 14, 2 and 6 
months. The four teenagers are from his first marriage, and the two young children are 
from his current relationship. Per the divorce, he was ordered to pay alimony (spousal 
support) of $1,900 monthly for five years ending in about January 2017; and he was 
ordered to pay child support of $2,400 monthly, although it was recently reduced to 
$1,900 monthly.6

Applicant does not dispute his history of financial problems.7 In his October 2014 
security clearance application, he disclosed back taxes for 2011 and 2012 and a $9,000 
collection account stemming from an automobile repossession.8 The SOR, as 
amended, alleges, and he admits, and the documentary evidence shows the following 
derogatory financial matters: (1) four federal tax liens filed in 2013, 2014, and 2016 for 
$29,064, $20,711, $12,544, and $3,155; (2) six state tax liens filed in 2009, 2010, 2011, 
and 2016 for $11,681, $1,459, $5,645, $5,274, $6,089, and $10,685; (3) five consumer 
accounts for $20,174, and (4) 45 medical collection accounts for various amounts.9  
 
At the hearing, Applicant estimated that he now owes the state tax authority 
$50,000 and the IRS $121,000.10 He stated, without supporting paperwork, that the IRS 
placed his account in currently-not-collectible status, because they concluded that he 
cannot afford to repay the debt, and attempting to repay would create an economic 
hardship on him.11 Likewise, he stated, without supporting paperwork, that the state tax 
authority advised him to address the federal taxes first and then go from there.12 In 
summary, Applicant did not present any documentation to establish that the back taxes, 
the delinquent consumer accounts, or the medical collection accounts were paid, 
settled, in a payment arrangement, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved.  
 
Applicant attributes his financial problems to his 2012 divorce and the resulting 
alimony and child support payments imposed on him.13 He chose to focus on meeting 
those obligations, which he says he has, and that resulted in falling behind on other 
financial obligations. He incurred the back taxes when, following a friend’s advice, he 
elected to claim more exemptions than he was due, which resulted in the under 
withholding of income taxes from his paycheck.14 He stated that his fiancée is a good 
influence on him concerning how he handles financial matters.15 He stated he has no 
investment or retirement accounts.16 Asked whether he had any money in the bank, he 
stated “not really.”17

Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.18 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.19 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”20 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.21 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.22 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.23 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.24 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.25 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.26 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . .29 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive 
information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income 
tax as required;  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity 
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and   
 
                                                          
27 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15. 
 
28 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15.  
 
29 AG ¶ 18. 
 
 
6 
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.   
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. That history is well 
established by his failure to pay tax when due as well as his failure to meet his financial 
obligations as reflected by the delinquent consumer accounts and the numerous 
medical collection accounts. He now owes, by his own estimate, about $170,000 in 
back taxes to state and federal tax authorities.  
 
 Accepting that the federal back taxes are in currently-not-collectible status, it 
simply means the IRS has temporarily closed Applicant’s collection case and he does 
not have to pay the money he owes at this time, but the back taxes were not cancelled 
or forgiven by the IRS. Given these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 
20(g) does not apply in Applicant’s favor because he is not in a payment arrangement 
with either the state or the IRS. In addition, I considered the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 
20(b), but it does not apply in Applicant’s favor. Without doubt, his 2012 divorce and the 
resulting alimony and child support obligations created a demanding financial situation, 
which he says he has met. With that said, I note that some of the state tax liens were 
filed in 2009, 2010, and 2011, which was before the 2012 divorce. His focus on his 
support obligations is laudable, but he did so at the expense of other lawful financial 
obligations, including his income tax obligations. In other words, he did not act 
responsibly under the circumstances.  
 
 The failure to pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of 
serious concern to the federal government.30 The nexus or security significance 
between Applicant’s financial history and his eligibility for access to classified 
information was explained by the Appeal Board as follows: 
 
Security requirements include consideration of a person’s judgment, 
reliability, and a sense of [their] legal obligations. Failure to comply with 
federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem 
with abiding by well-established government rules and regulations. 
Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting 
classified information.31  
 
That is the situation here. Applicant did not voluntarily comply with his lawful obligation 
to pay his income taxes when due. Indeed, he essentially did so on purpose, by 
claiming an excessive number of exemptions and under withholding of income taxes 
from his paycheck. This is a serious concern because his failure to comply with federal 
                                                          
30 The General Accountability Office (GAO) expressed serious concern over the relationship between tax 
delinquents and clearance holders in its July 28, 2014 report, Security Clearances: Tax Debts Owed by 
DOD Employees and Contractors, http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665052.pdf.

and state tax law may easily carry over into lapses in the serious business of properly 
handling and safeguarding classified information.  
 
 To sum up, it is far too soon to tell if Applicant will be able to make any 
meaningful progress in addressing his delinquent debts, which includes a mountain of 
back taxes. His history of tax problems reflects a pattern of irresponsibility, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. In reaching this 
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence 
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person 
concept. Nevertheless, I conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information.
