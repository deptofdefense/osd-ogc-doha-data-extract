MASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Before April 2002 and March 2015, Applicant was unemployed 19 times for 
periods between one and six months. Since March 2015, he has worked for one 
employer. In August 2017, he mailed proposed payment agreements to 37 creditors or 
collection agencies. He established a repayment plan with the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) to begin repaying two federal tax liens in October 2017. A second payment plan 
with the IRS was established on November 2, 2017, to include additional unlisted tax 
years. Applicant furnished no documentation showing payments made under either IRS 
plan or payments under the agreements he established with the other listed creditors. 
The financial considerations guideline is unmitigated. Eligibility for security clearance 
access is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On September 22, 2015, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (Item 3) to retain a security clearance required for a 
position with a defense contractor. He provided summary interviews (PSIs) (Item 6) to 
 
  2 
 
an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on December 1, 2016; 
December 15, 2016, and January 30, 2017. On July 14, 2017, DOD issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security reasons under the financial 
considerations guideline (Guideline F).   The action was taken under Executive Order 
(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive 
Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a 
Sensitive Position (AGs). The AGs became applicable on June 8, 2017, to all individuals 
who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility 
to hold a sensitive position.  
 
Applicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on August 15, 2017. He 
elected to have his case decided on a written record instead of a hearing. The 
Government sent Applicant a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), the 
Government’s evidence in support of the allegations in the SOR, to Applicant on 
October 19, 2017. Applicant received the FORM on November 7, 2017. The 
Government advised Applicant that he could either file objections, furnish explanations, 
submit additional material, or take advantage of all three options within 30 days of 
receiving the FORM. Applicant’s response was due on October 14, 2017. The Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received a two-page response from Applicant 
on November 13, 2017; this exhibit was admitted into evidence.  DOHA assigned the 
case file to me on March 16, 2018. 
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
 In a footnote on the first page of the FORM, Department Counsel advised 
Applicant that the PSIs would be excluded from evidence if he objected to them. 
Alternatively, Department counsel advised him that he could correct, update, or modify 
the exhibit to improve the exhibits’ its clarity or accuracy. Applicant did not object, and 
the PSIs are admitted into evidence. See, E3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5220.6, page 52.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges a federal tax lien for 2010, a federal tax lien for 2011, and 38 
delinquent debts. The debts became delinquent between April 2009 and April 2016. 
Applicant answered affirmatively to all allegations. Attached to his answer is a one-page 
statement explaining that the delinquencies were caused by periodic unemployment 
and the lack of financial counseling. He contacted all creditors and established payment 
plans. He was confident that these remedial steps would improve his financial 
responsibility to an acceptable level.  
 
 Applicant is 51 years old and lives with his girlfriend. He has been divorced twice. 
He has a 26-year-old son. He received technical training at a military school between 
 
  3 
 
January and June 1982. He collected additional college credits between August 1982 
and April 1985, between March 2013 and May 2014, and between June 2014 and 
August 2014, but did not attain a degree. Applicant is an avionics technician. He served 
in the United States Air Force from 1981 to 1985, and was discharged under general 
conditions. Between April 2002 and March 2015, Applicant was laid off or unemployed 
19 times, with layoff periods lasting from one month to six months. He has held a 
security clearance since September 1982.  
 
 In response to the two federal tax liens (SOR 1.a, 1.b), in August 11, 2017, 
Applicant signed an installment agreement request (Form 9465) to repay the IRS in 
payments of $535 a month until the balance of $38,269 was paid in full.1 Payments 
were to be made by automatic deduction from his bank account. No documentation was 
provided showing that payments were made. In  his November 9, 2017 response to the 
FORM, he provided a two-page letter from the IRS dated November 2, 2017, increasing 
the tax years with unpaid tax balances from 2010 and 2011, to 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 
2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016. Applicant was instructed to 
begin paying the IRS $100 a month on December 20, 2017, and continue the monthly 
payments until the unpaid balance was paid or his financial situation changed. Since the 
November 2, 2017 letter from the IRS does not include tax years 2010 and 2011, he 
must have been or still is in two payment plans with the IRS. In the middle of August 
2017, Applicant sent the remaining listed creditors proposed payment plans to begin in 
September or October 2017. For September 2017, Applicant promised partial payments 
of $1,360 to the remaining creditors. Regarding the smaller debts below $100, he 
promised to pay off the entire amounts of SOR 1.mm ($64) and SOR 1.nn ($51) in 
September 2017. The record contains no proof that payments were made to any 
creditors. Applicant was advised by letter dated August 14, 2017, that the SOR 1.z 
collection agency had stopped collection activity and returned the account to the SOR 
1.i creditor. SOR 1.z is withdrawn.  
 
 At the time of his December 1, 2016 PSI, Applicant was working and living at a 
location in the United States not listed in his September 2015 e-QIP. He explained that 
as an avionics technician, he worked on employment contracts on an as-needed basis. 
When the contract was completed, he was laid off. While working for his current 
employer, he worked at one location from September to November 2015; he worked at 
another location in December 2015, and another location in January 2016.  
 
 In his December 15, 2016 PSI, Applicant stated that he incurred delinquent 
federal taxes in 2010 and 2011 (SOR 1.a, 1.b) for not taking out sufficient withholdings 
from his income. In December 2016, Applicant’s total unpaid federal taxes for the two 
years were about $37,300. He stated that he fell below the poverty level between 2010 
and 2013, and was placed on a non-collection status by the IRS. Applicant recalled 
paying $800 a month for a period in 2015 to resolve the federal tax debt. He stopped 
                                            
1 The figure represents the total amount of the two liens plus interest. See attachment to 
Applicant’s answer explaining lien amounts and corresponding interest.

the payments, but provided no explanation. He planned to include the delinquent federal 
taxes in his bankruptcy.   
 
 Attached to his August 17, 2017 answer to the SOR is documented proof that 
Applicant received online credit counseling from a certified credit counseling agency. He 
stated that the counseling helped him “implement better payment, budgeting and saving 
methods and how to stay in contact with all creditors keeping them informed of any and 
all financial changes that might occur.” However, he did not specify how the counseling 
helped him improve his financial practices. The only documented contact with the 
creditors occurred in August 2017 when he offered the terms of his repayment 
agreements.  
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which 
are flexible rules of law, are applied together with common sense and the general 
factors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the 
paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(d) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel 
being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by 
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial 
distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, 
other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health 
conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known 
sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal 
activity, including espionage. 
 
  5 
 
 
Applicant incurred 37 delinquent debts between April 2009 and April 2016. He 
owes over $28,000 in delinquent federal taxes for two federal tax liens that were filed in 
2010 and 2011. The delinquent debts and federal tax liens support the application of the 
following disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
AG ¶ 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 Applicant developed a seven-year history of not meeting financial obligations. 
The debts and federal tax liens are still delinquent. His financial difficulties, which are 
likely to continue in the future, continue to cast doubt on his trustworthiness and 
judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 
  6 
 
 Unemployment is recognized as a condition that results in financial problems 
beyond the person’s control. Between 2002 and March 2015, Applicant’s September 
2015 e-QIP shows that he was unemployed 19 times for periods of one month to six 
months. The 2015 e-QIP also reflects that he was aware of at least the two federal tax 
liens and 11 delinquent debts. He confirmed all the listed delinquent debts in his 
December 2016 PSIs. But he did not submit documented action to address the liens 
and debts until almost two years later in August 2017. He receives some mitigation 
under the first prong of AG ¶ 20(b) because of his periodic unemployment between 
2002 and March 2015, but no mitigation under the second prong of the condition for not 
acting reasonably and responsibly to focus on his indebtedness in 2015 or 2016.   
 
 Though there is documented evidence showing that Applicant received online 
credit counseling, there is no evidence to support a conclusion that his debts are under 
control. Establishing payment plans without a track record of regular and sustained 
payments to the listed creditors or collection agencies does not qualify as a good-faith 
effort to satisfy debts. AG ¶¶ 20(c) and 20(d) are inapplicable. I reach the same 
conclusion under AG ¶ 20(g) as Applicant furnished no evidence of confirmed payments 
under his repayment plan with the IRS to resolve SOR 1.a and 1.b.   
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
I have examined the evidence under the financial considerations guideline in the 
context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for 
access to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
 Applicant, 51 years old, lives with his girlfriend. He has a 26-year-old son. He 
served in the U.S. Air Force from 1981 to 1985. He has held a security clearance since 
1982. He received technical training at a military school in 1982. He earned college 
credits from 1982 to 1985, from March 2013 to May 2014, and from June to August 
2014.  
 
 Between April 2009 and April 2016, Applicant accumulated a significant amount 
of debt to the IRS and to commercial creditors. Though he contacted the IRS and the 
 
  7 
 
listed creditors and set up payment plans, he provided no documentation showing that 
he made the promised partial payments, even for the listed debts under $100. Having 
weighed and balanced all the evidence under the specific conditions in light of the 
record as a whole, Applicant has not mitigated the lingering security concerns arising 
from the financial considerations guideline.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.y, 1.aa-1.nn:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.z:      Withdrawn  
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to 
classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
