HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant resolved all of the delinquent debts listed on his statement of reasons 
(SOR). Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is granted.            
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On January 18, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On July 21, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under 
Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, Appendix A, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining 
Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position 
(AGs), June 8, 2017. The SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2).  
 
On August 18, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested 
a hearing. (HE 3) On November 27, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. 
On December 4, 2017, the case was assigned to me. On March 1, 2018, the Defense 
 
2 
                                         
 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for March 14, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, 
time, and location of his hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 5-6) Applicant’s hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant did not 
offer any exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 19-20, 23; GE 1-4) On March 23, 2018, DOHA received the hearing 
transcript. Applicant provided five exhibits after his hearing, which were admitted without 
objection. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE E) The record closed on June 18, 2018. (Tr. 44) 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.b, and he 
denied the other SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating 
information. (HE 3)   
 
Applicant is 54 years old, and he has been employed in simulations on a military 
installation for the previous eight years. (Tr. 7, 9; GE 1) In 1981, Applicant graduated from 
high school. (Tr. 7) He attended college for three years; however, he did not receive a 
bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 7-8, 18) He served in the U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard 
as a field artillery officer for 28 years, and he honorably retired as a major. (Tr. 8) He has 
five years of active duty service. (Tr. 8) In 1985, Applicant married, and in 1987, he 
divorced. (Tr. 9) In 1989, he married, and his children are ages 21 and 25. (Tr. 10)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Appellant’s current annual salary is about $75,000, and his spouse’s annual salary 
is about $52,000. (Tr. 24-25) He and his spouse have about $1,000 available each month 
to address their debts. (Tr. 25) He and his spouse use a budget, and all of their debts are 
current. (Tr. 26) He provided his budgets for the previous three years. (AE B-AE D) 
Applicant was unemployed from November 2009 to April 2010. (Tr. 18, 27, 36) In 2010, 
he received credit counseling. (Tr. 41-42) 
 
The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $102,956 and a mortgage 
foreclosure, and the record establishes the status of Applicant’s accounts as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $95,363. In 2003, Applicant moved; he 
rented out his home in one city; and he purchased a home in another city. (Tr. 29-30) A 
tenant destroyed his residential property. (Tr. 30) After the tenant destroyed the property, 
it was vacant. (Tr. 31) It received additional damage in a flood. (Tr. 32) Applicant sold the 
house for $1,200, and the purchaser paid the taxes. (Tr. 32-33) Applicant believed his  
mortgage debt was resolved. (Tr. 33) He was surprised to learn the property went through 
foreclosure, and there was a deficiency. (Tr. 33) The creditor was seeking $60,000 from 
                                            
1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits.

Applicant. (Tr. 33) On June 8, 2018, the creditor wrote Applicant and advised him that on 
May 22, 2018, the creditor received “full payment for the account” in the amount of 
$33,374, and “[t]here is no remaining balance on the account.” (AE A) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges one of Applicant’s mortgages was foreclosed in about 2011. 
The debt related to a different rental property than the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. (Tr. 34-
35) Applicant said there was no deficiency after the foreclosure. (Tr. 35, 37) There is no 
evidence of a deficiency or balance owed to the creditor. (GE 3; GE 4) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g allege three delinquent medical debts for $2,037, $509, 
and $356. On May 15, 2017, Applicant paid the medical debt for $2,037. (SOR response 
at 77) On August 10, 2017, he paid the medical debts for $509 and $356. (SOR response 
at 78)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $695. 
Applicant paid the debt, and the negative information about the delinquent debt was 
removed from his credit report. (Tr. 38-39) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a charged-off bank debt for $411. Applicant said he contacted 
the creditor, and the creditor informed him that the debt was paid in 2011. (Tr. 39-40; 
SOR response at 78A) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a charged-off debt for $2,785. (Tr. 40) On May 12, 2012, 
Applicant paid $1,212 and settled this debt. (SOR response at 79)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a department store debt placed for collection for $830. On 
September 9, 2010, the creditor wrote that Applicant owed $698. (SOR response at 80) 
Applicant believes he paid this debt. (Tr. 39-40) The debt does not appear on his March 
24, 2017 credit report. (GE 3) 
 
Applicant’s May 27, 2018 credit reports indicate his scores for Experian, 
TransUnion, and Equifax, are 736, 717, and 735. (AE E)2 His senior rater in his final 
officer evaluation report indicated, “Incredible performance. [Applicant] is the best Major 
that I senior rate in this command and is among the top 10% of Majors with whom I’ve 
served.” (SOR response at 83) His performance evaluation from the government 
contractor lauds his dedication and diligence. (SOR response at 84-85)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
                                            
2 Credit ratings from 700 to 749 are considered “good.” See Experian website,

access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
   
  
 
6 
                                         
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).

The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $102,956 and a mortgage 
foreclosure. Applicant left the Army, transferred to a different city, and was unemployed 
for several months. A tenant and a flood destroyed one of his rental properties. These are 
circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances.  
 
The foreclosure alleged in the SOR did not result in a deficiency. Applicant paid or 
settled all of the debts alleged in the SOR, and he does not have any delinquent debts. 
He has a good credit score. He received financial counseling, and he uses a budget. 
Future financial problems are unlikely to occur. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are 
established, and financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 54 years old, and he has been employed in simulations on a military 
installation for the previous eight years. He attended college for three years. He served 
in the U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard as a field artillery officer for 28 years, and 
he honorably retired as a major. He provided an excellent officer evaluation report and 
contractor employee evaluation.   
 
Applicant paid or settled all of the debts alleged in the SOR, and he does not have 
any delinquent debts. He received financial counseling, and he uses a budget. His actions 
show financial responsibility and judgment and favorably resolve questions about 
Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG 
¶ 18. Future financial problems are unlikely to occur.   
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
 
8 
                                         
 
that financial consideration concerns are mitigated, and it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s security clearance eligibility. Financial 
considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:  For Applicant 
     
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
