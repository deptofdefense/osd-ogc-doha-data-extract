Decision 
______________ 
 
 
NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DOD) intent to deny his continued 
eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct 
concerns raised by his solicitation of prostitutes in South Korea and Thailand between 
1999 and 2013. He also failed to mitigate the foreign influence concerns raised by his 
ongoing contact with a Thai national, a former prostitute, with whom Applicant considers 
himself romantically involved. Continued access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On June 28, 2017, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under the personal conduct and foreign influence guidelines.1 DOD 
adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant Applicant’s security clearance and recommended his case be submitted to an 
administrative judge for consideration. 
                                                          
1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information, implemented on June 8, 2017.
