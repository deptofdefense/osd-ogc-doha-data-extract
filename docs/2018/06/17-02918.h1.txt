Decision 
______________ 
 
 
KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his 
problematic financial history. He did, however, mitigate the security concern raised by his 
personal conduct. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on June 9, 2016. This document is commonly known as a security 
clearance application. On October 27, 2017, after reviewing the application and the 
information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), 
explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the factual reasons for 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.

the action under the security guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations 
and Guideline E for personal conduct. Applicant answered the SOR on November 20, 
2017, and requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.   
 
On March 12, 2018, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on March 13, 2018. He was given thirty 
days to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the 
Government’s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on April 2, 2018. Applicant  
responded to the FORM on April 15, 2018. The case was assigned to me on June 4, 
2018.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Applicant’s response to the FORM included a nine-page document that I have 
marked as Applicant’s Exhibit (AE) A, which is admitted into evidence without objection. 
Included in the FORM were 13 items of evidence, items 6 through 13 of which are marked 
as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 and are admitted into evidence without 
objection.3 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 50 years old and a high school graduate. He is divorced but is currently 
engaged to his cohabitant. He has three sons, ages 23, 18, and 14, the two younger of 
whom live with Applicant’s former spouse. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. 
Army from October 1992 until July 2001 and in the active reserve from July 2001 until 
September 2005. He was in the inactive reserve until August 2007. He was honorably 
discharged. Since August 2011, he has been self-employed as a defense contractor.4 
 
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has four delinquent debts 
totaling over $21,000 and that he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2011, which 
was dismissed in January 2012.5 Applicant admitted the debts. He qualifiedly admitted 
the bankruptcy filing and stated that he signed the bankruptcy filing form for a realtor who 
was helping him stop the mortgage company from foreclosing on Applicant’s house. 
Applicant said that he was notified only after the fact that the form had been filed, and 
when he learned of it he caused the bankruptcy to be dismissed.6 Applicant attributed his 
                                                          
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documents, 
which documents are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 Items 1 and 4 are the SOR and Applicant’s Answer, respectively. Those are the pleadings in this case 
and, therefore, they are not marked as exhibits. Items 2, 3, and 5, are the SOR transmittal letter, Applicant’s 
receipt, and his email request to convert this case to a FORM, respectively. Those documents have no 
evidentiary value and, therefore, are not marked as exhibits.

financial troubles to his 2011 divorce, his loss of employment in 2011, and his inability to 
find employment at a compensation level comparable to what he was making in 2011.7 
The SOR debts remain currently delinquent.8 
 
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant was fired by his employer in 
2011 for improperly accessing confidential company documents and providing those 
documents to a direct competitor. The SOR also alleged that Applicant intentionally made 
false statements (in his background interview and in his SF 86) about why he was fired 
and how the bankruptcy came to be filed.9 Applicant denied those allegations. He 
reiterated his disclosures in his security clearance application that he had been “fired 
under duress and after considerable personality conflicts” with the owner and that the 
bankruptcy was filed without his knowledge and that he had the case dismissed once he 
learned of it. He also reiterated his disclosure in his security clearance application that 
the document in question was a writing sample he prepared on his own computer and 
contained no confidential company information. In short, Applicant claimed that his firing 
was in bad faith.10  
 
Law and Policies 
 
 It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.11 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”12 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.  
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.13 An

unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.14 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.15 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.16 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.17 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.18 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.19 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.20 
 
     Discussion 
  
Guideline F -  Financial Considerations  
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,21 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information.22 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important

qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions or factors: 
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
AG ¶ 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
 AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to a SOR require no further proof by 
the Government.23 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a 
problematic financial history, as alleged. This raises security concerns under AG ¶¶ 19(a), 
(b), and (c).  The next inquiry is whether any potentially mitigating conditions apply. 
 
Although the SOR debts went delinquent in the 2009 to 2011 time frame, they 
remain currently delinquent. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to his divorce, his 2011 loss of 
employment, and his inability to find employment at a salary level comparable to his 2011 
level. Those are conditions largely beyond Applicant’s control as contemplated by AG ¶ 
20(b). The next inquiry, however, is whether Applicant acted responsibly under those 
circumstances.

allegations . . . relieve Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 
(App. Bd. Mar. 30, 1995) (“[a]n applicant’s admissions, whether testimonial or written, can provide a legal 
basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”).

  Applicant has not submitted any documents establishing that he has paid or 
otherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. The Appeal Board has previously noted that it 
is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the 
satisfaction of individual debts.24 On this record, I find that none of the mitigating 
conditions apply.25  
 
Guideline E - Personal Conduct  
 
 In assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the 
allegation and applicant’s answer but all relevant circumstances.26 Under Guideline E for 
personal conduct, the concern is that “[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of 
candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified 
or sensitive information.”27 A statement is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately 
(knowingly and willfully). 
 
 In this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified the facts about his firing and 
his filing of bankruptcy in his security clearance application and during his background 
interview. From the very outset, however, starting with his security clearance application 
in June of 2016, in his background interview in February 2017, in his November 2017 
answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM, Applicant has consistently and in 
detail explained that he believes his firing was in bad faith, the stated causes contrived, 
and that the bankruptcy was filed without his consent. Applicant’s explanation is plausible, 
which shifts the burden to the Government.  As such, the Government has not carried its 
burden of proof. I find in favor of Applicant on the Guideline E allegations.   
 
  The evidence on Applicant’s financial condition raises doubts about his reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable 
evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due 
consideration to the whole-person concept.28 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has 
not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.

Bd. Sep. 20, 2007). 
 
25 I find that Applicant’s explanation of his bankruptcy filing to be credible. It was a responsible precautionary 
measure to protect his house, was unwittingly filed, and was dismissed shortly after filing.

Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d:                   Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.e:       For Applicant  
 
  Paragraph 2, Guideline E:       For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 2.a-2.e:                   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
