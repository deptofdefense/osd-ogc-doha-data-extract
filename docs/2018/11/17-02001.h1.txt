GOLDSTEIN, Jennifer, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, 
Financial Considerations. His failure to timely file tax returns and failure to pay federal 
income tax obligations in a timely manner, remain a concern. National security eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On July 28, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under 
Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.

Applicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 18, 2017, and 
requested a decision based on the administrative record. On September 12, 2017, 
Department Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was 
assigned to another administrative judge on March 15, 2018. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on April 16, 2018, scheduling 
the hearing for May 22, 2018. On May 21, 2018, the hearing was cancelled, pursuant to 
a continuance request by Applicant’s counsel. On May 29, 2018, a new notice of hearing 
was issued, scheduling the hearing for June 28, 2018. The case was reassigned to me 
on June 12, 2018. Applicant filed a supplemental response to the SOR on June 18, 2018. 
I convened the hearing as rescheduled on June 28, 2018. The Government offered 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant 
testified on his own behalf, called one witness, and presented Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 
through 12, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the 
hearing (Tr.) on July 9, 2018. On October 25, 2018, Applicant’s counsel submitted a letter 
withdrawing from representation of Applicant in this matter, which I marked Hearing 
Exhibit I. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. 
The SOR alleged Applicant had a state tax lien in the amount of $7,095; two Federal tax 
liens in the amounts of $85,485 and $9,739; that he failed to file both Federal and state 
income tax returns for tax years 2009 through 2012; and that he filed Chapter 7 
bankruptcy in 2014. After a thorough and careful review of the testimony, pleadings, and 
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: 
 
 Applicant has worked for his employer for approximately 16 months. He is married 
and has four adult children, three of which reside with him. He has held a security 
clearance for ten years. (Tr. 30-31.)  
 
Applicant experienced financial problems from 2008 through at least 2012, while 
he was self-employed. He owned two consulting firms, which subcontracted to defense 
industry contractors. His businesses did well initially, but slowly business decreased due 
to cuts in defense spending. He experienced additional financial problems when 
contractors issued late payments. Eventually he had to close the businesses. While trying 
to grow the businesses, he failed to “take any taxes out for [him]self” when he did payroll 
deductions. As a result in 2007, he had a $18,000 Federal tax liability. He continued to 
incur Federal and state tax liabilities while operating his businesses. In 2013, Applicant 
found another job, but at a substantially lower salary. In April 2013, two Federal tax liens 
were filed against him for $9,739 and $85,485. In April 2015, his state filed a tax lien 
against him in the amount of $7,095. (GE 4; AE 8; Tr. 33-35, 51, 57-58, 60.)  
 
Applicant admitted that he failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for 
tax years 2009 through 2012. He indicated that he was focused on driving his business 
and did not have a good answer for his failure to file his Federal and state income tax 
returns. In 2010, he hired a company (Company 1) to assist him with filing his delinquent 
 
3 
 
 
2008 and 2009 Federal and state income tax returns. He paid Company 1 $5,550, and 
completed intake forms. He followed up with emails and phone calls, but Company 1 was 
not responsive. Company 1 failed to take any actions to resolve his outstanding tax 
returns or delinquencies. (Tr. 31-32, 39-40, 62, 74; AE 1; AE 4.) 
 
In 2012, Applicant hired Company 2 to establish a payment plan to resolve his 
Federal tax delinquency. Company 2 tried to establish an installment agreement for 
monthly payments of $500 to be made to the IRS. (AE 4; AE 5; Tr. 63-64.) It is unclear 
from the record what happened to that agreement. (AE 12.)  
 
In 2013, he hired another tax firm (Company 3) to file his outstanding tax returns. 
Company 3 has helped him negotiate with his state to repay his delinquent tax obligation. 
He documented that on February 1, 2018, he made two $1,000 payments to his state 
comptroller and promised to make payments of $400 monthly to resolve his state tax debt. 
He currently owes over $100,000 to his state in back income taxes. (AE 3; AE 4; AE 5; 
AE 12; Tr. 69.) 
 
Applicant’s wages were garnished by the Federal government for approximately 
one month in June to July of 2014. During that month, Applicant claimed $9,000 was 
garnished toward his Federal tax delinquency. He was able to stop the garnishment by 
setting up a temporary payment agreement with the IRS. He agreed to remit $1,000 per 
month to resolve his delinquency. (GE 4.) It is unclear from the record if Applicant made 
any payments under that agreement. (GE 2; GE 4; AE 12.) 
 
Company 3 was acquired by Company 4. Company 4 is currently representing 
Applicant in negotiations with the IRS to resolve his outstanding debt. Since 2015, 
Applicant and his wife reflect they have been awaiting assignment of an IRS revenue 
officer. (AE 5; Tr. 37-43, 65-68-69, 88.) Company 4 provided a letter indicating that as of 
June 11, 2018, Applicant’s case is “awaiting assignment to a local agent” in his state. (AE 
6.) He owes the IRS in excess of $400,000. He is not currently making payments on this 
debt. (AE 12; Tr. 74-76.) 
 
Applicant’s IRS tax transcripts indicate that his 2009 Federal income tax returns 
were filed in December 2011. He owes $61,147 to the IRS for 2009. His 2010 Federal 
income tax returns were filed in September 2015. He owes the IRS $83,736 for the 2010 
tax year. His 2011 Federal income tax return was filed in October 2015, and he owes 
$136,502 for that year. His 2012 Federal income tax return was filed in October 2015, 
and he owes $92,376 for 2012. He also owes $26,639 for the 2013 tax year, although 
that return was filed in a timely manner. He owed nothing for the 2014 or 2015 tax years. 
(AE 12.) 
 
In 2014, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He completed a debt education 
course concerning personal financial management as part of the bankruptcy 
requirements. He attributed his bankruptcy to his unemployment and underemployment. 
His summary of schedules reflected that he had $21,605 in unsecure assets and total 
 
4 
 
 
liabilities of $509,082, which included his home mortgage. He discharged the unsecured 
debt through bankruptcy. (AE 2; AE 11; Tr. 36.) 
 
When Applicant began experiencing financial problems, he “pull[ed his] kids out of 
college” to reduce costs. (Tr. 54.) His wife now earns a monthly income of $3,265. He has 
doubled his income and now earns enough to make payments on his tax obligations. (AE 
9; AE 10; Tr. 36, 48.) He is current on his car payments. (Tr. 43.) Since 2014, he has not 
incurred any substantial new debt. His budget reflects he has a monthly surplus of $4,806, 
after expenses are paid. (AE 7; AE. 10; Tr. 48-49.) Since 2013, he has filed his Federal 
and state income tax returns in a timely manner and paid the amounts owed. (Tr. 52.)  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s national security eligibility, the administrative judge 
must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, 
the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used 
in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in AG ¶ 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I have 
drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence 
contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere 
speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive ¶ E3.1.15 states an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.”  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. 
 
5 
 
 
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, 
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. 
 
Finally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out 
in AG & 18:  
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
AG ¶ 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are 
potentially applicable:  
 
 (a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
 (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations. He failed to timely 
file Federal and state income tax returns from 2009 through 2012, and pay his Federal 
and state income tax obligations from 2009 to present, which resulted in three tax liens 
that were filed against him. He also discharged debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy. There 
 
6 
 
 
is sufficient evidence to raise substantial security concerns under the above disqualifying 
conditions. 
 
The guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising 
from Applicant’s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 
are potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
In Financial cases, the Appeal Board has held: 
 
Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem 
with complying with well-established government rules and regulations. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and regulations is essential for 
protecting classified information. (ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. 
April 15, 2016); ISCR Case No. 16-01211 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018.) 
 
 In the instant case, Applicant experienced financial problems that were partially 
due to events beyond his control, including a downturn in the defense contracting industry 
and late payments by contractors. He also acknowledged that he made mistakes in 
willfully failing to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2009 to 2012. 
The events beyond his control all took place prior to 2013. Since 2013, Applicant has 
documented mere gestures towards addressing his Federal tax liability. His wages were 
garnished in 2014, and he agreed to make payments of $1,000 toward resolution of his 
tax debt. It is unclear if he made any payments under that agreement. What is clear is 
that he is not currently making any payments on his growing Federal tax debt. While he 
 
7 
 
 
has hired several different tax resolution firms, and completed financial counseling related 
to his bankruptcy petition, he has only recently established payment arrangements with 
his state taxation authority and still lacks a plan for the repayment of his Federal tax debt. 
The Appeal Board has found that “Applicants who only begin addressing their security-
significant conduct when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking in judgment 
and reliability.” (ISCR Case No. 16-01211 at 4 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018.) There are no 
clear indications that Applicant has mitigated his past and recent questionable financial 
decisions.  
 
 The timing of his federal income tax filings remains concerning, as does his 
remaining approximately $400,000 in federal tax debt. Applicant has repeatedly failed to 
fulfil this significant legal obligation. Further, while he has begun to resolve his state tax 
debt with documentation of two payments to his state’s comptroller, he failed to 
demonstrate a track record of making the required payments at the close of the record. 
The timing of his actions to resolve his tax obligations and his remaining delinquent debt 
do not establish Applicant has the requisite good judgment needed to possess a security 
clearance. AG ¶ 20(g) has limited application as he has filed all past-due taxes but has 
not repaid his delinquent taxes. However, none of the above mitigating conditions provide 
full mitigation. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct 
and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative 
process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security 
eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
       
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a long history of 
inability or unwillingness to resolve his state and Federal income tax debts. Despite an 
improvement in his financial situation and a current monthly remainder of more than 
$4,000, he has failed make payments on his Federal tax debt. The record evidence leaves 
me with questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security 
 
8 
 
 
clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security 
concerns arising under Guideline F.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.b:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.d:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.e:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.f:    Against Applicant   
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified 
information. National security eligibility is denied.
