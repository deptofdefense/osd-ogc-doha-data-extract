FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 17, 2016. 
On June 11, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline 
F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines 
(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on June 26, 2018, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 26, 2018, 
and the case was assigned to me on September 11, 2018. On September 14, 2018, the 
 
2 
 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for October 11, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, 
presented the testimony of two witnesses, and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A 
through K, which were admitted without objection. I kept the record open until October 
25, 2018, to enable him to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted 
AX L through U, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript 
(Tr.) on October 19, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.i. 
He denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing 
are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old help-desk technician employed by defense contractors 
from June 2011 until May 2018. He received a security clearance in April 2009 and 
worked in public trust positions from August 2013 to August 2017.  
 
In a personal subject interview in September 2017, Applicant told an investigator 
that he worked for about three weeks in August 2017 on a contract and quit because of 
stress-induced health problems. (GX 4 at 6.) At the hearing, he testified that he quit 
because he could not afford the cost of public transportation to and from work. (Tr. 50-
51.) He did not disclose this employment in his SCA.  
 
Applicant was suspended by his most recent employer in April 2018 and then 
terminated for inability to maintain a security clearance. (Tr. 35.) In July 2018, he received 
a job offer for an overseas position paying $62,083 per year, which he has accepted. The 
offer is contingent on his ability to obtain and maintain a security clearance. (AX F; AX J; 
AX K.) 
 
Applicant graduated from high school in June 1990. Between January 1993 and 
May 2011, he attended various universities and community colleges but did not receive 
a degree. He received information-technology (IT) certifications in 2001 and 2011. He has 
student loans totaling about $72,000 that are in forbearance until December 2018. (Tr. 
31-32.) 
 
 Applicant married in November 1998 and divorced in April 2005. He married his 
current spouse in November 2013. He has an 18-year-old daughter from his first 
marriage, for whom he was required to pay child support until recently.  
 
Applicant worked in an IT position for a non-federal employer from June 2000 to 
May 2006, was unemployed from May to November 2006, and worked for a non-federal

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

employer from November 2006 to January 2007. He was unemployed from January to 
May 2007, worked for a non-federal employer for one month, and was unemployed from 
June 2007 to May 2008. He was employed by a federal contractor from May 2008 to April 
2009. From April 2009 to June 2011, he did not have a permanent job, but he was 
intermittently employed on short-term contracts lasting no longer than 90 days. (Tr. 18.) .  
 
 Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in November 2008 after 
accumulating debts due to his unemployment. It was converted to a Chapter 7 
bankruptcy, and he received a discharge in July 2010. (GX 4 at 4-5.) Applicant testified 
that about $20,000 was discharged, and it consisted mostly of medical debts. (Tr. 58.) 
The bankruptcy is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g.  
 
In addition to the bankruptcy discharge, the SOR alleges seven consumer debts 
and a child-support arrearage, which are reflected in credit reports from March 2017 (GX 
3) and April 2018 (GX 2). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: unsecured loan charged off for $25,000. Applicant obtained this loan 
in April 2016 and used it to pay off credit-card debts. (Tr. 41.) Working through a debt-
relief company, he settled the debt for $10,625 in February 2017. (AX M, N, and O.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b: unsecured loan charged off for $17,254. In March 2017, Applicant 
obtained this loan at a lower interest rate than the loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, and used it 
to pay off the loan in SOR ¶ 1.a plus some additional credit-card debt. The debt was 
charged off in April 2017. (GX 2 at 2.) It is not resolved.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c: credit-card debt charged off for $6,122. This credit-card account 
became delinquent in August 2017. Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor, who 
agreed to waive monthly payments for a short time but terminated the waiver when he 
quit his job. The debt is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d: delinquent credit-card debt $820. This credit-card account became 
delinquent in August 2017. Applicant contacted the creditor, who offered a forbearance, 
but he could not accept the offer because it required an initial fee of $50 or $60. (Tr. 53.) 
The debt was charged off in November 2017. (GX 2 at 2.) It is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e: delinquent credit-card debt for $338. Applicant’s last payment on 
this account was in October 2017. He has not contacted the creditor about a payment 
plan or other resolution of the debt. (GX 2 at 2; Tr. 54.) It is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: credit-card debt charged off for $299. This debt was incurred to buy 
a work uniform for the job that he quit after three weeks. (Tr. 54.) It was charged off in 
August 2017 and is not resolved. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: child-support arrearage of $22,764. After Applicant divorced in 2005, 
he was ordered to pay child support of about $544 per month until his daughter reached 
age 18. (GX 4 at 4.) Shortly after receiving the overseas job offer in July 2018, he gave 
 
4 
 
his first wife a promissory note to repay the child-support arrearage. The note provides 
for 40 monthly payments of $750 if he obtains the overseas job and 60 monthly payments 
of $500 if he is unable to accept the overseas job. (AX A.) Applicant has not made any 
payments since executing the promissory note.  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i: time-share debt placed for collection of $953. Applicant and his wife 
purchased this time-share property in 2015 or 2016 but could not afford the maintenance 
fees. He testified that they also had sold another time-share property and were trying to 
sell this one as well. (GX 3 at 19; Tr. 59-60.) The debt is not resolved. 
 
 While Applicant was employed, he was earning about $72,000 per year. (Tr. 35.) 
He currently drives for a ride-sharing company and earns about $350 per week after 
paying for gas and maintenance. (Tr. 34.) His wife is a federal employee and holds a 
public trust position. She earns about $60,000 per year. Her take-home pay is between 
$2,800 and $3,000 per month. (Tr. 79-80.)  
 
Applicant submitted financial statements for the September 2018, reflecting his 
income, his wife’s income, their monthly expenses, and a combined net monthly 
remainder of about $86. (AX Q.) If Applicant is hired for the overseas job, his wife intends 
to accompany him, but she does not know if she will be able to find employment overseas. 
(Tr. 83-84.) 
 
 On October 22, 2018, the day before the record closed, Applicant and his wife 
signed a contract with another debt-relief company. The contract provides for monthly 
payments of $586 by direct debit. The debts included in the debt-relief program include 
those alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.e and 1.i and Applicant’s student loans. (AX U.) Payments 
on the child-support arrearage and to this debt-relief program are not reflected in the 
September 2018 financial statements. Applicant presented no evidence of payments to 
this debt-relief company. 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor from August 2013 to May 2016 regarded his performance 
as a help-desk technician in a military dental clinic as “above and beyond what was 
expected of him.” She considers him trustworthy, of good moral character, and not a 
national security risk. (AX H.) 
 
 Applicant’s supervisor from July 2016 to August 2017 described him as a “high 
performer” known for his ability to quickly assess and resolve technical issues, his work 
ethic, attitude, and technical acumen. Applicant was entrusted with personally identifiable 
information and protected health information, without incident. (AX I.) 
 
 Applicant’s father submitted a statement attesting to Applicant’s honesty, 
determination, and integrity. He states that Applicant was raised to be a person of 
integrity, and that the family motto was “We cannot be bought!” He is confident that 
Applicant will resolve all his delinquent debts within five years if he is granted a security 
clearance. (AX T.)

Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 
(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
 
6 
 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish a 
consistent pattern of excessive credit-card debt and unwise purchases such as timeshare 
vacation properties that they could not afford. The following disqualifying conditions under 
this guideline are established:  
 
AG ¶ 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; 
 
AG ¶ 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(e): consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative 
cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other negative financial 
indicators. 
 
  
 
7 
 
The following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s debts are numerous, recent, and were 
not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is established for the bankruptcy alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g, but not for the 
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f, 1.h, and 1.i. Applicant had several periods of 
unemployment, and his uninsured medical debts incurred during his unemployment were 
discharged in 2010. He was intermittently employed from April 2009 to June 2011, which 
was a condition beyond his control. He testified about a period of unemployment in 2016, 
which is not reflected in his SCA, but it was not beyond his control, because he quit his 
job. He has not acted responsibly. He resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, but he did so by 
incurring the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. He incurred unnecessary debt such as the time-share 
properties. He has been continuously employed since June 2011, but he has made 
minimal progress in resolving his delinquent debts.  
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is not established. Applicant has hired two debt-relief companies to 
assist him, but he has not received the financial counseling contemplated by this 
mitigating condition, and his financial situation is not under control. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, but not for the 
remaining debts. He recently engaged a debt-relief company, but he has not established 
 
8 
 
a track record of payments, and the debt-relief company is not handling all the debs in 
the SOR. He has not made any payments on the child-support arrearage. He is counting 
on the overseas job to resolve his financial problems, but his family income will not 
increase significantly if his wife gives up her $60,000-per-year job to accompany him. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).2  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis 
and applied the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of 
the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by 
his delinquent debts. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 1.a:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.b-1.f:    Against Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.g:     For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.h-1.i:    Against Applicant 
 
  
                                                          
2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.  
 
 
9 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is denied.
