FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on May 4, 2017. On June 22, 
2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent 
him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The 
DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified 
Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as 
amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 
2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on July 30, 2018, and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 15, 2018, and 
the case was assigned to me on August 16, 2018. On August 27, 2018, the Defense 
 
2 
 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled 
for September 26, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 
1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) A through H, which were admitted without objection. I kept the 
record open until October 12, 2018, to enable him to submit additional documentary 
evidence. He timely submitted AX I through O, which were admitted without objection. 
DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 4, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions 
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is a 45-year-old senior principal engineer employed by a defense 
contractor since November 2012. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from July 
1991 to August 2012, when he retired. He worked in the private sector for three months 
after retiring and then was hired by his current employer. He received an associate’s 
degree in May 2007 and a bachelor’s degree in September 2009, while on active duty. 
He has held a security clearance since November 1991. 
 
 Applicant married in November 1991, separated in December 2014, and divorced 
in June 2016. (AX H, Stipulation and Agreement at 1.) Applicant and his wife have four 
children, ages 26, 21, 18, and 15. When they divorced, Applicant’s wife was not employed 
outside the home. She was a student, using Applicant’s GI Bill benefits.  
 
The divorce proceedings were lengthy, contentious, and expensive. Applicant’s 
ex-wife was the plaintiff, and the stated grounds were “unreconcilable differences.” 
Applicant declined to describe the specific basis for it, explaining, “I would like to leave it 
at that. I don’t want to paint a bad image of anybody on this, especially my ex-wife.” (Tr. 
36.) The divorce decree required Applicant to pay spousal support of $1,000 per month 
for three years or until she received her associate’s degree, and thereafter to pay $500 
per month for three years or until she received her bachelor’s degree; and thereafter to 
pay $250 per month for four years. The decree required Applicant to pay child support of 
$1,500 per month for their two minor children. The stipulation and agreement regarding 
property settlement awarded Applicant’s ex-wife 50% of his military retired pay. 
Applicant’s ex-wife agreed to accept the GI Bill living-expense stipend in lieu of the 
spousal support payments. She remarried in October 2016, nullifying the provision for 
spousal support in the separation agreement, but not her entitlement to 50% of his retired 
pay. (Tr. 41; AX H, Stipulation and Agreement at 3.) 
 
 Applicant fell behind on his child-support payments in 2015, after his father passed 
away and Applicant incurred some of his father’s burial expenses as well as travel 
expenses to attend the funeral. He and his nine siblings shared the burial expenses, and 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.

each paid about $1,000. His travel expense to and from the funeral was about $1,200. 
(Tr. 44.) His pay was garnished to collect the child-support arrearage. The payments are 
now current. (Tr. 22; AX D; AX E.)  
 
 Applicant also fell behind on the monthly payments of $1,975 on the mortgage loan 
for the marital residence. The June 2017 credit report reflected that his payments were 
60 days past due for $3,935. (GX 2 at 3.) The May 2018 credit report reflected that his 
payments were past due for $5,825. (GX 3 at 1.) Applicant testified that he contacted the 
lender, who was unwilling to accept partial payments but agreed to set up an escrow 
account for partial payments, in which Applicant could accumulate sufficient funds to 
constitute a full payment. He testified that he had about $900 in the escrow account. He 
is making his regular payments, plus an additional $80 per month for the escrow account. 
(Tr. 36-37.) He testified that the lender agreed to not foreclose unless he was more than 
90 days delinquent. He provided documentary evidence of payments of $1,975 by 
automatic withdrawal in May, June, and July 2018. (AX N.) The past-due loan payments 
are not alleged in the SOR. 
 
 Applicant testified that he intends to sell or rent out his home to reduce his living 
expenses. (Tr. 39.) The May 2018 credit report reflects that his balance on the loan is 
$319,502. (GX 3 at 1.) The market value of his home is about $361,400. (AX O.) 
 
 Applicant also fell behind on his car payments. He contacted the lender, who has 
agreed to not repossess the car as long as his payments are not more than 60 days past 
due. (Tr. 45-45.) The delinquent car payments are not alleged in the SOR. 
 
 Applicant borrowed $3,600 from his 401(k) account to pay several credit-card 
debts. The loan is being repaid by payroll deductions of $55 per two-week pay period. 
(AX A; Tr.47.) 
 
 The evidence concerning the seven delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is 
summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶¶1.a and 1.b: judgments filed in December 2016 and October 2017 for 
unpaid rent ($1,279 and $2,252). These judgments were satisfied by garnishment of 
Applicant’s pay. (AX F) The credit reports in the record do not reflect any delinquent debts 
to this creditor or any unsatisfied judgments. (GX 2; GX 3.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c: pending lawsuit for legal fees. Applicant incurred substantial legal 
fees in connection with his divorce. Contrary to the allegation of a “pending lawsuit,” there 
are no documents in the record reflecting a pending lawsuit or any judgments. An invoice 
from the law firm reflects payments of $3,500 in January 2015; $2,500 in December 2015; 
$6,100 in January 2016; $300 in April 2016; $1,000 in April 2016; and $100 in October 
2017; with a balance due of $10,120. (AX L.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d: unsecured loan charged off for $17,196. Applicant obtained this loan 
to defray the expenses of maintaining two homes beginning in December 2014, when he 
 
4 
 
and his wife separated. (Tr. 25, 34.) He incurred expenses of about $2,000 per month to 
maintain a separate residence while his then wife resided in the marital home. (Tr. 35.) 
He now resides in the marital home. He testified that he contacted the creditor for 
unsecured loan, but was unable to make payment arrangements. He has made no 
payments on this debt. (Tr. 25-26.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e: credit-card debt charged off for $13,977. This account was opened 
in June 2012 and charged off for $13,977 in October 2016. Pursuant to a payment 
agreement, Applicant made a $135 payment in June 2017 and monthly $100 payments 
from July 2017 through September 2018. (AX B; AX K.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: credit-card debt charged off for $2,600. This account was opened in 
April 1998 and charged off in November 2016. Pursuant to a payment agreement, 
Applicant made two $200 payments in June 2017 and monthly $200 payments from July 
2017 through September 2018. (AX B; AX J.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g: credit-card debt charged off for $1,208. Applicant has not yet taken 
any action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 55.) 
 
 Applicant’s net pay per two-week pay period is $3,970. Deductions from his gross 
pay include child support. (AX A.) One of his children just turned 18, and he intends to 
ask the court to reduce his child-support payments, but he had not done so as of the date 
the record closed. (Tr.29.) He maintains a spread sheet showing all his monthly 
obligations and expenses, including the debt payments and unresolved debts discussed 
above. He estimates that his net monthly income, which includes his salary, his share of 
his military retirement, and disability pay, is about $6,600. His net monthly remainder after 
debt payments and living expenses is about $495. (AX C.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information 
about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 
5 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant 
has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have 
established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 
(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
 
6 
 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR 
Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s admissions and the evidence submitted during and after the hearing 
establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy 
debts”) and AG ¶ 19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). The following 
mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s delinquent debts are numerous and 
recent. Because he declined to provide any details about the circumstances of his 
separation and divorce, there is no evidence showing that the financial problems 
attributable to his divorce were incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to 
recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is established. The death of Applicant’s father and his financially 
devastating marital break-up were conditions beyond his control. He has acted 
responsibly by maintaining contact with his creditors, including those not alleged in the 
SOR, negotiating payment agreements when possible, and formulating a comprehensive 
overall plan for resolving his debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established. Applicant is making payments on his mortgage loan and 
his car loan, which are not alleged in the SOR. The two judgments for unpaid rent were 
satisfied by garnishment. Payment of a debt through garnishment rather than a voluntary 
effort diminishes its mitigating force. ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug.26, 
 
7 
 
2010). However, payment by garnishment does not bar mitigation of financial concerns. 
ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep 26, 2006). 
 
 Applicant has been paying his legal fees when he is able. He is making payments 
under payment plans for the two credit-card debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. He has 
not yet reached payment agreements for the unsecured loan in SOR ¶ 1.d and the credit-
card debt in SOR ¶ 1.g. However, the adjudicative guidelines do not require that an 
individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged 
in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need 
only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
Applicant’s spread sheet reflects a detailed plan to resolve his debts, and he has taken 
substantial steps to implement it. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).2  
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. 
Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant 
additional comment. Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Air Force for 21 years and 
has held a security clearance since 1991. Except for three months working in the private 
sector, he has spent his entire adult life in support of national defense. He was candid, 
sincere, and credible at the hearing. I am confident that he will continue his efforts to be 
financially responsible.3 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under 
Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude 
Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. 
 
  
                                                          
2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding 
the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) 
the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for 
the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of 
continuation or recurrence.  
 
3 In the unlikely event that Applicant deviates from his current course of responsible conduct, the 
Government will have the right to reconsider the security significance of his past conduct in light of more 
recent conduct having negative security significance. ISCR Case No. 10-06943 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 
2012).

Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations); FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Clearance is granted.
