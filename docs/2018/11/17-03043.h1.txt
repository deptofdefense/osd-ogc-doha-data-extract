HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant did not make sufficient progress resolving her delinquent debts. She 
failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. 
Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
History of the Case 
  
On November 18, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for 
National Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On January 16, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in 
Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) The SOR set forth security concerns arising under 
Guideline F.  
 
On January 22, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR. (HE 3) On April 4, 2018, 
Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 26, 2018, the case was assigned to 
 
2 
                                         
 
me. On May 23, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a 
notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 13, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was 
held as scheduled.  
 
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; the content of 
Applicant’s exhibits was admitted into evidence; there were no objections; and all 
proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 15-16; GE 1-3). On June 21, 2018, 
DOHA received the hearing transcript.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.f. (HE 3) She also provided mitigating information. Her admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 59-year-old specialist in conducting inventories who is employed by a 
government contractor. (Tr. 5-9) In 1976, she graduated from high school. (Tr. 5) She has 
about two years of college. (Tr. 6) She married the same man twice, in 1977 and 1984, 
and they were divorced in 1983 and 1993. (Tr. 6) She married in 2005 and divorced in 
2010. (Tr. 6) Her children are ages 37 and 40. (Tr. 6) She adopted her three-year-old 
granddaughter in 2006, and Applicant has custody of her granddaughter. (Tr. 26-27) She 
served in the Army from 1976 to 1984; she left active duty as a Specialist 5 (E-5), and 
she received a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 7-8) She has been 
employed by the federal government or a government contractor for 41 years. (Tr. 8-9)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant received federal civil service retirement pay after July 2014. (Tr. 23-24) 
She had a period of unemployment from July 2015 to February 2016. (Tr. 22) In 2014, 
she withdrew $64,000 from her Thrift Savings Account, which increased her tax liability 
in 2014. (Tr. 24) The status of the financial issues alleged in the SOR is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2013 through 2015. For tax year 2013, Applicant said she thought that she filed 
her tax return about one week after her extension expired. (Tr. 30) The Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) advised her in 2017, that the IRS had not received her tax return for tax 
year 2013. (Tr. 50) The IRS recalculated her tax return, and she did not owe any taxes 
for tax year 2013. She was supposed to receive a refund; however, since her 2013 tax 
return was more than three years overdue, the IRS refused to credit her with the refund. 
Applicant said she did not timely file her tax returns because she was distracted by issues 
involving her grandchild and children. (Tr. 31) Her son and daughter-in-law are drug 
addicts; her son was incarcerated; and her grandchild was severely injured. (Tr. 31-32) 
Her son is not currently incarcerated; however, her daughter is now in jail. (Tr. 33) She 
                                            
1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits.

described the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI) 
as “a kick in the rear” to motivate her to file her federal income tax returns. (Tr. 34)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant owes delinquent federal income taxes for tax 
years 2013 through 2016. Applicant admitted that she has a debt for unpaid federal 
income taxes. (Tr. 34) Applicant provided tax transcripts for tax years 2013 through 2016, 
and information from those tax transcripts (GE 2) is depicted in the following table: 
 
Tax Year Date Tax 
Returns Filed 
Adjusted Gross 
Income 
Taxes Owed 
2013 Nov. 2, 2017  $0 
2014 May 27, 2017 $200,901  $8,366 
2015 May 27, 2017 $152,963 $1,303 
2016 May 27, 2017 $183,545 $2,541 
 
Applicant owes federal income taxes of $1,557 for tax year 2017, and she 
estimated that she owes about $12,500 in total to the IRS. (Tr. 51; IRS January 24, 2018 
letter) In February 2018, Applicant started making payments in compliance with her $384 
monthly payment plan to the IRS. (Tr. 35) She has made all of her scheduled payments. 
(Tr. 35-38) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d allege a charged-off debt for $1,434 and a debt placed for 
collection for $1,272 owed to the same creditor. On February 8, 2018, the creditor wrote 
thanking Applicant for payment of $315 and stating the current balance owed is $1,141. 
(Tr. 19) She conceded she “blew them off” and failed to make payments for several years. 
(Tr. 41) She is planning to continue to make payments until the debt is resolved. (Tr. 41) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off bank debt for $508. In her SOR response, 
Applicant said she intended to make two $254 payments in March 2018. At her hearing, 
she conceded that she did not get around to making the payments to resolve this debt. 
(Tr. 41-42) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a debt owed to Applicant’s landlord placed for collection for 
$4,223. On November 15, 2009, Applicant signed a one-year lease in which she agreed 
to pay $1,985 monthly for an apartment. (Tr. 19-20) She said she disputed her 
responsibility for this debt. (SOR response) She did not provide a copy of the 
correspondence disputing the debt. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $123. Applicant said the 
creditor agreed she did not owe the debt because it was paid in June 2015. (Tr. 42; SOR 
response) She asked the creditor to provide updated information to the credit reporting 
companies. (Tr. 42) The debt does not appear as delinquent on her February 2, 2018 
TransUnion, Equifax, and Experian credit reports. (SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant is past due $294 on a debt for $5,104. Her SOR 
response indicated the balance owed is $4,326, and the account is current. Applicant’s 
February 2, 2018 credit reports indicate the balance is $4,479, and her payment is 30 
 
4 
                                         
 
days past due in the amount of $92. (February 2, 2018 TransUnion credit report at 29; 
February 2, 2018 Equifax credit report at 24; Experian credit report at 29) Applicant said 
her payments on this credit card debt are current. (Tr. 42-43) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges Applicant is past due $343 on a debt for $5,003. The debt relates 
to Applicant’s 2005 vehicle. (Tr. 43) In December 2017, shortly after her son was released 
from jail, he wrecked Applicant’s vehicle; it did not have insurance; and it is in Applicant’s 
garage. (Tr. 43-46) The account is now $964 past due. (Tr. 43) She plans to pay off the 
debt. (Tr. 44)  
 
On March 21, 2018, Applicant paid a debt for $16,829 originally owed to a 
motorcycle company. (Tr. 20, 28) With employer matching, she is contributing $1,600 
monthly into a retirement plan. (Tr. 38) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
 
5 
                                         
 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
 
6 
                                         
 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(c) a history of not 
meeting financial obligations”; and “(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal . . . income tax 
returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.” The record 
establishes AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f).   
 
 Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
  
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue;  
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
 
7 
                                         
 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
Applicant provided some mitigating information. She was unemployed from July 
2015 to February 2016. Her children became addicted to illegal drugs, and she needed 
to adopt her grandchild. Her son wrecked her vehicle. She was divorced. These 
circumstances were beyond her control and adversely affected her finances. She is 
credited with mitigating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h. She resolved some 
debts and made payments to address some debts. She paid a large non-SOR debt.   
 
Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances when she failed to: (1) 
make payments on the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i; and (2) timely file her federal 
income returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. The failure to timely file tax returns is 
particularly problematic. 
 
A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal 
income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.2 For purposes of this 
decision, I am not weighing Applicant’s failure to timely file her federal income tax returns 
against her as a federal crime. The failure to timely file income tax returns has security 
implications because: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
                                            
2 Title 26 U.S.C, § 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  
 
Any person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to make 
a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . .  make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor . . . . 
 
A willful failure to make tax return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor 
without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States 
v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O’Brien v. 
United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931). 
 
8 
                                         
 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated 
to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of 
[a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no 
harm, no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well 
that ends well” analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified 
information with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant did not give good enough reasons for not timely filing her federal income 
tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2015. She knew she needed to timely file those 
federal income tax returns, and she did not show the requisite diligence in filing those tax 
returns. She did not make sufficient progress resolving the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 
1.i in light of her income from her current employment. There is insufficient assurance 
that similar problems will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, she failed 
to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
 
9 
                                         
 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 59-year-old specialist in conducting inventories. She has about two 
years of college. Her children are ages 37 and 40. She adopted her three-year-old 
granddaughter in 2006, and Applicant has custody of her. She served in the Army from 
1976 to 1984; she left active duty as a Specialist 5 under honorable conditions. She has 
been employed by the federal government or a government contractor for 41 years. She 
received federal civil service retirement after July 2014.  
 
Applicant provided some important mitigating information. Her finances were 
adversely affected by circumstances beyond her control. She resolved several debts and 
made sufficient payments on others to establish payment plans.   
 
The evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. For three years she has 
received significant income. She did not make sufficient progress resolving three of her 
SOR debts: SOR ¶ 1.e for about $508; SOR ¶ 1.f for $4,223; and SOR ¶ 1.i for $5,003.    
 
Based on the decisions of the DOHA Appeal Board, the evidence against grant of 
a security clearance outweighs the positive evidence of her background and financial 
responsibility. When a tax issue is involved, an administrative judge is required to 
consider how long an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS 
generates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin 
and complete making payments.3 In this case, there is no evidence that the IRS 
                                            
3 The emphasis of the Appeal Board on security concerns arising from tax cases is instructive. See 
ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, 
“His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security 
clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not 
reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted with the nation’s 
secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security 
clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s control adversely 
affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s wages, and 
emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and insufficient 
discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. 
Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his 
failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax years 2010 
through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except for $13,000, which 
was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 
and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children’s private college 
tuition and expenses, and spouse’s medical problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations 
regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns 
suggest that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established government rules and 
systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation 
marks and brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security 
clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. 
Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s 
reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.”). Applicant’s uncorroborated

generated her tax returns. She did not file her tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, and 
2015 until 2017. The primary problem here is that Applicant has known that she needed 
to file federal income tax returns for several years. She had a legal requirement to timely 
file her tax returns. Her actions raise unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more of a track record of behavior consistent with her 
obligations, Applicant may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her 
security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
consideration security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 1.a:    Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d:  For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g and 1.h:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.i:    Against Applicant 
  
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.
