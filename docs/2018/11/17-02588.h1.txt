GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 28, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On September 22, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), 
(December 10, 2016), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered 
individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or 
eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017.

The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), 
and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 It is unclear when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the case 
file. In a sworn statement, dated October 20, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the 
Government was prepared to proceed on November 6, 2017. The case was assigned to 
me on March 20, 2018. A Notice of Hearing was issued on June 29, 2018, scheduling the 
hearing for July 26, 2018. However, on July 13, 2018, Applicant’s newly-engaged attorney 
entered an appearance and requested a continuance as well as a change of venue. On 
July 16, 2018, for good cause shown, I granted those requests. An Amended Notice of 
Hearing was issued on July 16, 2018. I convened the hearing as re-scheduled on August 
9, 2018. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 6, Applicant exhibits 
(AE) A through AE S, and Administrative exhibit I were admitted into evidence without 
objection. Applicant testified. Based on information presented during the hearing, 
Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following language: “You 
failed to timely file your federal income tax return for tax year 2016, as required.” 
Applicant’s objection to the motion was overruled, and the motion was granted, thereby 
amending the SOR by adding SOR ¶ 1.i.1 The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 17, 
2018. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of 
that opportunity and timely submitted additional documents, which were marked and 
admitted into evidence as AE T through AE GG without objection. The record closed on 
September 27, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual 
allegations in the initial SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.h.). Applicant did not admit or deny 
SOR ¶ 1.i., but merely acknowledged and conceded the concerns, so a denial was 
registered as to that allegation. Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated 
herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the 
record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of 
fact:  
 
Applicant is a 51-year-old self-employed president of a defense contractor. He has 
been serving in a variety of positions, among them project manager and technical team 
lead with various companies in enterprise resource planning for over two decades. He is 
                                                          
1 Tr. at 81-83; Administrative exhibit I (Text of Proposed SOR Amendment). Applicant’s attorney 
re-asserted her objection under “due process grounds,” claiming that Applicant was not prepared to defend 
against new allegations at the time of the hearing. During a post-hearing submission, Applicant did 
subsequently address the concerns. See AE T (Supplemental Applicant Submission, dated September 27, 
2018).

a high school graduate, with a bachelor’s degree in computer science. In 1995-1996, he 
was an ordained minister. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. He was 
granted a secret clearance in 2005 that has been periodically renewed, as well as a top 
secret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) in 1999 or 
2000. Applicant was married in 1994. He has two adopted daughters, both born in 2012, 
as well as two adopted sons, born in 2011 and 2014. 
 
Financial Considerations2 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to several different factors: his S 
corporation business3 had its struggles throughout the years; in late 2009, his wife 
developed serious health issues; she lost income as a realtor due to the poor housing 
market and her health; he lost rental income from a rental property he owned; his 
accountants gave him misinformation on how to handle his business taxes; and the 
adoption of his children took three years to accomplish (2013 – 2016), rather than the 
expected one year, and additional expenses were incurred. The loss of income, his failure 
to timely pay payroll taxes; and his failure to maintain monthly payments under installment 
plans with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) eventually led to cancelled installment 
plans and the filing of tax liens.4  
 
Applicant timely filed his federal individual income tax returns for the tax years 
2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2017 by the required filing dates or by the 
required extended filing dates. The Amended SOR alleged, and Applicant conceded, that 
he failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2016.. He finally filed 
that income tax return in August 2018, nearly 12 months after the SOR was issued, and 
several days after the hearing was conducted. The IRS actually rejected the tax return 
because of errors appearing therein, but in late August 2018, the tax return was finally 
accepted by the IRS.5

3 An S corporation, for federal income tax purposes, is a closely held corporation that makes a valid 
election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, S 
corporations do not pay any income taxes. Instead, the corporation's income or losses are divided among 
and passed through to its shareholders. The shareholders must then report the income or loss on their own 
individual income tax returns.

20, 2018); Tr. at 35-37, 80-81. The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an 
individual’s gross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation 
to so file, the following applies: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title 
or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such

The adjusted gross income reported by Applicant in his federal individual income 
tax returns for those tax years was as follows: 2010: $296,134;6 2011: $243,804;7 2012: 
$237,581;8 2013: $218,642;9 2014: $85,523;10 2015: $197,949;11 2016: $212,099;12 and 
2017: $215,451.13 
 
Applicant failed to pay the required individual income taxes or S corporation taxes 
to the IRS for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015, as required. In June 2012, 
with an amount owed of $74,008, on behalf of the S corporation, an installment agreement 
was established with the IRS, calling for monthly payments of $2,000, increasing to 
$2,600 in January 2013; and increasing again in July 2013 to $3,299 per month.14 
Applicant contends he made the required payments under that agreement until December 
2013, but that month, due to insufficient funds, he failed to make the required payment. 
As a result, that installment agreement was terminated. Applicant did submit some 
documentation, in the form of cancelled checks and bank statements, to support his 
contentions that he had paid the IRS over $44,000 under the installment agreement.15  
 
Applicant contended that in the fall of 2014, or in March 2015, he submitted an 
Offer in Compromise through his accountant to the IRS. The offer was between 10 and 
                                                          
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom 
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with 
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect 
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first 
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5 
years" for "1 year."

30 percent of his unpaid debt. The offer was rejected in August 2016.16 However, during 
the 2015-2016 period in which the Offer in Compromise was being considered by the IRS, 
Applicant contended he made payments to the IRS totaling $16,000 ($500 for Applicant 
and $500 for his wife, each month), but the documentation submitted only supports 
payments of $14,500 in $500 increments.17 
 
On July 15, 2016, on behalf of his S corporation, noting that a federal tax lien had 
already been filed, Applicant agreed to another installment agreement with the IRS, 
covering the tax year 2010, with an amount owed of $30,264, calling for monthly 
payments of $600, commencing on August 28, 2016.18 Applicant made his monthly 
payments, and in June 2017, he made a final payment for $6,637.19  
 
On August 31, 2016, noting that a federal tax lien had already been filed, Applicant 
agreed to another installment agreement with the IRS, covering the individual income tax 
for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013, for $101,340. Under the agreement, 
Applicant agreed to commence making monthly payments of $1,407.50 on September 
20, 2016.20 For the period July 18, 2016 through July 17, 2017, the IRS credited Applicant 
with making only two such payments, with one applied to his 2010 taxes, and the other 
applied to his 2011 taxes. Applicant explained that he was unable to continue his 
payments under the installment agreement because one of his clients stopped paying 
him. During that period, because of interest, penalties, and unspecified other charges, 
Applicant’s balance increased from $116,611 to $117,873.21  
 
According to Applicant, as of August 3, 2018, the IRS indicated that his remaining 
unpaid individual income taxes totaled $153,698, as follows, by year: 2010: $9,701; 2011: 
$24,959; 2012: $38,706; 2013: $49,170; 2015: $31,164. Because he paid the IRS $5,000 
for his 2011 tax bill on August 6, 2018, he claims the balance was reduced to $148,698.22 
However, during the hearing, Applicant said that his taxes for the tax years 2010, 2011, 
2012, and 2013 are paid, and only 2014 and 2015 have remaining balances, both of which 
are on his installment agreement.23

The IRS filed tax liens individually against Applicant, his wife, as well as jointly 
against him and his wife, as follows: December 2014: $19,466;24 December 2014: 
$51,442;25 January 2015: $36,619;26 August 2016: $60,729;27 August 2016: $10,386;28 
August 2016: $10,394;29 and June 2017: $25,253.30 During his interview with an 
investigator for the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on April 20, 2017, 
Applicant claimed that he was unaware of any federal tax liens until after he completed 
his e-QIP in the fall (October) of 2016. He indicated that he attempted to dispute the liens 
to have them removed, because he had established installment agreements, but the IRS 
refused to do so, claiming the liens were valid.31 With the exception of the June 2017 lien, 
Applicant’s claim that he was unaware of the liens until after October 2016 is contrary to 
the information appearing on his July 2016 and August 2016 installment agreements, as 
both installment agreements clearly noted that a federal tax lien had already been filed. 
Applicant subsequently contended that he had disputed some of the liens with the IRS,32 
but he did not submit any documents from the IRS to indicate that any of the liens had 
been satisfied and released. 
 
In addition to his difficulties with respect to his federal income tax returns and the 
taxes he still owes the IRS, Applicant also failed to pay his state individual income taxes 
and S corporation taxes for the tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Applicant 
contended that he entered into an installment agreement with the state department of 
revenue in 2012, covering the taxes due for 2010 and 2011, and subsequently the unpaid 
taxes for 2012 and 2013 were added to it.33 Although he claimed that the taxes for those 
tax years were eventually paid by him, leaving a zero balance, he submitted only a copy 
of his 2010 state income tax return reflecting $5,380 taxes due,34 and despite claiming

filed solely against Applicant’s wife and the other filed against Applicant and his wife.

that there was an exhibit to support his claims, Applicant failed to submit documents, such 
as the installment agreement, or proof of payments under that agreement, to support his 
claims. In addition, there is also another installment agreement, dated January 22, 2018, 
reflecting a balance due of $16,799. Applicant added that, effective August 6, 2018, the 
total remaining balance for 2014 and 2015 has been reduced to $14,788.35 The most 
recent installment agreement requires Applicant to make 34 monthly $500 payments 
starting in February 2018, until the balance of $16,799 is paid off, and Applicant submitted 
evidence of six such payments between February 2018 and July 2018.36  
 
In addition to his federal and state taxes, Applicant also had a significant number 
of delinquent mortgage, credit card, auto loan, and medical debts. During 2018, he paid 
off a total of $38,480 in those debts, leaving unpaid debts totaling $8,493.37 
In May 2017, Applicant submitted a Collection Information Statement (Form 433-
F) to the IRS. The financial information reported that, in addition to his primary residence, 
Applicant owned a residence where his elderly dependent mother resided with a current 
value of $130,000, for which he was paying $595 per month on a balance of $64,500; 
and a car, a truck, and a 2014 van with a current van value of $20,000, for which he was 
paying $582 per month on a balance of $19,821.38 He reported $5,000 in his net monthly 
income; $1,000 in his wife’s net monthly income; and $5,898 in monthly expenses, 
including $2,107 in federal and state taxes under two installment agreements.39 At the 
hearing, Applicant produced a budget reflecting $15,506 in net monthly family income, 
including $2,006 in adoption assistance income; $7,360 in monthly expenses; and $7,355 
in “other” expenses, including payments on debts, credit cards, mortgage and property 
taxes, auto loan, cell phone, and $2,000 on his federal ($1,500) and state ($500) 
installment agreements. Also included in his “other” expenses were $500 for savings and 
college savings, and $100 for family vacations. He reported a monthly remainder of 
$791.40  
There is no evidence that Applicant has ever received financial counseling. In 
addition, while Applicant attributed his financial problems to several different factors, he 
failed to submit documents or other evidence to support his contentions. For example, his 
claim that his business “had its struggles throughout the years” seems to be without merit 
because his gross income, with the exception of 2014 when it was only $85,525, was

generally above $200,000.  His claim that his wife, to whom he referred as a “part-time 
referral real estate agent/independent contractor who works by commission only,” lost 
“substantial” commission-based income as a realtor due to a poor housing market is 
unsupported by any documents, either describing the local housing market or reporting 
her commissions during that unspecified period. He did submit an article describing her 
health issues that commenced sometime in 2006 and which were eventually resolved by 
2011.41 His claim that he lost rental income from a small rental property is unsupported 
by documents indicating his rental-income stream over the years, or the repairs he 
needed to make before selling that property. His claim that his accountants gave him 
misinformation on how to handle his business taxes is also unsupported by any 
documents. Furthermore, while there is evidence of recent (2018) payments of non-SOR 
delinquent debts well after the SOR was issued, as well as periodic tax payments under 
installment agreements, some of which were terminated because of Applicant’s failures 
to remain in compliance with those arrangements, there is little meaningful evidence to 
indicate that Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  
Character Reference and Award 
 The program manager of a U.S. Navy program for whom Applicant was a 
consultant in 2010 and 2011, noted that Applicant’s attention to detail coupled with his 
extensive knowledge and experience were invaluable in resulting in “amazing 
accomplishments.” Applicant’s professionalism and willingness to manage multiple 
priorities were truly appreciated, and his contributions were invaluable to the overall 
mission success.42 On May 22, 2018, Applicant was awarded an award of excellence for 
his consistent record of excellence and outstanding contributions to one particular 
corporation.43 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”44 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”45

When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”46 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.47  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”48  
 
                                                          
46 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 
at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla 
but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994).

Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”49 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:  
      
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG 19:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
                                                          
49 See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
 
 
11 
                                      
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2016 
until August 2018, well after the SOR was issued; failed to pay annual federal and state 
individual income taxes or payroll taxes as required; and, as of August 3, 2018, according 
to the IRS, he still owed the IRS $153,698 in unpaid income taxes, payroll taxes, interest, 
and penalties. He had a number of federal income tax liens filed. Although he entered 
into several installment agreements with the IRS over the years, two of those installment 
agreements were terminated because of Applicant’s failure to comply with the terms of 
those arrangements. A rejected Offer in Compromise only proposed a settlement of the 
tax debt of between 10 and 30 percent. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been 
established, and 19(b) has been partially established.  
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;50 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;51  
                                                          
50 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
51 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or 
statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].  
 
 
12 
                                      
 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is compliance with those arrangements.  
AG ¶¶ 20(b), 20(d), and 20(g) minimally apply, but none of the remaining mitigating 
conditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial 
difficulties make it difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent,” 
or that it is “unlikely to recur.” Applicant attributed his financial problems to several 
different generally unsubstantiated factors:  his business “had its struggles throughout the 
years,” although his gross income, with the exception of 2014 when it was only $85,525, 
was generally above $200,000; his wife - a part-time referral real estate agent and 
independent contractor - lost “substantial” commission-based income as a realtor due to 
a poor housing market; he lost rental income from a small rental property; and his 
accountants gave him misinformation on how to handle his business taxes. Applicant 
failed to produce documents to support his claims. 
As the president of a corporation, Applicant was expected to know and follow 
various financial requirements or to engage the services of those who do to enable the 
corporation to properly function. Although Applicant’s adjusted gross income in 2010 was 
$296,134, he started a multi-year course of conduct that year which, to this day, has not 
been resolved. He failed to seek financial guidance. It is troubling that on several 
occasions, Applicant entered into installment agreements with the IRS, and he failed to 
remain in compliance with those agreements, claiming that he had insufficient funds to 
do so.  However, insufficient funds to pay one’s income taxes is not a legitimate reason 
not to timely file one’s taxes, something Applicant did for the tax year 2016. Faced with 
federal tax liens filed over a multi-year period, and then with the possible loss of his 
security clearance in September 2017, well after the SOR was issued, Applicant finally 
initiated some serious efforts to address his non-SOR delinquent debts, and he made 
some periodic tax payments under installment agreements. However, Applicant’s history 
of making payments on his delinquent accounts over the years has not risen to the 
standard of good-faith efforts. As of August 2018, Applicant still owed the IRS between 
$148,698 and $153,698 in unpaid income taxes, payroll taxes, interest, and penalties. He 
also owes $8,493 in delinquent non-SOR debts. There is little meaningful evidence to 
indicate that Applicant’s financial situation is now under control.  
An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed 
on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment 
and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate 
                                                          
(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting 
ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).

threat to his or her own interests.52 In this instance, to date, there is minimal meaningful 
evidence that corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. While Applicant claimed 
to have insufficient funds to pay his federal or state income tax over several years, or to 
timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2016, the evidence regarding his 
adjusted gross income over a substantial period reveals that between 2010 and 2017, his 
adjusted gross income appears to be more than sufficient to make significant payments 
well before the SOR was issued. Applicant’s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances 
cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.53 
Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without 
further confirmed action, are insufficient. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
                                                          
52 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 
3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018).

evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.54  
  
There is some evidence mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant is a 51-year-old 
self-employed president of a defense contractor. He has been serving in a variety of 
positions, among them project manager and technical team lead with various companies 
in enterprise resource planning for over two decades. He has a good professional 
reputation. He was granted a secret clearance in 2005 that has been periodically 
renewed, as well as a top secret clearance with SCI access in 1999 or 2000. There is no 
evidence of any security violations. Applicant made some generally modest tax payments 
under installment agreements, and is currently making monthly $500 payments under his 
most recent installment agreement. In 2018, he paid off a total of $38,480 in non-SOR 
debts.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the tax year 2016 until August 
2018, well after the SOR was issued; failed to pay annual federal and state individual 
income taxes or payroll taxes as required; and, as of August 3, 2018, according to the 
IRS, he still owed the IRS $153,698 in unpaid income taxes, payroll taxes, interest, and 
penalties. He had a number of federal income tax liens filed. Although he entered into 
several installment agreements with the IRS over the years, two of those installment 
agreements were terminated because of Applicant’s failure to comply with the terms of 
those arrangements. A rejected Offer in Compromise only proposed a settlement of the 
tax debt of between 10 and 30 percent. Although he made some payments to the IRS 
before the SOR was issued in September 2017, Applicant’s most significant payments 
commenced in 2018, well after the SOR was issued. Considering all of the above, I am 
unable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:55 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
                                                          
54 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-
3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, seemingly avoiding the delinquent federal and state income tax and 
payroll taxes in his name, until well after the SOR was issued. Overall, the evidence 
leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability 
for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to 
mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. 
A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
