MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 5, 2016. 
On March 23, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on June 8, 2017. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on April 10, 2018, and requested a decision on the 
record without a hearing. On April 24, 2018, the Government sent a complete copy of its 
written case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents identified as Items 
1 through 5, to Applicant. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary 
response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the 
Government’s evidence. He received the FORM on May 8, 2018, and did not respond.

Item 1 contains the two pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 5 are admitted into 
evidence. The case was assigned to me on July 26, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant, age 55, divorced in March 2011 and has lived in a cohabitant 
relationship since March 2017. He has two children, ages 18 and 22. He earned his 
GED in 1981. Since then, he has completed numerous law-enforcement-related 
courses. In June 2010, Applicant retired after serving as a police officer for the same 
employer for 20 years. He worked as a police sergeant for another employer from 
August 2011 through September 2015, when he left to seek employment closer to 
home. Applicant maintains two part-time jobs: one, as a deputy sheriff since September 
2015; and the other, as an armed security officer since June 2016. In June 2016, a 
defense contractor offered him a part-time position as an investigator contingent upon a 
favorable determination of his first application for a security clearance. 
 
Because Applicant did not have the money to pay the anticipated taxes, he failed 
to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2014. 
He also failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2012 through 2016, 
which totaled $33,212 as of March 2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e), and his state income 
taxes for tax years 2012 and 2013, which totaled $4,541 as of December 2017 (SOR ¶ 
1.f).2 Applicant did not provide any documents to corroborate claims that he has worked 
with the IRS to resolve his federal tax debts.3 
 
Applicant has four other delinquent debts totaling $5,446 (SOR ¶¶ 1.g through 
1.j). One of those debts, a charged-off $1,400 revolving line of credit (SOR ¶ 1.h), 
relates to an investigations business he owned between September 2009 and 
December 2011. During this period, he worked cases during his off hours until he 
closed the business because its income was not enough to justify the time and money 
he invested to keep it running.4  
 
Although not alleged in the SOR,5 Applicant defaulted on student loans related to 
college courses for which he was registered in 2005 but never completed. He believed 
that he owed the college approximately $300 to $400. A September 2016 credit report 
                                                          
1 Unless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I extracted these facts from 
Applicant’s SOR answer (Item 1), his SCA (Item 2), and the summary of his June 2017 security clearance 
interview (Item 3). 
 
2 Item 2 at 38-39; Item 3 at 6-12, 15-16, 20. Because it was not alleged in the SOR, I may only consider 
his failure to timely file tax returns as a factor in evaluating mitigation and whole person. 
 
3 Item 2 at 38-39; Item 3 at 5 and 16. None of the tax transcripts note any installment agreements (Item 3 
at 6-12). 
 
4 Item 3 at 14-15, 18. 
 
5 Because it was not alleged in the SOR, I may only consider his student loan debt as a factor in 
evaluating mitigation and whole person.

listed two student loan accounts that were 120 days or more delinquent in the amount of 
$379 with an outstanding loan balance of $3,750.6 A January 2018 credit report listed 
both accounts with $0 balances, not as paid, but rather as assigned to the government 
and either transferred or sold.7 
 
Applicant’s financial problems began in June 2010, when he concurrently 
separated from his wife and retired. Applicant attributed his tax debts to a mistake that 
his employer made with respect to changes in the number of deductions that he claimed 
on his IRS income tax withholding form following his divorce. He did not discover the 
mistake until he filed his 2015 tax returns because never reviewed his paychecks as he 
was paid via direct deposit. He then adjusted his deductions to avoid this issue in the 
future. He filed his 2012 through 2014 tax returns in July 2016 and timely filed his 2015 
and 2016 tax returns.8 
 
With only one income that had been reduced by half (due to his retirement and 
subsequent underemployment) and increased divorce-related expenses (child support 
payments, higher premiums associated with providing health insurance for his two 
children, and the loss of his entire retirement income to pay monies awarded to his 
wife), he struggled to pay his $1,600 monthly mortgage payment and eventually fell 
behind with other bills. Upon the advice of his divorce attorney, Applicant stopped 
making his mortgage payments in February 2011. He resumed them in October 2012, 
after became gainfully employed and worked out a loan modification with his lender to 
stop foreclosure proceedings. Since then, he was late with his payments once, in 
December 2016, when his automatic payment did not process for some reason.9  
 
In 2012 or 2013, Applicant hired a law firm to help repair his credit and dispute 
accounts.10 After paying over $1,000, he ended his contract with the law firm after none 
of the disputed items were resolved during the course of a year. Instead, he decided to 
focus on increasing his income in order to repay his debts. However, he faced a 
roadblock in 2015 when he was not granted a waiver of the $30,000 retirement income 
cap imposed by New York State as his employer had promised, which required him to 
seek additional income to “make ends meet.”11 
 
Despite his income struggles, Applicant claimed that he was never late with his 
child-support payments or other financial responsibilities regarding his children, both of 
whom are now in college. However, a September 2016 credit report reflects that at least

one child-support account had been in collections at some point for reasons not 
specified in the record.12 
 
Applicant acknowledged that, after the divorce, he struggled with managing his 
finances because his wife handled the finances during their marriage and he was not 
used to budgeting. He was overwhelmed and too proud to ask for help. He has not 
sought financial counseling because he does not believe it will help as he does not have 
the funds to pay his debts. Applicant plans to resolve his debts either from the income 
he expects to earn if he is granted a security clearance or a refinance of his home once 
he improves his credit score. In support of mitigation, Applicant stated the following:  
 
I have been in Law Enforcement for over 33 years. I have never allowed 
my personal life to influence my professional life. I have an outstanding 
reputation and would never do anything to damage that. I am capable of 
handling the duties of background investigator with the utmost regard for 
protection of the safety and security of all information obtained in the 
course of my duties.13 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”14 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”15 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”16 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the

possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”17 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.18 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”19 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.20 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.21 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.22 
  
 An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”23 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”24 
 
Analysis 
 
 The concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise

questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.25 
Furthermore, “[f]ailure to file income tax returns suggests that an applicant has a 
problem with complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information.”26 
 
 Applicant’s failure to timely file his tax returns and pay his income taxes and his 
other unresolved delinquent debts establish three disqualifying conditions under this 
guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts), AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting 
financial obligations), and AG ¶ 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required). 
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the 
following potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and

26 ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). 
 
 
7 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
Applicant filed his delinquent tax returns and resolved his delinquent mortgage 
account before they became issues with respect to his security clearance. He also 
established a meaningful track record of remaining current with mortgage payments. 
However, while he sought the assistance of a law firm to dispute certain accounts and 
otherwise “repair” his credit, Applicant has not resolved the substantial tax and other 
debts alleged in the SOR. Although his divorce and retirement-related 
underemployment were circumstances beyond his control, Applicant has not met his 
burden to establish that he acted responsibly under those circumstances. In light of the 
record before me, I cannot conclude that Applicant has mitigated the Guideline F 
concerns at this time. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by his failure to timely pay federal and state income taxes and other 
delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information.

Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.j: Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
