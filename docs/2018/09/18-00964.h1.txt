HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 From 1998 to present, Applicant filed for bankruptcy five times. He did not establish 
that his actions were reasonable and prudent, and that he adhered to duty or obligation 
in the resolution of his debts. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On June 3, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Position (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1) On April 19, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 
1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (Directive), and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix 
A new adjudicative guidelines (AGs), effective June 8, 2017.  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
 
2 
                                         
 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
On May 1, 2018, Applicant provided a response to the SOR. (HE 3) On May 30, 
2018, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed in Applicant’s case. On 
June 4, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On June 4, 2018, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 
11, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and 
location of his hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 13) Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight substantive exhibits and one 
demonstrative exhibit; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; there were no objections; and 
all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 12, 15-17; GE 1-8; HE 4) On June 
19, 2018, DOHA received the hearing transcript.   
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 
1.i. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old senior systems administrator and information technology 
instructor, and a DOD contractor has employed him since May 2016. (Tr. 5, 19-20; GE 1) 
In 1993, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) In 2006, he received a bachelor’s degree, 
and in 2009, he received a master’s degree in teaching and learning technology. (Tr. 6-
7) From 1993 to 2004, he served in the Marine Corps, and from 2004 to 2016, he served 
in the Army. (Tr. 7, 21) He has nine and one half years of active duty service, and the 
remainder was in the Marine Corps and/or Army National Guard or Reserve. (Tr. 7, 21) 
He retired from the Army as a sergeant first class (E-7). (Tr. 7, 21) From May 2013 to 
November 2013, he served in Afghanistan working for a DOD contractor. (Tr. 8; GE 2) In 
1996, he married, and in 1997, he divorced. (Tr. 8) In 1999, he married, and his children 
are ages 6 and 11. (Tr. 9, 18-19)   
 
Financial Considerations 
 
From 2007 to 2012, Applicant served on active duty in the United States. (Tr. 21) 
Applicant was unemployed from May 2012 to September 2012, from January 2016 to 
May 2016, and two other periods of unemployment for two months or less. (Tr. 20-26; GE 
1; GE 2) Applicant is on temporary duty about half of the year, and his spouse handles 
payment of debts and filing his income tax returns. (Tr. 30-31, 36) His annual income from 
a contractor is about $50,000. (Tr. 35)

The status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $797. Applicant said the 
week before his hearing he made an arrangement with the creditor to pay $50 monthly. 
(Tr. 27-30) He did not provide proof of any payments. 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege student loans past due in the amount of $564 on a debt 
of $17,081 and $402 on a debt of $12,159. Applicant’s April 13, 2018, credit report 
indicates his most recent payments on these two student loans were in February 2014. 
(GE 3) In his SOR response, Applicant said “As of this 1st of May 2018 I was given 
authorization [by the creditor], to allow me 2 months of Deferment.” At hearing, Applicant 
said his student loans were in forbearance status until August 2018, and then he intends 
to apply for loan forgiveness, which reduces the monthly payment. (Tr. 32, 34) He 
estimated he owed about $42,000 on his student loans. (Tr. 33) He did not provide any 
documentation from the student loan creditors. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a charged-off debt for $398. Applicant said he was unable to 
contact the creditor despite calling the creditor’s phone number. (Tr. 37) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges, and Applicant admitted that he filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in July 1998, and his nonpriority unsecured debts were 
discharged in November 1998. (SOR response) Applicant said that his first spouse had 
some unnecessary expenses, including the purchase of encyclopedias for about $1,200 
without his permission; however, he did not remember why it was necessary to file for 
bankruptcy. (Tr. 39-41)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges, and Applicant admitted that he filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2005, and his nonpriority unsecured debts 
were discharged in March 2006. (SOR response) His nonpriority unsecured debts totaled 
$31,953. (GE 5 at 5) Applicant explained his income was low due to unemployment or 
underemployment. (Tr. 41-46; SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges, and Applicant admitted that he filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in January 2015, and his nonpriority unsecured debts 
were discharged in March 2016. (SOR response) His nonpriority unsecured debts totaled 
$41,510. (GE 6 at 15) Applicant explained that in 2012, his 2007 vehicle was repossessed 
because he was not making payments, and he was behind on his mortgage, some 
medical bills, and another car payment. (Tr. 46-51) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges, and Applicant admitted that he filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in July 2015, and his bankruptcy was dismissed in 
March 2016. (SOR response) The Chapter 13 was filed because Applicant was behind 
on his mortgage. (Tr. 52) He was successful in obtaining a loan modification, and then 
the Chapter 13 was dismissed. (Tr. 53)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges, and Applicant admitted that he filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code in April 2017, and his bankruptcy was dismissed in 
 
4 
                                         
 
April 2017. (SOR response) In 2017, he fell behind again on his mortgage and used the 
Chapter 13 process to obtain even lower payments on his mortgage. (Tr. 54-55) He now 
owes about $20,000 more for his home than his home’s fair market value. (Tr. 56) His 
monthly mortgage payment is $1,202 and constitutes about half of his monthly income. 
(Tr. 56) 
 
In the last five years, Applicant has had three vehicles repossessed. (Tr. 57-58) 
For two of the vehicles, his arrearage totaled more than $9,000. (Tr. 59; GE 6 at 9) In his 
2015 bankruptcy, he indicated his unsecured portion of his $155,751 mortgage was 
$12,588. (Tr. 58; GE 6 at 9)  
 
Applicant’s supervisor for about two years has contact with him about once a 
month. (Tr. 73) He described Applicant as reliable, responsible, diligent, honest, and a 
great employee. (Tr. 73-78) 
  
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
 
5 
                                         
 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established 
for issuing a clearance. 
 
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
 
6 
                                         
 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
 Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
  
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
 
7 
                                         
 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant said his first three 
bankruptcies were caused by divorce, underemployment, and/or unemployment. These 
circumstances were beyond his control and adversely affected his finances. AG ¶ 20(b) 
does not fully apply because he did not act responsibly under the circumstances.    
 
Applicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process and 
generated a budget. However, there are not clear indications that his financial problems 
are being resolved or that his finances are under control. 
 
Applicant receives partial mitigation under AG ¶ 20(d) by showing some good-
faith2 in the resolution of his SOR debts by admitting responsibility for them and  resolving 
all of them except for his mortgage and student loan debts through bankruptcy.    
 
Applicant filed for bankruptcy five times. In order to conclude that bankruptcy is 
necessary, clear and complete information about the impact of divorce, 
underemployment, and unemployment is necessary. Applicant failed to provide detailed 
financial information about his income. In addition, he said his student loans were in 
forbearance. He did not provide documentation showing the forbearance was necessary 
or approved. There is insufficient assurance that similar financial problems will not recur 
in the future. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial 
considerations security concerns. 
 
  
                                            
2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good-faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001))

Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 43-year-old senior systems administrator and information technology 
instructor, and a DOD contractor has employed him since May 2016. In 2006, he received 
a bachelor’s degree, and in 2009, he received a master’s degree in teaching and learning 
technology. From 1993 to 2016, he served in the Marine Corps and Army. He honorably 
retired from the Army as a sergeant first class. From May 2013 to November 2013, he 
served in Afghanistan working for a DOD contractor. In 1999, he married, and his children 
are ages 6 and 11.    
 
Applicant was divorced in 1997, and he had several periods of unemployment or 
underemployment. He filed for bankruptcy five times, and his debts were discharged in 
November 1998, March 2006, and March 2016. He did not meet his burden of providing 
that he showed reasonableness and prudence,  and adherence to duty or obligation in 
the resolution of his debts. He did not prove his student loans are in forbearance.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more of a track record of behavior consistent with his 
obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security 
clearance worthiness.  
 
 
9 
                                         
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
consideration security concerns are not mitigated. It is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant security clearance eligibility at this time. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.
