HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant settled and paid 9 of 12 delinquent debts listed on his statement of 
reasons (SOR). The creditors for two SOR debts are not seeking payment, and one SOR 
debt for $794 is in the process of being settled. Financial considerations security concerns 
are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.            
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On April 30, 2016, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions 
(SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On March 
2, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) 
issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive); Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National 
Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs) (June 8, 2017). The SOR set 
forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. (Hearing 
Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
On April 5, 2018, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested a 
hearing. (HE 3) On May 10, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On May 
 
2 
                                         
 
15, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On May 23, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings 
and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 13, 2018. 
(HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.   
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; Applicant offered 
seven exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into 
evidence. (Tr. 12-16; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE G) On June 21, 2018, DOHA 
received the hearing transcript. The record was held open until September 14, 2018. (Tr. 
47, 55) On September 10, 2018, Applicant provided nine additional exhibits, which were 
admitted without objection. (AE H-AE P)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied all of the SOR allegations. He also 
provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.    
 
 Appellant is a 32-year-old maintenance technician who has been working for the 
government contractor since April 2016. (Tr. 7-8, 17) In 2004, he graduated from high 
school. (Tr. 6) In 2013, he received two associate’s degrees. (Tr. 6) He has never served 
in the military. (Tr. 7) In 2016, he married, and his child is one month old. (Tr. 7, 17) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant has not been unemployed in the last five years. (Tr. 19) For several years 
until 2014, he was underemployed. (Tr. 21-22) His debts became delinquent while he was 
earning his associate’s degrees. (Tr. 24) His monthly net income without overtime is about 
$3,600. (Tr. 36) He has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 48) 
 
The status of the 12 debts totaling $45,371 alleged in the SOR is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $320. On 
March 22, 2018, Applicant paid this debt. (Tr. 26-27, 46; AE B) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a medical debt placed for collection for $157. On March 23, 
2018, Applicant paid this debt. (Tr. 26-27, 46; AE B) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a judgment for $2,283. On May 17, 2018, the law firm handling 
the judgment wrote that the payment of $752 satisfied the judgment. (Tr. 35, 46; AE A) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a debt for furniture placed for collection for $2,401. On August 
24, 2018, Applicant settled this debt for $720. (AE H) On August 28, 2018, the creditor 
acknowledged receipt of the payment and resolution of the debt.

SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off debt for furniture for $794. Applicant said he is 
working on a settlement of this debt.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a bank debt placed for collection for $27,588. On August 24, 
2018, Applicant paid $6,904 and settled this debt. (AE I) On August 28, the creditor wrote 
the debt was “settled in full.” (AE I) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $7,562. On August 17, 2018, the 
creditor wrote Applicant “We have closed your account and ceased collections. You have 
no further obligation regarding his account.” (AE J) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a debt placed for collection for $1,403. On August 27, 2018, 
Applicant settled the debt for $500. (AE K) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.i alleged an automotive debt placed for collection for $1,196. On August 
22, 2018, Applicant settled the debt for $300. (AE L)

SOR ¶ 1.l alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $246. On August 14, 2018, 
Applicant settled the debt for $100. (AE O) 
 
In April 2017, Applicant hired a credit-repair company (CRC) to “repair and clean 
up” his credit report by seeking validation or removal of derogatory information from his 
credit report.  (Tr. 28-29, 38; AE C) From March to August 2017, he paid the CRC about 
$2,000. (Tr. 39) CRC did not pay any of his creditors. (Tr. 39) On April 4, 2018, CRC 
wrote that Applicant’s credit report was repaired and only two delinquent accounts with 
balances remained, that is, the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (AE C) On May 29, 2018, 
CRC wrote to Applicant and explained the debts removed from his credit report were “past 
the federal statute of limitations for reporting and so they are not owed and are deleted 
off of your credit report.” (AE D) Applicant believed CRC’s representations that his debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.l were resolved. (Tr. 40) Applicant admitted that he owed the 
SOR debts before CRC began helping him with his credit. (Tr. 32-33)  
 
In sum, Applicant settled and paid nine delinquent SOR debts totaling $36,336. 
The creditors for two SOR debts are not seeking payment, and one SOR debt for $794 is 
in the process of being settled.   
 
Applicant’s vehicle loan and student loans are current. (Tr. 41) He loves his job 
and wants to support his family. (Tr. 43, 49) He uses a budget. (Tr. 49) He said he wanted 
to resolve his SOR debts even though they are not legally enforceable. (Tr. 42-43, 47) 
After his hearing, he resolved the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.h-1.j, and 1.l.

Character Evidence 
 
Applicant’s brother-in-law described Applicant as very trustworthy, ethical, reliable, 
honest, and reliable. (Tr. 52-53) He is proud that Applicant is his brother-in-law. (Tr. 54) 
Two supervisors where he is employed said Applicant is diligent, trustworthy, responsible, 
and highly motivated to be successful. (AE E; AE F) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
 
5 
                                         
 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; and “(c) a history of 
not meeting financial obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 
2010), the Appeal Board explained: 
 
 
6 
                                         
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,2 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
                                            
2 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
7 
                                         
 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
The CRC advised Applicant that the debts in SOR ¶ 1.d through 1.l were dropped 
from his credit report. “[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not 
meaningful evidence of debt resolution.” ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 
2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit 
Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven 
years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because 
of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.3 Debts may be dropped from a credit 
report upon dispute when the creditor believes the debt is not going to be paid, the creditor 
fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company’s request for information, or when 
the debt has been charged off. “Mere evidence that debts no longer appear on credit 
reports is not reason to believe that they are not legitimate or that they have been 
satisfactorily resolved.” ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) (citing 
ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015)).  
 
Applicant settled all of the debts, except the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g, and 1.k. The 
creditors for the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.k advised Applicant that the accounts were 
closed and collection was not being sought. He is working with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.e 
($794) to resolve this debt. Applicant’s financial problems were caused by 
underemployment and lack of income while he was attending college. Underemployment 
is a circumstance beyond his control.  
 
Applicant showed due diligence and good faith by contacting his creditors and 
settling nine SOR debts totaling $36,336. Applicant’s vehicle loan and student loans are 
current. There are clear indications that his financial problem is resolved, and his finances 
are under control. Future financial problems are unlikely to occur. AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 
20(d) are established, and financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
                                            
3Title 15 U.S.C. § 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit 
Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-
act.pdf. 
 
8 
                                         
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Appellant is a 32-year-old maintenance technician who has been working for a 
government contractor since April 2016. In 2013, he received two associate’s degrees. In 
2016, he married, and his child is one month old. Applicant’s brother-in-law and two 
managers at his place of employment described Applicant as very trustworthy, ethical, 
reliable, honest, and reliable.  
 
Applicant paid and settled 9 out of 12 SOR debts. The creditors for two SOR debts 
are not seeking payment, and one SOR debt for $794 is in the process of being settled. 
His vehicle loan and student loans are current. The Appeal Board has addressed a key 
element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating:  
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is 
not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off 
each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has . . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his [or her] outstanding indebtedness is 
credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (Available, reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, 
should be considered in reaching a determination.) There is no requirement 
that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. 
Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the 
payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that 
the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the 
ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). Applicant has established a track record of paying his debts. 
 
9 
                                         
 
Applicant’s actions show financial responsibility and judgment and favorably 
resolve questions about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified information. See AG ¶ 18. Future financial problems are unlikely to occur. I have 
carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the 
AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that 
financial consideration security concerns are mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.l:  For Applicant 
 
    Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
