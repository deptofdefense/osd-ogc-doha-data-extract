Remand Decision 
______________ 
 
NOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Department of Defense’s (DOD) intent to revoke her 
eligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Although Applicant 
has taken some steps to resolve her outstanding tax debt, she has failed to address the 
underlying problem and establish that her tax problems are under control. Applicant’s 
continued access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 3, 2016, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing 
security concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were 
unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue 
Applicant’s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an 
administrative judge for a determination whether to revoke her security clearance.  
 
                                                          
1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as 
amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified 
Information, implemented on September 1, 2006.

Applicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing.2 Initially, this case 
was scheduled for September 27, 2017. On September 20, 2017, the Government gave 
notice of its intention to amend the SOR.3 In response, Applicant requested a 
continuance, which I granted without objection from Department Counsel. On 
September 29, 2017, I issued a prehearing order to the parties regarding the exchange 
and submission of discovery, the filing of motions, and the disclosure of any witnesses, 
and the parties complied.4 At the hearing, which proceeded as rescheduled on 
November 15, 2017. I admitted Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 and Applicant’s 
Exhibits (AE) A, over Department Counsel’s objection, and B through N, without 
objection. I left the record open until December 15, 2017, to allow the Applicant to 
submit additional information. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on December 1, 2017.5 
Applicant timely submitted AE O through S, without objection from Department 
Counsel.6 These documents are referred to as the “December 2017 Submission” in this 
Remand Decision.   
 
Based on the available record, I issued a Decision, dated May 2, 2018, denying 
Applicant’s continued access to classified information. Applicant appealed the Decision 
and on August 21, 2018, the Appeal Board remanded the Decision for further 
processing consistent with the Directive, specifically: 
 
1. Confirming the contents of the December 2017 Submission with the 
parties to ensure record contains the documents Applicant intended to 
submit; and 
 
2. Issuing a new decision addressing, as appropriate, the other errors raised 
by the Applicant in her appeal brief.  
 
Post-Hearing Submissions 
 
Applicant’s December 2017 Submission contained 14 documents for 
consideration. The Appeal Board identified inconsistencies related to AE R, a series of 
IRS Annual Installment Letters. The December 2017 Submission included letters for the 
following time periods:  
 
 June 9, 2012 to July 8, 2013 (2 pages);  
 
 July 7, 2014 to July 13, 2015 (4 pages, including a payment detail page for 
July 8, 2013 to July 7, 2014);

However, AE S was citied in the Decision in footnotes 8 and 12.

 July 7, 2014 to July 13, 2015 (5 pages, including 2 duplicate pages); 
 
 July 13, 2015 to July 11, 2016 (3 pages);  
 
 July 12, 2015 to July 11, 2016 (3 pages, duplicate); 
 
 July 18, 2016 to July 17, 2017 (3 pages); and  
 
 July 18, 2016 to July 17, 2017 (3 pages, duplicate). 
 
Applicant’s post-hearing submission did not contain the annual installment agreement 
letter for July 8, 2013 to July 7, 2014 as indicated in her appeal brief.  Also, the letters, 
as submitted for each time period, were incomplete.  
 
On August 28, 2018, I reopened the record to allow Applicant to review the 
December 2017 Submission for completeness and to file the documents necessary to 
cure any defects. Applicant timely submitted AE T, which is admitted without objection 
from Department Counsel. AE T contains a coversheet and five IRS Annual Installment 
Agreement Letters for the following time periods: 
 
 June 9, 2012 to July 8, 2013 (4 pages);  
 
 July 8, 2013 to July 7, 2014 (4 pages);  
 
 July 7, 2014 to July 13, 2015 (4 pages); 
 
 July 13, 2015 to July 11, 2016 (4 pages); and  
 
 July 18, 2016 to July 17, 2017 (4 pages)  
 
Also on the AE T coversheet, Applicant confirmed that the documents identified as AE 
O through AE Q, and AE S, as part of the December 2017 Submission are complete as 
admitted. 
 
I have reviewed the contents of AE T and have considered them in issuing this 
Remand Decision.  
 
Formal Findings  
 
I have corrected the Formal Findings section to conform to the findings of fact, 
resolving SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d in Applicant’s favor. 
 
Other Errors as Identified by Applicant 
 
The Appeal Board also identified other errors Applicant raised in her Appeal 
Brief, those matters are clarified as appropriate in the Remand Decision, below.

Procedural Matters 
 
Application of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines 
 
 While the case was pending decision, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) 
issued Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive 
position. The 2017 AG superseded the AG implemented in September 2006, and they 
are effective for any adjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have 
applied them in this case. 
 
Motion to Amend the SOR 
 
 Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to correct a clerical error in SOR 
¶ 1.e, and to add allegations ¶¶ 1.h – 1.j. Applicant answered the amended SOR 
allegations and did not object. The motion is granted, the SOR is amended, and 
Applicant’s answers are entered into the record.7  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant is a systems engineer. She has worked for her current employer, a 
federal contractor, since August 2012. Applicant has held a security clearance since at 
least 1997. She completed her most recent security clearance application in August 
2014, seeking higher level access. On her August 2014 application, she reported 
federal and state income tax issues for 2009 through 2011. The ensuing investigation 
revealed additional federal and state income tax issues for 2013 and 2016. The SOR 
alleges five state tax liens, covering  tax years 2006 to 2011, filed in September 2013 
(¶1.a), November 2013 (¶ 1.b), February 2014 (¶ 1.c), October 2015 (¶ 1.d), and April 
2016 (¶ 1.e); and one federal tax lien for 2010 and 2011, filed by the IRS in October 
2011 (¶ 1.f). The SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her 2011 federal 
income tax returns (¶ 1.h), and that she failed to timely pay her 2011, 2013, and 2016 
federal income tax liabilities (¶¶ 1.h – 1.j). The SOR also alleges an $822 delinquent 
debt for a timeshare (¶ 1.g), which was paid in full in October 2017.8 
 
 Applicant, who files tax returns jointly with her husband, began experiencing tax 
problems in 2006, when they could not afford to pay their state tax liability. In 2009, they 
owed federal and state income taxes that they could not afford to pay. In 2010, 
Applicant incurred federal and state income tax liabilities because she did not have any 
income taxes withheld from her pay, which she blames on an oversight. Because 
Applicant did not review her paystubs or monitor the bank account she shared with her 
husband, she did not notice that income taxes were not deducted from her pay.9 In

2011, the IRS assessed additional taxes against Applicant for failure to report a $40,000 
withdrawal from her retirement account during that year.10 Applicant claims that they did 
not learn until 2013, that their tax preparer failed to file the couple’s 2011 federal income 
tax return or  request an extension of time to file the return.11 Despite incurring penalties 
for their tax preparer’s failure to timely file their tax return, the couple did not file a 
complaint against the preparer with the IRS. The couple filed the missing return in 
March 2013. The tax transcripts show that Applicant and her husband also filed their 
2009 and 2015 federal income tax returns late. The returns were filed in 2011 and late 
2016, respectively.12  
 
 The couple has taken steps to resolve their outstanding state and federal tax 
liabilities. The state tax authority confirmed that the liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($1,378) 
and 1.d ($7,309) were mistakenly attributed to Applicant and she does not owe them.13 
The liens alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($12,255) and 1.c ($1,980) were paid in March 2017 
and September 2017, respectively, and have been released.14 Applicant has been in a 
payment plan of $266 per month since August 2016 for the state tax lien alleged in SOR 
¶ 1.e ($5,731) and the account is in good standing. According to AE J, Applicant’s 
husband committed to an installment agreement with the IRS, dated July 7, 2017, to 
resolve $48,575 in outstanding federal taxes for 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2016. The 
Applicant is in compliance with the agreement, which requires her to pay $608 each 
month. Under the agreement, the payment will increase to $700 in August 2018 and to 
$810 in August 2019. Although the 2013 ($91) and 2016 ($1,700) balances were 
included in the July 2017 installment agreement, Applicant provided receipts showing 
they paid those balances separately in August 2017. Applicant’s husband indicated that 
the failure to pay the 2013 and 2016 balances on time was an oversight.15 
 
 At the hearing, Applicant and her husband testified about their roles in managing 
the household finances. Applicant’s husband handles all the couple’s financial matters. 
Before this adjudication, Applicant testified that she did not ask for the details of the 
couple’s finances and her husband did not volunteer them. She does not know who 
prepares the couple’s taxes, but assumes her husband hires someone because she has 
never seen him complete the forms. The preparer Applicant’s husband used for a 
number of years, including 2011, was convicted on federal charges of preparing 
fraudulent income tax returns for at least 11 taxpayers between 2008 and 2011. 
Applicant and her husband were not named as victims in the indictment. Applicant’s 
husband also communicates with the IRS and state tax authority to establish and 
maintain payment plans. Applicant’s involvement in the couple’s tax preparation is

limited to providing her husband any documentation he may need. Although Applicant 
was aware they owed taxes, she was unaware of the extent of tax issues until her 
September 2014 subject interview, where she learned about the tax liens for the first 
time.16  
 
Applicant’s husband admits that they have been in tax payment plans off-and-on 
since 2006, which is confirmed by the tax transcripts in the record.  According to AE T, 
Applicant did not start paying on her delinquent 2009 federal taxes until February 2012. 
Between February 2012 and June 2015, Applicant made 14 payments toward her 
outstanding federal tax debt. Applicant’s husband could not identify a specific event that 
prevented them from being able to timely pay their federal and state tax liabilities or 
adhering to their payment plans. He speculated that his wife’s health issues or other 
family matters could have been a factor, but he did not cite any particular event that 
prevented them from satisfying their income tax obligations as required. At hearing, he 
admitted that he did not pay close attention to their tax obligations before the present 
case made it an issue. Since July 2015, 10 months after Applicant first learned the 
extent of her federal tax problem, she has made consistent payments toward her federal 
tax liabilities.17 
 
For her part, Applicant claims that she has a better understanding of the family 
finances and discusses them with her husband weekly. While she was able to discuss 
the status of the SOR debts, she could not provide details about the circumstances 
causing the state and federal tax liabilities. Other than Applicant’s statements at hearing 
that she spent weeks with her [financial advisor] to gain a better understanding of the 
parameters of her Individual Retirement Account,18 Applicant and her husband did not 
present evidence that they obtained any financial counseling related to managing their 
recurring finances or their federal and state income obligations. Applicant’s husband 
maintains responsibility for retaining the couple’s tax preparer. At the hearing, he was 
unable to provide their preparer’s name, credentials, or qualifications. None of the 
documents in evidence establish that the couple has retained a reputable tax preparer. 
Applicant did not provide this information in her post-hearing submissions.19  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
                                                          
16 Tr. 39-42, 81-82, 105 - 109 126-127, 144-145; AE S. 
 
17 Tr. 135.  
 
18 Tr. 54.  
 
19 Tr. 54-55, 120-121, 134-136, 145-147, 151-154.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record.  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms of the 
national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites 
for access to classified or sensitive information).  
 
Analysis 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations 
may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgement, or willingness to abide by rules and 
regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.20  
 
The record establishes the Government’s prima facie case, that Applicant has 
failed to timely file and pay annual federal and state taxes as required, resulting in 
                                                          
20 AG ¶ 18.

approximately $20,000 in delinquent state taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.e) and 
approximately $48,600 in delinquent federal taxes (SOR ¶¶  1.f, 1.h - 1.j).21 Applicant’s 
failure to timely pay her state and federal income tax obligations also demonstrates a 
history of not meeting financial obligations as well as an inability to satisfy debts.22 
Applicant did present some mitigating evidence. Applicant resolved the delinquent 
timeshare debt (SOR ¶ 1.g). She successfully disputed two of the alleged state tax liens 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d).23 She has paid two of the state tax liens (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c), as 
well as the outstanding federal taxes for 2013 and 2016 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j). She has 
made arrangements with the with the state and federal tax authorities to the pay her 
remaining delinquent income taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f) and is compliance with those 
arrangements.24 However, this is not enough to mitigate the underlying concern. 
Applicant still owes at least $40,000 in outstanding federal taxes. 
 
Applicant and her husband have a 12-year history of tax problems largely of their 
own making. They failed to manage their tax obligations. While they are taking steps to 
pay their outstanding state and federal tax balances, they did not do so until the 
potential loss of Applicant’s security clearance made it priority. Applicant did not 
demonstrate financial rehabilitation or reform of their tax practices. She did not provide 
any evidence to show that she and her husband will not encounter similar tax problems 
in the future. Applicant failed to articulate a sustainable tax management strategy. She 
did not establish that she has hired a reputable tax professional, or that she attended 
financial counseling aimed toward managing her state and federal tax obligations. Given 
Applicant’s history of sporadic repayment efforts, she did not provide sufficient evidence 
of her ability to adhere to the established state and federal tax repayment plans. 
Ultimately, Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence that her tax problem is under 
control.  
 
After a review of the record and a consideration of the whole-person factors at 
AG ¶ 2(d), I conclude that Applicant’s history of tax problems render her unsuitable for 
continued access to classified information at this time. Her status as a long time 
clearance holder is not enough to outweigh the security concerns raised by her history 
of tax problems.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Financial Considerations:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g - 1.h: For Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.e - 1.f, 1.i – 1.j:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied.
