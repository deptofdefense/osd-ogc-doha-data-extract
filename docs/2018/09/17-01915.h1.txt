Decision 
___________ 
 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant provided insufficient evidence that he was unable to make greater 
progress addressing his substantial delinquent child-support debt. Financial 
considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied.            
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On January 8, 2015, Applicant signed a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) 
On June 21, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. 
Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD 
Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program 
(Directive), January 2, 1992, Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in 
Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
On August 11, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested 
a hearing. (HE 3) On September 11, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. 
On February 16, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On March 14, 2018, the Defense 
 
2 
                                         
 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing 
for April 2, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.   
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered 4 exhibits; Applicant offered 12 
exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. 
(Tr. 10-12; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE L) On April 13, 2018, DOHA received the 
hearing transcript. Applicant provided two exhibits after his hearing, which were admitted 
without objection. (AE M-AE N) The record was scheduled to close on May 2, 2018. (Tr. 
81, 86) The record was closed on August 20, 2018. (AE N)  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted he incurred the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 
1.b, and 1.g. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are 
accepted as findings of fact.   
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old project manager, and a government contractor has 
employed him since September 2015. (Tr. 41, 54, 56) His expertise is in cyber security. 
(Tr. 56) In 2008, he received a bachelor’s degree, and in 2014, he received a master’s 
degree in business administration. (AE A) His children are ages seven and nine. (Tr. 76) 
 
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps for seven years and in 
the Reserve from 1997 to 2010 or 2012. (Tr. 40-41: GE 1; AE A) He served a tour in the 
Republic of Korea. (Tr. 79) His highest award was the Navy and Marine Corps 
Achievement Medal. (Tr. 80) He received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 41; GE 1) From 
2001 to 2012, he was married, and he has one child from that marriage. (Tr. 41; GE 1) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant was unemployed from October 2013 to May 2014. (Tr. 42) His current 
annual income is $145,000. (Tr. 50) He said he currently pays $1,000 monthly for each 
of his two children in child support. (Tr. 50-51) He does not pay for his children’s medical 
insurance. (Tr. 51) There is no child-support order for his nine-year-old child. (Tr. 58) 
 
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts, and the record establishes that he has 
mitigated all of his SOR debts except for his child-support debt. The status of Applicant’s 
SOR accounts is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a child-support debt placed for collection for $35,561. Applicant 
initially had a court-ordered monthly child-support payment of $342. (Tr. 47) He was 
unable to make his child-support payments during his unemployment in 2013. (Tr. 48, 58) 
In May 2015, the court issued a default order increasing his monthly payment to $1,582 
with $118 going toward an unspecified arrearage. (Tr. 49; AE J) The court indicated his 
payments were to be made by wage lien. (AE J) In 2015, the court denied his motion to 
                                            
1 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 
                                         
 
reduce his monthly child-support payments. (Tr. 72) He said he paid $800 monthly in child 
support for a time, and he has been paying $1,000 monthly since 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 50-
51, 59, 77; SOR response, AE A) His documentation indicates that in the first five months 
in 2017 he averaged $600 monthly in child-support payments. (AE J) He said he is 
negotiating a settlement of his child-support arrearage. (Tr. 59-60) He did not provide 
proof of any payments after June 2017. (AE J) The current arrearage is about $42,000. 
(Tr. 61) The child-support debt relates to his seven-year-old child. (Tr. 77) His child-
support debt has increased $7,000 in the last year. (Tr. 77) Three weeks before his 
hearing, he hired an attorney to help him resolve the child-support debt. (Tr. 73) He paid 
the attorney $1,700. (Tr. 73) He hoped to settle the child-support arrearage for about 
$5,000. (Tr. 74) 
 
On March 21, 2018, the woman (Ms. K) who is supposed to receive the child 
support from Applicant as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a indicated Applicant is “a reliable person, 
a responsible parent, and a dependable worker.” (AE D) Ms. K said that he “lost his job 
and as a result some of his financial obligations were put on hold. He has initiated a good-
faith effort to repay overdue creditors and resolve debts.” (AE D)  
 
On May 2, 2018, Applicant provided a requested amendment of his child support 
that he filed with the family court. (AE M) Applicant and Ms. K signed the agreement. It 
indicated Applicant did not have to pay child support to the state child support 
enforcement entity. (AE M) The agreement indicates his child-support arrearage places 
his security clearance in jeopardy. (AE M) The agreement allows Applicant to pay his 
child support directly to Ms. K, and it reduces his support obligation to $800 with $200 of 
that to go towards his arrearage. (AE M) It also asks the court “to terminate the current 
child-support obligation as well as the current arrears.” (AE M) On July 11, 2018, I granted 
a delay until August 10, 2018, to permit Applicant to submit the family court’s disposition 
for consideration in his security clearance assessment. (AE N) I held the record open until 
September 10, 2018, and did not receive any post-hearing documentation from Applicant 
after May 2, 2018.     
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a charged-off vehicle loan for $11,452. Applicant’s vehicle was 
stolen and recovered, and then the insurance company declared the vehicle a total loss. 
(Tr. 51) The insurance company did not pay the full amount of the lien. (Tr. 52) On August 
8, 2017, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $3,800. (AE E) Applicant said he paid 
the debt around March 2017. (Tr. 52, 60) His March 29, 2018 Experian credit report 
indicates the original debt was for $44,185, and the debt was paid in full for less than the 
full balance. (AE K at 21)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $160. This debt resulted from a utility bill 
related to a rental property. (Tr. 42) He said he paid the debt. (Tr. 43; AE F) His March 
29, 2018 Experian credit report indicates the debt is paid. (AE K at 20) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges a debt placed for collection $635.  Applicant said his credit card 
went into default during his period of unemployment, and the debt was paid. (Tr. 43) His 
March 29, 2018 Experian credit report indicates he has a current account with the same 
 
4 
                                         
 
creditor for $5,091. (AE K at 5) His March 27, 2018 Equifax credit report indicates he has 
a paid account with the same creditor with a previous high balance of $941. (AE L at 19) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f allege two student loan debts placed for collection for $4,575. 
Department Counsel moved to withdraw SOR ¶ 1.f as a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.e; there 
was no objection; and I granted the motion. (Tr. 8) The creditor offered to settle the debt 
for $2,287. (SOR response) Applicant said the debt became delinquent when he was 
unemployed, and on August 11, 2017, he settled the debt. (Tr. 43-44; SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $2,286. Applicant was unaware 
of the maintenance fees on a timeshare. (Tr. 45) Once he learned of the debt, be paid it. 
(Tr. 45-46) He provided a checking account statement showing he paid this debt in August 
2017. (Tr. 62; AE G) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $379. 
Applicant said the debt became delinquent during his period of unemployment, and in 
July 2016, he paid this debt. (Tr. 46; SOR response; AE H) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l allege four vehicle-related tickets for $205, $105, $55, 
and $55. (Tr. 47) In August 2017, he paid these four debts. (AE I) 
 
Applicant’s financial case action plan (plan) in January 2015 indicated net monthly 
income of $4,740, living expenses of $6,025, and negative monthly shortfall of $1,285. 
(SOR response) His plan indicated his monthly child support was $342 and his arrearage 
was $2,617. (SOR response) 
 
Applicant does not owe any delinquent taxes, except for about $1,000 in delinquent 
state income taxes. (Tr. 46, 70-71) He is making payments to address his state tax debt. 
He has about $17,000 in his savings accounts and about $45,000 in his retirement 
account. (Tr. 64-65) In 2016, he purchased a vehicle for about $39,000, and his monthly 
payment is $868. (Tr. 67) His student loan debt of about $60,000 is current. (Tr. 67) He 
indicated he had a monthly remainder after deducting expenses of about $2,000, which 
he used to pay past-due debt. (Tr. 67) He received financial counseling and generated a 
budget. (Tr. 71; SOR response) His financial counselor advised him not to use his 
retirement fund to pay his child-support arrearage. (Tr. 74) His 2018 credit reports 
generally indicate he is paying his debts, and his accounts are current. (AE K; AE L) 
 
Three co-workers have worked with Applicant for about two years and in one 
instance has known him for six years. They described him as very professional, ethical, 
and trustworthy. (Tr. 17-36) They were all aware of Applicant’s financial problems, and 
they nevertheless, recommended reinstatement of Applicant’s security clearance. (Tr. 19, 
29, 36) Two statements from character witnesses indicate their friendships extended from 
16 to 22 years, including during his military service. (AE B; AE C) They lauded his 
reliability, responsibility, trustworthiness, judgment, loyalty, and diligence. (AE B; AE C)

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
 
6 
                                         
 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b). 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(b) unwillingness to 
satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so”; and “(c) a history of not meeting financial 
obligations.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board 
explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for 
the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.

(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG           
¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of 
mitigating conditions. 
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,2 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
  
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
The DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving 
the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
                                            
2 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
  
Applicant presented some mitigating evidence. He was unemployed from October 
2013 to May 2014, which is a circumstance largely beyond his control. He is credited with 
mitigating all of his SOR debts except for his child-support debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. He does 
not receive full mitigating credit under AG ¶ 20(b) because he did not act responsibly 
under the circumstances. He received financial counseling and generated a budget.  
 
Applicant’s child-support payments to Ms. K for the first five months of 2017 
averaged $600. He did not provide evidence of any child-support payments after June 
2017. He did not explain why he reduced his payments from the $1,000 monthly level of 
the previous year to $600 monthly in 2017. Even if the court approved a new child-support 
payment plan, I am not convinced he would abide by it.3 In 2015, the court ordered him 
to make his child-support payments automatically from his salary, and he did not comply 
with that order. His child-support arrearage has increased in the previous 12 months even 
though his annual income is $145,000. 
 
Applicant did not prove that he was unable to make greater progress resolving his 
child-support arrearage. There is insufficient assurance that this debt is being resolved. 
Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish that financial considerations security 
concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
                                            
3 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a 
substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). A promise to pay debts is given greater weight when there is a track 
record of paying other debts. 
 
9 
                                         
 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old project manager, and a government contractor has 
employed him since September 2015. His expertise is in cyber security. In 2008, he 
received a bachelor’s degree, and in 2014, he received a master’s degree in business 
administration.  
 
Applicant served in the Marine Corps from 1997 to 2010 or 2012. His highest award 
was the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and he received an honorable 
discharge. The general sense of the statements of three co-workers, two friends, and the 
mother of his youngest child is that Applicant is very professional, ethical, loyal, diligent, 
and trustworthy.   
 
Applicant presented some mitigating financial evidence. Applicant was 
unemployed from October 2013 to May 2014, which is a circumstance largely beyond his 
control. He received financial counseling and generated a budget. He mitigated all of his 
SOR debts except for his child-support debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant has a generally good 
credit report with a solid record of financial responsibility, except for the debt in SOR ¶ 
1.a.  
 
Applicant did not establish he had insufficient income to make greater progress 
resolving his child-support arrearage. His actions show a lack of financial responsibility 
and judgment and raise unmitigated questions about Applicant’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG ¶ 18. More 
information about inability to pay debts, financial history, or documented financial 
progress addressing his child-support arrearage is necessary to mitigate security 
concerns.  
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due 
child-support debt, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may 
well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude 
that financial consideration concerns are not mitigated.
