Decision

KATAUSKAS, Philip J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for access 
to classified information. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concern raised by his 
refusal to complete required Federal income tax forms and for his failure to satisfy seven 
state income tax liens. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted Questionnaires for National Security Positions 
(SF 86 format) on October 16, 2008, and May 5, 2016. These documents are commonly 
known as a security clearance applications. On January 17, 2018, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of 
reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information.1 It detailed the 
                                                          
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In 
2 
 
factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for 
financial considerations. Applicant answered the SOR on February 15 2018, and 
requested a decision based on the written record without a hearing.   
 
On April 12, 2018, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material  
(FORM).2 The FORM was mailed to Applicant on April 19, 2018. He was given 30 days 
to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government’s 
evidence. Applicant received the FORM on April 26, 2018. He responded to the FORM 
on May 29, 2018, and submitted one document that I have marked as Applicant’s Exhibit 
(AE). It is admitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on July 
26, 2018.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
  Included in the FORM were 13 items of evidence. Items 1 and 2 are the SOR and 
Applicant’s Answer, respectively. Because they are the pleadings, I have not marked 
them as exhibits. I have marked Items 3 through 13 as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 
through 11. GE 1 and 2 and GE 5 through 11 are admitted into evidence without objection. 
 
 GE 3 and 4 are reports of investigation (ROI) summarizing Applicant’s interviews 
that took place in February 2011 and July 2016 during background investigations. The 
ROI are not authenticated, as required under ¶ E3.1.20 of the Directive.3 Department 
Counsel’s written brief includes a footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not 
authenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the authentication 
requirement. The footnote is prominently prefaced with a bolded, upper-case notice to 
Applicant and flagging for Applicant the importance of the footnote, which then explains 
the concepts of authentication and waiver. In a case such as this, where Applicant has 
responded to the FORM, it is fair to conclude that Applicant read the footnote, understood 
it, and chose not to object to the ROI. The ROI (GE 3 and 4) are, therefore, admitted into 
evidence.4  
 
                                                          
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), 
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here. The AG were published in the Federal 
Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. § 154, Appendix H (2016).   
 
2 The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documents,  
some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision.  
 
3 See generally ISCR Case No. 12-10933 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2016) (In a concurring opinion, Judge Ra’anan 
notes the historical concern about reports of investigation in that they were considered by some to present 
a heightened problem in providing due process in security clearance cases. Judge Ra’anan raises a number 
of pertinent questions about using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.). 
 
4 This is consistent with recent Appeal Board decisions. ADP Case No. 17-03252 at 2-3 (Aug. 13, 2018) 
(ROI admitted where applicant failed to object to the ROI in his response to the FORM); ISCR Case No. 
16-03126 at 2 (Jan. 24, 2018) (ROI admitted where applicant’s response to the FORM failed to object to 
the ROI or indicate that it was inaccurate); ISCR Case No. 15-05047 at 4 (Nov. 8, 2017) (ROI admitted 
where applicant failed to object to the ROI in his response to the FORM).

Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is 36 years old, a college graduate, has never married, and has no 
children. Since September 2012, he has worked full-time for a defense contractor.5  
 
The SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated by his employer in 2008 for 
refusing to complete Federal income tax forms and that he has seven unsatisfied state 
tax liens totaling $39,712.6 Applicant admits that his failure to complete a Federal tax form 
was the reason his then employer gave for terminating him in 2008, but he claims that he 
did complete all required Federal tax forms.7 I interpret that as a denial. The record 
evidence, however, supports the SOR allegation. The December 15, 2008 termination 
letter from Applicant’s then employer stated that he was being terminated due to his 
“refusal to fully complete required forms, i.e. the Federal W-4 tax form.”8 Applicant had 
just been hired, on December 1, 2008, at a starting salary of $80,017 per year.9 Applicant 
also denied the tax liens, claimed they are “unfounded,” and that he has “repeatedly 
requested specifics (how is the obligation created . . .) . . . but [has] been met by silence 
at every turn.”10 The tax liens are, however, supported by the record.11  
 
Law and Policies 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.12 As noted 
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard 
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”13 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about 
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved 
in favor of protecting national security.

 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.14 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.15 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.16 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.17 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.18 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.19 
 
 In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a 
preponderance of evidence.20 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and 
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.21 
 
Discussion 
  
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations,22 the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information . . . .23

 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to obtain money or something else of value. It 
encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other important 
qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying  
conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
AG ¶ 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following mitigating conditions: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;  
 
AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial 
history when it comes to his state income tax obligations and those financial problems 
continue to this day. Security concerns are raised under AG ¶¶ 19(a), (b), (c), and (f).  
The next inquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. 
 
 Although the state income tax debts became delinquent as far back as 2011, they 
remain unsatisfied to this day. Moreover, the liens are as recent as 2015. AG ¶ 20(a) does 
6 
 
not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant’s failure to satisfy his state income tax 
obligations was caused by conditions largely beyond his control. Nor is there any 
evidence that he has initiated and adhered to any good-faith efforts to satisfy those tax 
obligations. Finally, there is no evidence that Applicant has made arrangements with the 
appropriate tax authority to pay off the state tax liens. Therefore, AG ¶¶ 20(b), (d), and 
(g) do not apply. No other mitigating conditions are applicable.  
 
  Applicant was terminated from his employment in December 2008 for refusing to 
fulfill one of the most rudimentary requirements expected by any employer of a new-hire 
salaried employee, that is, to complete a W-4 form. Applicant’s refusal was based on 
frivolous reasons. I find against Applicant on SOR ¶ 1.a.  
 
The record raises doubts about Applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, good 
judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I 
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed 
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person 
concept.24 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant failed to meet his ultimate burden of 
persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
     Formal Findings 
 
 As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following 
formal findings on the SOR allegations: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.h:                  Against Applicant  
 
Conclusion 
  
In light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant access to classified information.
