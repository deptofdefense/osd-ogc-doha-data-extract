LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for 
access to classified information. His background includes six incidents during 2003-
2015 in which he was arrested or charged or convicted of criminal offenses, many of 
which are relatively low-level matters (e.g. disorderly conduct). Taken together as a 
whole, as opposed to being viewed in a piecemeal fashion, the multiple incidents reflect 
a recurring pattern of poor judgment or an unwillingness to abide by rules and 
regulations or both. Although he presented a good case in reform and rehabilitation, it is 
too soon to tell if his recurring pattern is a thing of the past and that he will be a law-
abiding person in the future. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on March 13, 2009.1 This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. After completion of a background investigation, he was

granted a security clearance in about October 2009. He completed and submitted 
another security clearance application in October 2014 as part of a regular periodic 
reinvestigation.2 Thereafter, on December 21, 2016, after reviewing the application and 
the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement 
of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the 
national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is 
similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security 
guidelines known as Guideline J for criminal conduct and Guideline E for personal 
conduct, although the latter is simply a cross-allegation to the matters alleged under the 
former.     
 
Applicant, without the assistance of counsel, answered the SOR on January 29, 
2017. He admitted the allegations and provided explanations in a ten-page 
memorandum. He also requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a 
hearing. He changed his mind in August 2017 and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to another administrative judge on August 10, 2017, and 
a hearing was scheduled for September 28, 2017. The hearing was postponed at 
Applicant’s request. The case was reassigned to me on October 18, 2017. The hearing 
took place as scheduled on April 12, 2018. Applicant appeared with counsel. 
Department Counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-
7. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits A-H. 
Applicant called three character witness and presented his own testimony. The hearing 
transcript (Tr.) was received on April 24, 2018.  
 
Procedural Matters 
 
With the agreement of counsel, I took administrative or official notice that the 
state criminal statute to which Applicant pleaded guilty to, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, is a 
misdemeanor offense, not a felony offense as alleged.3 
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance 
previously granted to him. He has worked in the field of information technology since 
early 2009. He is currently employed as a web-software developer for a company in the 
defense industry. He has been so employed since mid-2015, and he currently earns an 
annual salary of about $87,000. He has a good employment record.4 His former 
program manager appeared as a witness at the hearing, and she described Applicant

as follows: (1) an average to above average employee; (2) exemplary technical 
expertise; (3) strong work ethic; (4) interacted well with others; and (5) had a positive 
attitude about work.5 In addition, three co-workers submitted highly favorable letters of 
recommendation in which they described Applicant’s attributes as a good employee as 
well as their opinions that Applicant is a trustworthy person who is suitable for continued 
access to classified information.6 
 
Applicant’s formal education includes a high school diploma awarded in 2004. He 
then attended college during 2006-2008, with the award of a bachelor’s degree in 
computer science in 2011. He married for the first time in 2012 and divorced in 2015. 
He married for the second time in 2018. He has seven minor children in his household; 
three from his first marriage; two from his current marriage; and two stepchildren.   
 
Applicant does not dispute his history of criminal activity.7 Four of the six 
incidents occurred during 2003-2006, when he was in high school or shortly thereafter 
before he left his state of residence to attend college in 2006. He disclosed the four 
incidents in his 2009 security clearance application. The last two incidents occurred in 
2010 and 2015, after the Defense Department granted him a security clearance in 2009. 
He disclosed the 2010 incident (mistakenly as 2012) in his 2014 security clearance 
application. The incidents are discussed below seriatim.  
 
The first incident occurred on October 30, 2003, when the then 17-year-old 
Applicant was charged with the misdemeanor offense of possession of marijuana.8 He 
pleaded guilty to the charge in April 2004, but the judgment of guilty was deferred for 
one year provided there were no further criminal charges and all conditions were met, 
the case would be dismissed. The conditions specified no use, possession, or 
consumption of alcohol or a controlled substance. The state court issued an order to 
show cause in August 2004 and scheduled the case for a probation violation hearing. In 
due course, he was found guilty as charged with possession of marijuana, the delay for 
the deferred sentence was revoked, and a conviction was entered. The state court 
sentenced him to pay a total of $1,010; ten days in jail; seven months of probation; and 
suspended his driver’s license for 30 days followed by restrictions for 150 days. He was 
discharged from probation ahead of schedule in October 2004.  
 
The second incident occurred on July 22, 2004, when Applicant (still a minor) 
was charged with operating a vehicle with the presence of a controlled substance.9 This 
incident was the trigger for the order-to-show-cause and probation-violation hearing 
mentioned in the previous paragraph. Several months later in June 2005, he pleaded

guilty to a reduced charge of operating a vehicle while visibly impaired. The state court 
sentenced him to a $1,000 fine; 30 hours of community service; 15 days in jail with 
credit for 1 day and 14 days suspended; continued counseling, no use, possession, or 
consumption of alcohol or controlled substances and random testing for the same; and 
12 months of probation. About three months later in September 2005, the state court 
issued an order to show cause to Applicant to show why he should not be held in 
criminal contempt of court for failure to perform community service, as ordered. That 
matter was resolved when he completed the community service in December 2005. The 
state court scheduled a probation-violation hearing in March 2006, based on charges 
brought against him in February 2006. The matter was removed from the court’s docket 
and Applicant was discharged from probation in April 2006.  
 
The third incident occurred on August 31, 2004, when Applicant (a few months 
shy of his 18th birthday in October) was charged with the offense of minor in possession 
of alcohol.10 The charge was dismissed in September 2004 without a finding of guilt or a 
sentence.  
 
The fourth incident occurred on February 10, 2006, when the then 19-year-old 
Applicant was charged with (1) assaulting, resisting, or obstructing a police officer, and 
(2) possession of a controlled substance, second offense, a felony-level offense.11 The 
former charge was dismissed and the latter charge was reduced to a misdemeanor 
offense of possession of a controlled substance (marijuana) in April 2006.12 The state 
court sentenced him to a $1,500 fine; 365 days in jail with credit for 1 day served and 
364 days suspended; 90-day tether; 18 months of probation; random drug and alcohol 
testing; no use, possession, or consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs; suspension of 
his driver’s license for 30 days followed by restrictions for 150 days; and weekly testing 
for the presence of THC (the active ingredient in marijuana). In August 2006, the state 
court gave him permission to move to another state to enroll in college and study 
computer science. He began his college studies in October 2006, and he was formally 
discharged from probation in November 2006. He had no drug- or alcohol-related 
incidents in his college years during 2006-2008, and he has had no such incidents since 
beginning employment in 2009. 
 
The fifth incident occurred on March 31, 2010, when the then 23-year-old 
Applicant was cited for disorderly conduct and released.13 The statement he provided 
his company’s security office was different than what is reported in the police report. 
Applicant was in a confrontation with a person who accused him of assault after 
Applicant intervened and attempted to break up a previous confrontation in a store 
parking lot between the person and another individual. The matter was dismissed 
without a conviction after Applicant completed an anger-management program.

11 Exhibit A at 13-18.  
 
12 Exhibits F and H; Appellate Exhibit I.  
 
13 Exhibit 4.

The sixth incident occurred on April 19, 2015, when the then 28-year-old 
Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct/domestic violence stemming from an 
argument with his then wife.14 The incident took place the day before Applicant and his 
then wife separated in light of the pending divorce later that year. He was served with a 
protection order while in jail and released. The matter was dismissed without a 
conviction after he completed a two-day anger-management program. 
 
Concerning the last two incidents, Applicant concedes that he “really messed 
up.”15 He stated that he got caught up in situations where emotions were running high 
and he put himself in positions where he was cited and arrested by the police. He 
believes additional charges of disorderly conduct are highly unlikely, because he has 
learned his lesson.16 
 
Besides the former program manager, Applicant presented two witnesses, both 
older men with military experience, who are involved with Applicant through their church 
membership. The first witness served as Applicant’s instructor in the church’s 20 to 22 
week discipleship training course, which Applicant completed in May 2012.17 He stated 
that Applicant had been saved, that he was a faithful attendee of church services, and 
that he was a trustworthy, reliable, and truthful person. The witness saw a change in 
Applicant in that he was easy to get along with, not easy to upset, and in better control 
of his life.18 The second witness, a deacon in the church, worked extensively with 
Applicant during a church construction project. He stated that he found Applicant to be a 
reliable and trustworthy person who was also a loving father. In addition, Applicant 
presented highly favorable letters of recommendation from a police officer from 
Applicant’s home town, his father, and a former employer from his home town.19 
 
Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.20

It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.21 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”22 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.23 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.24 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.25 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.26 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.27 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.28 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.29 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.30 
 
Discussion 
 
 The criminal conduct and personal conduct concerns are discussed together 
because they are based on the same set of facts and circumstances.31 In analyzing this

‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no 
right to a security clearance).

case, I considered the following disqualifying and mitigating conditions as most pertinent 
under Guidelines J and E, respectively: 
 
AG ¶ 31(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would 
be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in 
combination cast doubt on the individual’s judgment, reliability, or 
trustworthiness;  
 
AG ¶ 31(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;  
 
AG ¶ 31(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to 
complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program;   
 
AG ¶ 32(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior 
happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not 
limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, 
restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or 
higher education, good employment record, or constructive community 
involvement;  
 
AG ¶ 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue 
areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other 
single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a 
whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, 
unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and 
regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not 
properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  
 
AG ¶ 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the 
behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique 
circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
 Applicant’s background includes six incidents during 2003-2015 in which he was 
arrested or charged or convicted of criminal offenses, many of which are relatively low-
level matters (e.g. disorderly conduct). Taken together as a whole, as opposed to being 
viewed in a piecemeal fashion, the multiple incidents reflect a recurring pattern of poor 
judgment or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations or both. It is noteworthy 
that the four incidents during 2003-2006 were considered in 2009, when the Defense 
Department determined that Applicant was then an acceptable security risk. 
Subsequently, he was involved in two additional incidents of criminal activity, the first in 
 
8 
 
2010 and the second in 2015. Both occurred when Applicant was in his 20s with a full-
time job as a cleared employee in the defense industry. He promptly reported both 
incidents. Neither was particularly serious nor resulted in a conviction. But taken 
together with the four previous incidents, I am left with substantial doubt about whether 
Applicant can stay out of trouble. The frequency and recency of the incidents give me 
pause. The trend line, six run-ins with the law during a 12-year-period, is not in 
Applicant’s favor.  
 
 Applicant’s history of criminal activity reflects a pattern of poor judgment or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations or both. Although he presented a good 
case in reform and rehabilitation—for example, his extensive involvement in his 
church—it is too soon to tell if his recurring pattern is a thing of the past and that he will 
be a law-abiding person in the future. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the 
evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the 
unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. 
Nevertheless, I conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show 
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to 
classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant  
  Subparagraphs 1.a -1.d:   Against Applicant 
  Subparagraph 1.e:    For Applicant32 
  Subparagraphs 1.f -1.g:   Against Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
 It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to 
classified information.

32 As far as I can determine, Applicant was involved in six not seven incidents, as alleged in the SOR. The 
matters in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e concern the same incident, and so this duplication is resolved in 
Applicant’s favor.
