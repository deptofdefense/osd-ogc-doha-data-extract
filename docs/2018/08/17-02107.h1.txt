MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 25, 2015. On 
June 27, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 
1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by 
the DOD on June 8, 2017. 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on August 18, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The Government was ready to proceed on October 2, 
2017, and the case was assigned to me on March 15, 2018. On April 13, 2018, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for May 16, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled.

Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted into evidence, without 
objection. I appended to the record correspondence the Government sent to Applicant 
as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, and the Government’s exhibit list as HE II. At the hearing, 
Applicant testified and did not present any documents for admission into the record. At 
Applicant’s request, I left the record open until June 13, 2018. Applicant provided 
additional documents that were admitted into evidence as AE A, without objection. 
DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
Applicant, age 34, has never married. He has an 11-year-old child. He was one 
credit short of earning a bachelor’s degree after having attended four years of college. 
This is his first application for a security clearance. He is awaiting a security guard 
position with a defense contractor (Defense Contractor A) that is contingent on a 
favorable resolution.2 
 
Applicant admitted each of the 10 delinquent debts, totaling $22,445, alleged in 
the SOR. Applicant underwent training with Defense Contractor A for three weeks in 
May 2015, during which time he earned $10 per hour and worked 40 hours per week. In 
June 2015, he used that income to make some payments towards his delinquent 
debts.3 He has not otherwise had the funds to pay them. The post-hearing status of 
each alleged debt is set forth in the following table: 
 
SOR ¶ Description Status 
1.a/$11,452 
(auto loan 
account).4 
Applicant financed a 2007 used sedan in May 2011. Its 
transmission broke 10 miles outside of warranty, at 
which time he was unemployed but current with his 
payments. He surrendered the vehicle because he 
could not afford the repair. He paid $53 in June 2015. 
He claimed, without corroborating documents, that the 
creditor told him he owed a $0 balance. 
No plans to 
pay.  
 
1.b/$3,452 
(auto loan 
account).5 
 
Applicant financed a 2009 used sedan in Sept. 2012. In 
Nov. or Dec. 2013, a drunk driver totaled it. The driver’s 
insurance did not pay full balance owed. He claimed, 
without corroborating documents, that the creditor told 
him he owed a $0 balance. 
No plans to 
pay.

1.j/$160 
(unpaid 
traffic 
tickets).13 
A person that Applicant allowed to use his car received 
traffic tickets. No payments made. 
Plans to pay. 
 
Applicant does not have a formal or court-ordered arrangement for the custody or 
support of his child. Informally, the child’s mother has agreed to give Applicant liberal 
visitation rights and to accept $300 per month for child support. Applicant has made 
those monthly child-support payments to the mother since the child was born.14 
 
In May 2017, Applicant had been residing with his father when a search warrant 
(involving his father only) was executed in the home. Applicant was not home at the 
time of the search. He returned to the home immediately upon learning from a neighbor 
about the search. Upon his return, he discovered that “everything” in the home had 
been destroyed during the search. Applicant was only able to salvage a few clothes and 
“things of that nature,” and lost “a lot” of the documentation relevant to the SOR debts.15  
 
Applicant was previously employed as a security guard by a defense contractor 
from June 2010 through February 2013, when his contract ended. He was unemployed 
for approximately six months until September 2013 when he was hired for a part-time 
retail position that ended in April 2017 because the retailer went out of business. He 
earned a bi-weekly salary of approximately $1,300 for the security-guard position, and 
approximately $500 bi-weekly for the retail position. From his two current part-time 
positions, he earns approximately $400 weekly for his “night job” (started in May 2017), 
and $500 bi-weekly for his “day job” (started in September 2017).16 
 
Applicant began to experience financial problems after his contract position 
ended in February 2013. While he received a “couple hundred dollars” of unemployment 
compensation, it did not suffice to meet his expenses. Despite his best efforts to try to 
find “any type of work,” he has not yet been able to secure gainful employment. 
Applicant expects to earn $33 to $35 per hour for his pending full-time security guard 
position, which will provide him with the income necessary to address his delinquent 
debts. If he is unsuccessful in obtaining a security clearance, he plans to pay his 
delinquent debts using a combination of his salary and his mother’s help.17 
 
Applicant has not sought financial counseling. However, he utilizes a budget to 
manage his finances, and a web application to monitor his credit. In order to live within

the means of his limited income, Applicant reduced all of his expenses and works two 
part-time jobs (totaling approximately 70 hours per week). He moved in, for a time, with 
his father, for which he did not pay rent and had minimal expenses. He now lives with 
his mother and niece. His mother had been unemployed for a year until approximately 
February 2018 (during which time Applicant financially supported her), when she began 
contributing to the household expenses (approximately $1,000 per month) and helping 
Applicant “catch back up with things.” He is managing his current expenses responsibly 
and has not accumulated any new delinquent debts.18  
 
Applicant is anxious to return to security guard work because it gives him a 
chance to be able to “do something” and “accomplish something.” The niece (age three) 
with whom he and his mother live is the daughter of Applicant’s sister who passed away 
in November 2017. Applicant has taken an active role in her daily care and shares the 
“primary caregiver” role with his mother.19 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”20 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”21 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”22 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible

extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”23 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.24 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”25 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.26 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.27 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.28 
 
  An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”29 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”30 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise

questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s delinquent debts, which are corroborated by his admissions and 
credit reports, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) 
(inability to satisfy debts) and AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). 
 
 None of the following potentially applicable factors have been fully established to 
mitigate the concerns raised under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20 (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
Applicant’s financial indebtedness is largely attributed to circumstances beyond 
his control. While he is credited with initiating action to resolve his debts in 2015 when 
he had the means to do so, he has not made any progress since then. Because he did 
not provide corroborating documentation, I cannot conclude that the debts alleged in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.h, and 1.i have been resolved. Applicant articulated a reasonable 
basis to dispute the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i, but not SOR ¶ 1.h. He did not provide 
 
8 
 
documentary proof to substantiate the basis of either dispute or sufficient evidence of 
actions to resolve the dispute as to either debt. 
 
Applicant has done a commendable job trying to address his financial 
indebtedness by making some payments as soon as he had the means to do so, taking 
on extra jobs, and reducing his expenses. I have considered the fact that he is not 
required to be debt-free in order to qualify for a security clearance.31 Unfortunately, the 
promise of gainful employment is not sufficient mitigation on its own. While Applicant’s 
plan to repay his debts rested primarily on his pending security guard position, he also 
articulated a reasonable alternative plan to repay his debts through a combination of his 
current part-time salary and his mother’s help. While he may very well be successful 
with that plan, without a demonstrated track record of consistent payments, it is too 
soon to conclude that his finances are under control and not likely to recur. However 
sincere, promises to pay debts cannot alone suffice to establish mitigation. Therefore, I 
cannot find that Applicant has met his burden to overcome the Guideline F concerns at 
this time. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
adjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole 
person. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors 
listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the 
context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security 
concerns raised by his financial indebtedness. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his 
burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him 
eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
                                                          
31 ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (An applicant does not have to be debt-free in 
order to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly 
given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by “concomitant 
conduct” that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan).

Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.j: Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant 
Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied.
