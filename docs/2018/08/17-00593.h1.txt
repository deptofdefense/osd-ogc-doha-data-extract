GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for 
access to classified information is granted.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On March 24, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.1 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on April 18, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 15, 2018. The 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 
                                                          
1 I also considered this case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my 
conclusions are the same using either set of AG.

29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for April 18, 2018. I convened the hearing as 
scheduled. 
  
The Government’s exhibit list and discovery letter were appended to the record 
as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted 
in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) 
A through E, which were admitted in evidence without objection.  
 
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until May 16, 2018. He timely provided additional documentation, which I 
marked as AE F and G and admitted in evidence without objection. I appended to the 
record as HE III emails from Department Counsel indicating she did not have any 
objection to AE F and G. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 8, 2018.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c 
through 1.g. He is 42 years old. He was born in Africa, he immigrated to the United 
States in 2000, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. He married in 
November 2006 and separated in July 2012. He filed for divorce in 2016, but it was not 
finalized as of the date of the hearing. He has four children. His two eldest children, 
ages 17 and 14, are from previous relationships. His two youngest children, ages 11 
and 9, are from his marriage. Since 2015, his eldest child has lived with him in state A.2 
 
 Applicant graduated from high school in 1996 in Africa and obtained an auto 
mechanics certification in 2001 in the United States. He served in the U.S. military from 
2004 until his honorable discharge in 2010. He was twice deployed. As of the hearing 
date, he was attending college and expected to earn a bachelor’s degree in cyber 
security in 2019. Since June 2015, he has worked as a security guard for his current 
employer, a defense contractor. He was first granted a DOD security clearance when he 
was in the U.S. military. He has held an interim security clearance since 2015.3 
 
 The SOR alleges a May 2012 state tax lien of $1,356 (SOR ¶ 1.f), two delinquent 
child support accounts totaling $32,895 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b), and four delinquent 
consumer debts for $2,292 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g). The SOR allegations are 
established by Applicant’s admissions and credit reports from July 2015, April 2016, and 
January 2017. Applicant also listed some of his delinquent debts in his May 2015 
security clearance application (SCA).4  
 
 Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to his limited income while he was in the 
U.S. military, as well as to periods of unemployment after his 2010 military discharge. 
He was unemployed in state B from October 2010 to April 2012. He was unemployed in

state C from February through June 2013. He was unemployed in state A from October 
2014 to October 2015. His wife’s work as a massage therapist, and his receipt of 
unemployment benefits and money from the GI Bill while attending school, was 
insufficient to overcome their financial troubles. Marital strife followed.5 
 
 During his first period of unemployment, Applicant’s wife elected to move with 
their two children from state B to state C, where her mother resided, in around 2011. He 
followed three to four months later. With state C’s assistance for military veterans, he 
obtained a commercial driver’s license in 2012 and worked as a tractor trailer driver. 
When he became unemployed again, he elected to move to state A in June 2013 so 
that he could alleviate his financial troubles by living with his sister. He obtained work 
briefly, but became unemployed for a third time.6  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are for delinquent child support totaling $32,265. SOR ¶ 1.a 
is for $18,971 in delinquent child support to county 1 in state B for Applicant’s second 
child. SOR ¶ 1.b is for $13,924 in delinquent child support to county 2 in state B for his 
two youngest children. Applicant was first ordered to pay child support in 2004, in the 
amount of $200 monthly for his eldest child. Due to his limited income, based on his 
rank in the U.S. military, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) 
garnished only $120 monthly. He testified that he neither had any child-support 
obligation nor any child-support arrears for his eldest child, as the child had been living 
with him since 2015.7   
 
 In 2005, Applicant was ordered to pay a second child-support obligation of $300 
monthly, for his second child. DFAS garnished only $150 monthly, for the reason 
previously discussed. In 2013, he was ordered to pay a third child-support obligation, of 
$300 monthly for his two youngest children. From 2005 to 2015, Applicant’s wages were 
only garnished for $150 to $270 monthly, when he was court-ordered to pay between 
$500 and $800 monthly in child support. He believed that DFAS would ultimately 
garnish the full court-ordered amount. He also understood that his tax refunds since 
2007 were intercepted and applied towards his child-support obligation.8 
 
 Applicant did not learn that he was in arrears until after his 2010 military 
discharge, when he was told that state B placed a hold on his 2011 passport application 
due to an $8,000 child-support arrearage. He had not previously received notices of any 
such arrears. Once he received notice, he entered into a payment plan of $40 monthly 
for the arrearage in SOR ¶ 1.a. He continued this payment plan until 2015, when he 
stopped for a period because of his limited income. When he began working for his 
current company in June 2015, he earned more money. He requested an increase in 
the garnishment of his wages for his child-support obligation, from $150 to $300

monthly. He understood that this amount was applied towards his monthly child-support 
obligation as well as his arrearages in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.9 
 
 In March 2017, Applicant’s wages were garnished for $350 monthly, with a year-
to-date total of $2,452. He increased the amount from $300 to $350 monthly because 
he wanted to apply more money towards his arrearages. He provided three paystubs, 
one from June 2017 and two from November 2017, reflecting that he had two child 
support deductions in place. The first deduction was a continuation of the existing $350 
monthly, with a year-to-date total of $8,407 as of November 24, 2017. The second 
deduction began in around May 2017, for $262 monthly, with a year-to-date total of 
$3,675 as of November 24, 2017.10  
 
 Since March 2017, Applicant made several attempts to telephone the individuals 
in charge of his child-support cases. He wanted to explore alternative arrangements to 
resolve his arrearages. He had not made any progress in that regard as of the date of 
the hearing. He hired a law firm in late 2017 for $50 monthly to assist him with 
continuing to resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.11 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c is for an auto account that was $294 past due. Applicant brought the 
account current in April 2017, and he paid it in full in January 2018. He no longer had 
any car payments as of the date of the hearing.12 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.d is for Applicant’s wife’s phone account in his name, in collection for 
$985. She refused to pay it after they separated. Applicant made a payment in April 
2017 payment for $121, and the balance was $863. He testified that he settled this debt 
in that same month for $483, to be paid in four monthly installments of $120. He testified 
that he made the installment payments as agreed and he paid this debt. He intended to 
provide documentation to corroborate his claim.13  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e is for a $681 charged-off debt to the federal government. Applicant 
was overpaid while he was in the military. He testified that he resolved this debt in 2017 
through a garnishment of his disability pay.14  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f is for a $1,356 state tax lien from May 2012. Applicant’s tax preparer 
prepared his 2011 federal and state income tax returns, and filed his 2011 federal 
returns but failed to file his 2011 state returns. He testified that he filed his 2011 state

tax return. He satisfied the lien in January 2016, prior to the SOR. He testified that he 
was current on all his tax filings and he had no outstanding taxes.15 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g is for an internet account in collection for $332. Applicant testified that 
he initially disputed this debt on his credit reports. He then settled it for $150 and paid it 
in April 2017. It was no longer reported on his most recent credit report from 2017.16  
 
 Applicant received financial counseling from the U.S. Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) as well as from the law firm that he hired in late 2017. He had a budget. He 
earned around $3,000 monthly. As he has had a 50% to 60% disability rating from the 
VA since 2013, he also receives $850 monthly in disability pay. He is able to pay his 
debts, and he had a monthly net remainder of between $700 and $800. The law firm 
was also assisting him with disputing certain debts on his credit report. He has the 
financial means to resolve the remaining delinquent debts in the SOR, and he intends to 
do so. He does not have additional delinquent debts.17 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.

17 Tr. at 10, 33-34, 68-72, 81-83, 85-88; AE A. 
 
6 
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay his debts, to include his 2012 tax lien. The evidence 
is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(b), and 19(f) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
 
7 
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; and 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 Applicant’s financial problems stemmed from his limited income while he was in 
the U.S. military and his three periods of unemployment after his 2010 military 
discharge. He has acted responsibly in addressing them. He paid SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, and 
1.g. His payment of SOR ¶ 1.f occurred before the SOR. He testified that he paid SOR 
¶¶ 1.d. and 1.e.  
 
 Applicant was in the process of resolving SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. He mistakenly 
believed that DFAS would ultimately garnish the full amount of his child-support 
obligations. His limited income, however, prevented DFAS from doing so beginning with 
his first child support order in 2004. Since 2007, his tax refunds were intercepted and 
applied towards his outstanding child-support obligation. Once he learned about his 
arrearage in 2011 and through 2015, he entered into a $40 monthly payment plan. 
When he began earning more money in June 2015, he increased the garnishment of his 
wages for his child-support obligation and his arrearages from $150 to the $300 
monthly. In March 2017, he again increased his wage garnishment, to $350 monthly, so 
that more money could be applied towards his arrearages. As of November 2017, he 
had two child support deductions in place: one for $350 monthly and one for $262 
monthly. Through such deductions, he paid a total of $12,082 towards his outstanding 
child-support debts. He had been telephoning the individuals from the respective child 
support agencies since March 2017 to work on alternative arrangements to resolve the 
arrearages. He had also been working with the law firm since late 2017 to assist him 
with continuing to resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. 
  
  A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. ISCR Case No. 09-
 
8 
 
02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an 
individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged 
in the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she 
need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to 
implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). 
Applicant has not incurred additional delinquent debts. While he has unresolved SOR 
debts remaining, he has demonstrated a good-faith effort and he has the means to 
continue to resolve them. They do not cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and judgment AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are applicable.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant’s honorable military 
service, to include his two deployments. He has taken responsible action to resolve his 
debts. While he has unresolved SOR debts remaining, he credibly testified at hearing 
and there is sufficient evidence to show that he is committed to resolving them.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant 
mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.g:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
