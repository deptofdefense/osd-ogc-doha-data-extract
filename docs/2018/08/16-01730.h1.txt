GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns involving drug involvement and 
substance misuse, criminal conduct, financial considerations, and personal conduct. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On November 17, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement 
of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H (drug 
involvement and substance misuse), J (criminal conduct), F (financial considerations), 
and E (personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 
10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as 
amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative 
guidelines (AG).1 
                                                     
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG.

Applicant responded to the SOR on January 31, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2017. 
The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing (NOH) 
on November 28, 2017, scheduling the hearing for January 11, 2018. Without objection, 
I granted Applicant’s request for a continuance, for additional time to prepare. DOHA 
issued a second NOH on January 4, 2018, scheduling the hearing for February 26, 
2018. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. 
 
I marked the Government’s discovery letter and list of exhibits as Hearing 
Exhibits (HE) I and II. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 19 were admitted in 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified, called one witness, and submitted 
Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted in evidence without 
objection.                                                                                                                                                  
  
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until March 12, 2018, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. 
Without objection, I granted Applicant’s March 5, 2018, request for an extension of time 
and left the record open until April 13, 2018. Applicant did not provide any additional 
evidence. I marked collectively as HE III, Applicant’s requests to cancel the initially 
scheduled hearing and for an extension of time to submit additional documentation. 
DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 12, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In response to the SOR, Applicant confirmed the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 
1.f, 1.g, and 4.a. I construed her confirmation of these allegations as admissions. She 
neither admitted nor denied the remaining SOR allegations. I construed her lack of a 
specific admission or denial to these allegations as denials.2  
 
 Applicant is 52 years old. She married in 1987 and divorced in 2002. After her 
divorce, she reconciled with her ex-husband three times: in 2004 for 10 months, at the 
end of 2005 until 2007, and from 2009 until his passing in February 2013. She has a 22-
year-old child, who was living with and financially supported by her until September 
2017.3  
 
 Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 1996 and a master’s degree in 2014. 
She recently completed a certified professional contract manager course, and she was 
studying for the exam as of the hearing date. Since around 1985, she has worked for 
various defense contractors. Between 1985 and 2009, she received yearly exceptional 
inspection ratings for security compliance from the DOD as the facility security officer 
(FSO) for two defense contractors. She has worked as a senior contracts manager for

her current defense contractor since August 2014. She was first granted a DOD security 
clearance in 1985.4  
 
 Applicant acknowledged that she struggled with an opioid addiction for 
approximately 17 years, from 1996 to 2013. She attributed her drug-related arrests and 
charges, and her delinquent finances, in part to her opioid addiction. She was first 
prescribed opiates by a pain specialist in 1996, when opioids were considered safe, for 
chronic pain from a car accident injury. The doctor maintained her prescription regimen 
of opioids daily, with increasing doses monthly, until he lost his license in around 2002. 
She believed this regimen led to her addiction.5  
 
 From 2002 to 2008, Applicant saw another doctor who continued to prescribe her 
opioids and other pain medications. During this period, she tried many times to stop 
using opioids but she would become ill and incapable of functioning, so her doctor 
resumed her opioid medication. From 2008 to February 2013, she saw her primary care 
physician for the purpose of pain medication management and weaning her off opioids. 
He prescribed her lower doses of opioids. In February 2013, after her ex-husband’s 
death and another drug-related arrest and conviction, she stopped using opioids cold 
turkey.6  
 
 Applicant identified several factors that contributed to her drug-related arrests 
and charges, and delinquent finances, including: abuse by her ex-husband; her ex-
husband’s alcoholism; her ex-husband’s illness; and her ex-husband’s family. When he 
was diagnosed with end stage renal failure in 2010 after attempting to cease his alcohol 
consumption, he required dialysis and round-the clock care.  Applicant quit her job to 
take care of him. She reconciled with him despite the abuse because his family had 
deserted him. She also did so for the sake of their daughter. She denied that her 
reconciliation with him had anything to do with having access to his prescription 
medications.7  
 
 Applicant’s finances also suffered when she worked as a consultant from mid-
2009 to mid-2012, and her income was unsteady due to the nature of consulting work. 
For 11 months during this period, she did not receive income and she was financially 
supported by her mother. When her ex-husband required dialysis in approximately late 
2011, they received no income for a period as he had not yet been approved for 
disability pay. While she has been steadily employed since August 2012, she financially 
supported her child until September 2017. Her five-hour commute between work and 
home also contributed to her delinquent finances.8

 In May 2009, Applicant was charged with three counts of controlled dangerous 
substance (CDS): possession - not marijuana, and driving vehicle while impaired by 
drugs or alcohol, or alcohol and drugs (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 2.a, 3.b). She was pulled over for 
speeding during a three and a half hour drive home, after she had stayed up all night 
talking with a long lost friend. When she attempted to obtain something from her purse, 
she dropped some pills onto the passenger seat. She was subsequently administered 
field sobriety tests, which she indicated she had difficulty performing due to her neck 
problems and bad balance.9 
 
 The CDS charges were dropped after she produced her prescriptions for the 
various medications she had on her at the time of her arrest. She pled guilty to the latter 
charge. She was sentenced to probation before judgment. She performed 40 hours of 
community service, paid a fine, obtained a drug and alcohol assessment, in which she 
stated she was not found to have a substance abuse problem, and went to Narcotics 
Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). She found that the 12-step groups 
with NA and AA were similar to one another and helpful.10 
 
 On the morning of December 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with 
driving while impaired by drugs or drugs and alcohol (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 2.a, 3.b). She testified 
that prior to her arrest, she had taken her prescription medication as prescribed. She 
was pulled over on her drive into work. She was convicted, sentenced to 60 days of 
which 56 were suspended, and placed on one year of probation. She served two 
weekends in jail.11  
 
 Later that evening, Applicant was again arrested (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 2.a, 3.b). She was 
with her ex-husband’s close friend, and they were pulled over on the side of the road 
meeting with another car, to collect money from an acquaintance who owed her ex-
husband. The acquaintance was a known drug dealer in the neighborhood. A police 
officer stopped behind them after the acquaintance’s girlfriend gave Applicant $20 of 
crack cocaine instead of money. She was charged with CDS: possession - not 
marijuana (crack cocaine). She pled guilty and was placed on 18 months of probation.12  
 
 Applicant testified that she realized she had a problem after her two arrests in 
2010, so she voluntarily returned to the treatment center that conducted her 2009 drug 
assessment. She disclosed to the center that she had used marijuana between 2003 
and 2007 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.b), cocaine between 2009 and 2011 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 2.a, 
3.b), and misused her pain medication on various occasions in the years prior (SOR ¶¶ 
1.c, 2.a, 3.b). The center diagnosed her with opiate and cocaine dependence, as well as 
anxiolytic dependence. The center recommended that she seek outpatient treatment.

Applicant elected to go through the 12-step program because it was more affordable for 
her.13 
 
 On February 14, 2013, Applicant found her ex-husband dead in their bedroom 
when she arrived at home after work that day. She believed he died of a prescription pill 
overdose, as there were pills all over their bedroom floor. One week later, she was 
arrested and charged with CDS: possession – not marijuana, and CDS: obtain by fraud 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 2.a, 3.b). At the time of her arrest, both she and her ex-husband were 
treated by the same doctor, and had both been prescribed opioid medication. When she 
needed a refill of her medication, she could not get an appointment with the doctor. She 
testified that the doctor told her over the telephone to pick up her ex-husband’s 
prescription from the pharmacy, then follow up with him later.14  
  
 Following her doctor’s instructions, Applicant testified that she then called the 
pharmacy to have them fill her deceased ex-husband’s prescription. When she went to 
the pharmacy to pick up the prescription, the pharmacist knew from a newspaper that 
her ex-husband had died a week earlier and felt Applicant was fraudulently trying to 
take a deceased person’s prescription. Applicant was stopped in the parking lot, and 
various prescription drugs were found on her, to include one for which she had never 
been prescribed. Applicant testified that these were the drugs she found on her 
bedroom floor the week prior, when she found her ex-husband dead. She testified that 
she kept the drugs with the intention of finding out what they were then disposing of 
them. She stated that she had no intention to use them.15 
 
 Applicant pled guilty to the charge of CDS: obtain by fraud. She was placed on 
two years of probation and ordered to receive treatment. She successfully completed 
probation in November 2015. As she could not afford treatment at a state-run facility, 
she elected to participate in the 12-step program of NA, where she got a sponsor. She 
also participated in Al-Anon.16 
 
 Applicant acknowledged at hearing that she used marijuana in high school (SOR 
¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.b). She also acknowledged that she used Phencyclidine (PCP) in around 
1985, and she was with her ex-husband who had drugs in his car when she was 
charged with possession with intent PCP and possession of PCP (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 
3.b). She believed the charge was dropped and subsequently expunged. She testified 
that her October 2005 charge for second degree assault was falsely brought against her 
by her ex-husband (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 3.a). He had been drinking, and they got into an 
argument after he left their then-nine-year-old child in the car unattended. He hit her, 
and she reacted in self-defense. The charge was subsequently dropped.17

 After her ex-husband’s passing in February 2013 and her subsequent drug-
related arrest and conviction, Applicant testified that she turned her life around. Since 
then, she testified that she has been opiate-free, medication-free, drug and substance 
use-free, and alcohol-free. She indicated that she has no desire to use such 
substances, and she intends to remain abstinent from them in the future. She testified 
that she no longer socialized with her past drug-associates, or her ex-husband’s family. 
She was willing to sign a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and 
substance misuse, but had not done so as of the close of the record.18 
 
 Applicant adopted non-medicinal ways of dealing with her chronic pain, to include 
regular exercise, yoga, online support groups, online participation weekly or in-person 
participation two to five days weekly in the NA and AA 12-step programs, as well as in 
Al-Anon. She continued to have a sponsor as of the date of the hearing. She was 
writing a book about opioid addiction, to spread awareness about the dangers of using 
opioids for the treatment of chronic pain, but also as a self-reminder to remain abstinent. 
She threw herself into her career. She regularly contributed to professional networking 
groups concerning ethics, contracts, and leadership. She was also involved with an 
online leadership program.19  
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant filed chapter 7 bankruptcy and received a 
discharge in 2002 (¶¶ 2.a, 4.a). It alleges two state tax liens from 2014 for $7,668 and 
$401 (¶¶ 2.a, 4.b, 4.w), 13 delinquent consumer accounts totaling $8,710 (¶¶ 2.a, 4.c - 
4.i, 4.q, 4.x - 4.z, 4.bb - 4.cc), and 16 delinquent medical accounts totaling $2,823 (¶¶ 
2.a, 4.j - 4.p, 4.r - 4.v, 4.aa, 4.dd - 4.ff). Applicant provided a list of her outstanding 
debts, totaling $58,203, which included some of the delinquent debts alleged in the 
SOR as well some that were not. In addition to her admissions, the financial SOR 
allegations are established by bankruptcy court records from 2002; credit reports from 
May 2010, April 2015, July 2015, and March 2016; and a judgment and lien court record 
from July 2016.20 
 
 Applicant testified that her priority has been to resolve her outstanding federal 
and state taxes (SOR ¶¶ 4.b, 4.w). She indicated that she paid the IRS $2,900 of her 
outstanding $3,400 taxes. The outstanding federal tax stemmed from an error on her 
2010 and 2011 federal income tax returns, in which she did not submit proper 
documentation regarding an early withdrawal she made from her retirement savings. 
She testified that she was working with the IRS on a monthly payment plan to resolve 
the remaining $500 balance. She was unaware of any other outstanding federal taxes.21 
 
 Applicant also indicated that she decreased her outstanding state taxes from 
$7,500 to $5,900, which stemmed from the same error in her 2010 and 2011 state

income tax returns. She indicated that she made payments of $100 monthly since 
January 2017, and her 2017 state tax refund was also intercepted and applied to her 
outstanding taxes. She testified that she was in regular contact with both the IRS and 
state authority concerning her outstanding taxes. She did not provide documentation to 
corroborate her claims.22    
 
 Applicant’s next largest outstanding debt is SOR ¶ 4.c, which is a car loan 
charged off for $4,007. Applicant co-signed on the loan with her now deceased ex-
husband. It became delinquent when he got sick and she stopped working. She 
attempted to make some payments towards the loan, but the car was eventually 
repossessed. She was working with the credit-repair service, as further discussed 
below, to determine whether she should pay this debt or allow it to remain as a charge 
off.23 
 
 SOR ¶ 4.h is a credit card placed for collection for $785. Applicant testified that 
she received a settlement offer of $385 from the creditor one week prior to the date of 
the hearing. She intended to pay this settlement in full once she received her tax 
refund.24 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 4.j to 4.p, 4.r to 4.v, 4.aa, and 4.dd to 4.ff are for 16 delinquent medical 
debts totaling $2,823, though Applicant believed some were duplicates. She testified 
that she contacted her insurance company and at her request, received documentation 
demonstrating that the outstanding debts were covered by her insurance and therefore 
paid. The credit-repair service was assisting her with locating the medical creditors so 
that she could provide them with such documentation. She indicated that she was 
willing to pay her medical creditors if they could prove that the debts were not covered 
by her insurance.25 
 
 SOR ¶ 4.x is a store credit card charged off for $1,022. Having learned to do so 
from the credit-repair service through which she was receiving financial counseling, as 
further discussed below, Applicant testified that she requested a settlement from the 
creditor despite the charge off. Similar to SOR ¶ 4.x, Applicant testified that she also 
requested settlements from her remaining creditors. She hoped to resolve SOR ¶ 4.x 
and her remaining outstanding debts through such settlement arrangements.26 
 
 Applicant indicated that she paid SOR ¶ 4.q. She did not provide documentation 
to corroborate her claim. She also indicated that she was current on her student loans

totaling $53,000 that were previously deferred, through a payment plan she reached 
with the creditor.27 
 
 Applicant testified that she enrolled in a credit-repair service, offered by the 
creditor that holds her car loan, in March 2016. The service provided her with financial 
counseling, to include assistance with timely paying her bills, and resources for 
budgeting and debt management. She learned how to make a budget. The service 
assisted her with setting up payment plans for her delinquent debts as she is able. The 
service notifies her of any changes to her credit score. The service assisted her with 
identifying ways in which she can decrease her expenses, to include locating a cheaper 
place to live. The service began assisting her in October 2017 with locating some of her 
debts. She had not disputed any debts through the service as of the date of the 
hearing.28  
  
 Since August 2014, Applicant has earned $93,000 annually. She eliminated her 
internet, cable, and television services, to free up additional money to apply towards her 
debts. After paying her monthly expenses, to include her outstanding taxes as 
discussed above, rent, car payments, utilities, groceries, gas, credit card, student loans, 
personal loan, and medical fees, her monthly net remainder was $5. She hoped to 
receive a pay raise within the year. Once she moved, she expected to use any extra 
money to pay her outstanding debts. She was also working to lower her monthly student 
loan payment.29 
 
  Applicant testified that she did not falsify her April 2010 security clearance 
application (SCA), by failing to disclose her use of marijuana from 2004 to 2007, her 
misuse of prescription medication from 2003 to 2010, and her use of cocaine from 2009 
to 2010, in response to section 23a., which inquired about illegal drug use or drug 
activity in the seven years prior to the date of the SCA (SOR ¶ 2.b). She testified that 
she did not falsify information during a May 2010 background interview, when she 
stated that she had never used illegal drugs (SOR ¶ 2.c).30 
 
 Applicant testified that she failed to list her drug use on her 2010 SCA, and 
disclose her drug use during her May 2010 background interview, because of a 
combination of factors. First, it was an oversight. Second, she misread and was 
confused by the questions on her SCA. Third, she did not recall her drug use, as she 
did not have her documentation, such as her journals, to refresh her memory. She 
testified that “2010 was a very bad time for me. I honestly don’t think I was thinking 
clearly.”31

 Applicant also testified that she did not falsify her March 2015 SCA, by failing to 
disclose her use of cocaine from 2009 to 2011, and her misuse of prescription 
medication from 2008 to 2011, in response to section 23, which inquired about illegal 
drug use or drug activity, to include the misuse of prescription drugs, in the seven years 
prior to the date of the SCA (SOR ¶¶ 2.d, 2.e). She also testified that she did not falsify 
information during a March 2016 background interview, when she stated that she had 
not used cocaine or misused prescription drugs within the seven years prior, and that 
she had not used marijuana since age 18 (SOR ¶¶ 2.h, 2.i).32 
 
 Applicant also cited to a combination of factors for failing to disclose her drug use 
on her 2015 SCA. She indicated that she misunderstood the timeframe of the drug 
questions. She indicated, without corroboration, that she was ill-advised by her FSO 
that the relevant timeframe for the drug questions was only a few years prior to the 
SCA. She also stated that she still could not recall her drug use at the time. When she 
assembled her journals to begin working on her book at the end of 2015, she refreshed 
her memory about her past drug use. She did not contact her FSO or anyone in her 
security office to correct her responses to the March 2015 SCA, because she was 
unaware it was an option. She did not seek advice from anyone because she was under 
the impression that she could not do anything to change her prior submissions.33 
 
 Applicant testified that she believed she disclosed her relevant drug use and 
misuse of prescription drugs during her 2016 background interview. She acknowledged 
that between her 2010 SCA and her 2016 background interview, she may have been 
living in denial about her past drug use. She owned up to it in her response to the 
SOR.34  
 
 Applicant testified that she did not falsify her 2015 SCA, by failing to disclose her 
2014 state tax liens from SOR ¶¶ 4.b and 4.w, or any of her delinquent debts from SOR 
¶¶ 4.c through 4.v and 4.x through 4.ff, in response to section 26 concerning her 
financial delinquencies involving enforcement and routine accounts, in the seven years 
prior to the date of the SCA (SOR ¶¶ 2.f, 2.g). She indicated that she was unaware of 
her tax liens and delinquent debts at the time. She indicated that she first learned about 
them during her 2016 background interview.35  
 
 Applicant’s supervisor since August 2014 held a security clearance as of the 
hearing date. He had daily contact with Applicant. He testified that he was aware of the 
SOR allegations pertaining to Applicant’s use of opioids and drugs as well as her 
financial issues. He was also aware Applicant’s efforts to overcome them, to include

writing a book on opioids and participation in various support groups. He testified that 
Applicant is a reliable and responsible individual, and she is a person of high integrity. 36 
  
 Applicant attributes her professional success to her supervisor’s leadership and 
mentorship. One of the many lessons she has learned from him is how to maintain calm 
in the face of chaos, which has helped her in other areas of her life outside of work. 
Applicant’s contracts manager since August 2013 attested to her high level of integrity, 
dedication to her job, strong work ethic, reliability, and accountability. Her prior customer 
reiterated the same sentiment, indicating that he observed her “extraordinary customer 
service and program support” from 1998 to 2002.37 
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard

11 
 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse 
 
 The security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG 
¶ 24: 
 
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of 
prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances 
that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner 
inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an 
individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior 
may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises 
questions about a person’s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, 
and regulations. Controlled substance means any “controlled substance” 
as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term 
adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  
 
(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); 
 
(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, 
processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of 
drug paraphernalia; and 
 
(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional 
(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical 
social worker) of substance use disorder. 
 
 Applicant misused her prescription medication and was addicted to opioids for 17 
years, from 1996 to 2013. She used marijuana in 1978 and PCP in 1985. She again 
used marijuana between 2003 and 2007, and she used cocaine between 2009 and 
2011. She was diagnosed with opiate and cocaine dependence, as well as anxiolytic 
dependence, in 2010. She has five drug-related charges from 1985 and 2009 through 
2013, and four drug-related convictions between 2009 and 2013. AG ¶¶ 25(a), 25(c), 
and 25(d) are established. 
 
12 
 
 Conditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse 
security concerns are provided under AG ¶ 26. The following are potentially applicable: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and 
substance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this 
problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not 
limited to: 
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and 
 
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug 
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future 
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security 
eligibility; 
 
(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness 
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; 
and 
 
(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, 
without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional. 
 
Applicant acknowledged her use of PCP, marijuana, and cocaine between 1978 
to 1985, and 2004 to 2011. She has not used any illegal drugs since 2011. Of her four 
drug-related convictions, only one--in December 2010--involved illegal drug use. She 
has not had any such drug-related arrests or convictions since. AG ¶ 26(b) partially 
applies to SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. 
 
Applicant also acknowledged her 17-year struggle with opioid addiction, which 
stemmed from an opioids prescription in 1996 for chronic pain from a car accident 
injury. She turned her life around after the February 2013 passing of her ex-husband 
and subsequent opioid-related conviction. She quit opioids cold turkey. She 
disassociated herself from drug-using associates and contacts, and she avoids places 
where she used to use drugs. AG ¶ 26(c) applies to SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.h. 
 
While commendable, Applicant’s five-year abstinence from opioids misuse is not 
sufficient at this time to overcome her 17-year period of opioid addiction and her three 
convictions related to her misuse of opioids between 2009 and 2013. In 2010, when she 
was diagnosed with opiate and cocaine dependence, as well as anxiolytic dependence, 
 
13 
 
she was recommended to seek outpatient treatment. She did not provide evidence that 
she satisfactorily completed a prescribed drug treatment program. Nor has she provided 
evidence of a favorable prognosis by a medical professional. She did not provide a 
signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. I 
find that her behavior did not happen so long ago, was not infrequent, did not happen 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it continues to cast doubt on 
her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 26(a), 26(b) and 26(d) 
do not apply to SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.h. 
 
Guideline J, Criminal Conduct  
 
AG ¶ 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct:  
 
Criminal activity creates doubt about a person’s judgment, reliability, and 
trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person’s ability 
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. 
AG ¶ 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. I considered the following relevant: 
(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an 
admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of 
whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  
Applicant’s 2005 assault charge was isolated and dismissed. AG ¶ 31(b) is not 
established for SOR ¶ 3.a. However, Applicant’s five drug-related charges from 1985, 
2009, 2010, and 2013 stemmed from her illegal drug use and misuse of prescription 
drugs. The latter three of such charges resulted in four drug-related convictions. AG ¶ 
31(b) is established for SOR ¶ 3.b. 
I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 32 and considered 
the following relevant:  
(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it 
happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur 
and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, or 
good judgment; and  
(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited 
to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, 
compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher 
education, good employment record, or constructive community 
involvement. 
 For the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline H analysis, AG ¶¶ 32(a) 
and 32(d) do not apply to SOR ¶ 3.b. 
 
 
14 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay her debts, to include her delinquent state taxes. The 
evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; 
 
15 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
Conditions beyond her control contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. For 
the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must provide evidence that she acted 
responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not provided corroborating 
documentation of her efforts to resolve the SOR debts. There is insufficient evidence to 
conclude that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) is 
partially applicable. 
 
 Applicant testified that she paid SOR ¶ 1.q. She indicated she was paying the 
state tax liens in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.w. She indicated that she disputed the medical 
debts in SOR ¶¶ 4.j to 4.p, 4.r to 4.v, 4.aa, and 4.dd to 4.ff. She also indicated that she 
was working with a credit-repair service to resolve her remaining delinquent debts. 
However, she did not provide any documentation to corroborate any of her claims. Her 
finances are not under control. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that her 
financial problems are unlikely to recur. Her failure to address her delinquent debts, 
even after her 2002 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, casts doubt on her current 
reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶¶ 20(a) through 20(e) and 20(g) do 
not apply. 
 
Guideline E, Personal Conduct  
 
AG ¶ 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
AG ¶ 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying. I considered the following relevant: 
(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from 
any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or 
similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
 
16 
 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security 
eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; 
 
(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or 
omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, 
investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health 
professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national 
security eligibility determination, or other official government 
representative; 
 
(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one’s conduct, 
that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a 
foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct 
includes: 
 
(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's 
personal, professional, or community standing . . . ; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. 
 
Applicant displayed untrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unreliability. 
Her 2005 assault charge was isolated and dismissed. However, her use of illegal drugs 
and misuse of prescription drugs led to her drug-related charges and convictions. They 
also led to her financial delinquencies. AG ¶ 16(e) and 16(g) are established for SOR ¶ 
2.a. 
 
In light of her history of illegal drug use, to include misuse of prescription drugs, I 
find that Applicant intentionally falsified her 2010 and 2015 SCAs, as well as her May 
2010 and March 2016 background interviews. I do not find credible her claim that she 
could not recall any of such drug use, until she refreshed her memory when she 
gathered her journals at the end of 2015. Moreover, she disclosed her illegal drug use 
and misuse of prescription drugs to a treatment center in around late 2010, just several 
months after she completed her 2010 SCA and well before she began gathering her 
journals in late 2015. In addition, she continued to falsify information about her drug use 
during her 2016 background interview, after she had gathered her journals in late 2015. 
 
I also do not find credible Applicant’s claims that she did not know about any of 
her delinquent debts when she completed her 2015 SCA, and that she first learned 
about them during her 2016 background interviews. She knew that her finances 
suffered during her marriage, after her divorce, and during the periods in which she was 
reconciled with her ex-husband. She knew that her finances took a hit when her income 
was unsteady as a consultant and when she quit her job to care for her ex-husband 
between mid-2009 and 2012. Though she obtained a job in 2012, she knew that she 
was continuing to experience financial problems. AG ¶¶ 16(a) and 16(b) are established 
for SOR ¶¶ 2.b through 2.i. 
 
17 
 
I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 17 and considered 
the following relevant:  
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was 
caused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a 
person with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the 
individual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made 
aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the 
individual cooperated fully and truthfully; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual’s reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, 
unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely 
to recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate 
vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and 
 
(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, 
has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon 
the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to 
comply with rules and regulations. 
 
In her response to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant owned up to her past 
illegal drug use, her 17-year struggle with opioid addiction, and her criminal offenses, to 
include the drug-related incidents. She also took responsibility for her delinquent 
finances. Her supervisor and at least one of the character references were aware of 
some of the issues that led to the SOR. However, for the same reasons set forth above 
in my Guideline H, J, and F analyses, AG ¶¶ 17(c), 17(d), 17(e), and 17(g) do not apply 
to SOR ¶ 2.a. 
 
As to SOR ¶¶ 2.b through 2.i, AG ¶¶ 17(a) through 17(e) do not apply. Applicant 
did not make any prompt or good-faith efforts to correct the information on her 2010 and 
2015 SCAs about her past illegal drug use, her misuse of prescription medication, and 
her delinquent finances. Nor did she do so concerning her May 2010 and 2016 
background interviews. She failed to corroborate her claim that her FSO gave her 
incorrect advice concerning the timeframe applicable to the drug questions on her 2015 
SCA. She maintained, at hearing, that she did not intentionally falsify her SCAs and her 
 
18 
 
background interviews. She cited to a number of factors that led to her false answers, 
and acknowledged that at the time, she was still living in denial. Her supervisor and at 
least one of the character references were aware of only some of the issues that led to 
the SOR. Her reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness remain questionable. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guidelines H, J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the security concerns involving drug involvement and substance misuse, 
criminal conduct, financial considerations, and personal conduct.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline H:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:    For Applicant  
Subparagraphs 1.e - 1.h:    Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 2.a - 2.i:    Against Applicant 
 
 
 
19 
 
Paragraph 3, Guideline J:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraph 3.a:     For Applicant 
Subparagraph 3.b:     Against Applicant 
 
Paragraph 4, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
Subparagraphs 4.a - 4.ff:    Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security 
clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
