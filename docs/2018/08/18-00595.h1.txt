MASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant’s favorable evidence in mitigation is insufficient to outweigh the 
disqualifying evidence under the financial considerations guideline. Eligibility for security 
clearance access is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On January 30, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for 
Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (Item 3) to retain a security clearance required for a 
position with a defense contractor. He provided summary interviews (PSIs) (Item 4) to 
an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on August 15, 2017, 
October 24, 2017, and November 1, 2017. On March 14, 2018, DOD issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security reasons under the financial 
considerations guideline (Guideline F).   The action was taken under Executive Order 
(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), 
as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive 
Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for 
 
  2 
 
Determining Eligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a 
Sensitive Position (AGs). The AGs became applicable on June 8, 2017, to all individuals 
who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility 
to hold a sensitive position.  
 
Applicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on April 9, 2018. He elected 
to have his case decided on a written record instead of a hearing. The Government sent 
Applicant a copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), the Government’s evidence in 
support of the allegations in the SOR, on April 24, 2018. Applicant received the FORM 
on May 1, 2018. The Government advised Applicant that he could either file objections, 
furnish explanations, submit additional material, or take advantage of all three options 
within 30 days of receiving the FORM. Applicant mailed his eight-page response to the 
FORM on May 22, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) received 
the response on May 25, 2018. On May 29, 2018, Department Counsel forwarded 
Applicant’s response (without objection) to the DOHA administrative staff for 
assignment to an administrative judge. On July 26, 2018, I was assigned this case. 
Applicant’s eight-page response is admitted into evidence.  
 
Rulings on Procedure 
 
 In a footnote on the first and second page of the FORM, Department Counsel 
advised Applicant that the PSIs (Item 4) would be excluded from evidence if he objected 
to them. Alternatively, Department Counsel advised him that he could correct, update, 
or modify the exhibit to improve the exhibit’s clarity or accuracy. Applicant did not object, 
and the PSIs are admitted into evidence. See E3.1.20. of DOD Directive 5220.6, page 
52.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 The SOR alleges one judgment (SOR 1.a) and six delinquent accounts totaling 
$56,360 (SOR 1.b-1.g). The judgment is $44,786. The four commercial charge 
accounts, credit card accounts, and a secured loan account total $11,574. Applicant 
admitted all accounts with explanations.  
 
 Applicant is 61 years old. He has been married since April 1980, and has a 32-
year-old daughter. He received a bachelor’s degree in May 1984. From January 2017 to 
the present, he has been employed as an engineer with a defense contractor. Since 
2007, he has held a part-time job on a board of directors. From 1979 to October 2016, 
he owned and managed a small farm implement and equipment company. This is his 
first security clearance application. His interim security clearance was withdrawn after 
he received the SOR in March 2018. (Item 3 at 9-17, 26) 
 
 Applicant indicated that his financial problems were caused by a severe drought 
in 2016 that forced him to close his small farm implement and equipment business in 
October 2016. When he was interviewed by the OPM investigator in August 2017, he 
 
  3 
 
believed he was on the verge of selling the business property which would improve his 
financial predicament. When the sale did not occur, his bank converted the two 
business-property mortgages into monthly payments (instead of quarterly interest 
payments), and he had to sign personal-liability guarantees on two business debts until 
the business property was sold. As a result of his bank’s actions, his total monthly 
payments, including his monthly personal home mortgage of $1,105, was $3,396, an 
amount that precluded him from addressing other debts with a monthly take-home pay 
(sometime in 2017) of $3,424. He contended that he sold his personal property to pay 
the bills. No documentation was submitted to indicate when Applicant’s bank made the 
business-property debt decisions. No documentation was submitted to support his 
monthly payment claims. (Item 3 at 10-13; answer to SOR at 2) 
 
 Applicant explained that he was unemployed for 11 months after his business 
closed in October 2016. That would mean that he did not start working with his current 
employer until about September 2017. Though he claims that after his hire with his 
current employer, he had to wait six months for his interim security clearance, his e-QIP 
indicates that he began working as an engineer with his current employer in January 
2017. After receiving the last payment on the sale of his business property on April 7, 
2018, he indicated that he paid two mortgages and freed up over $1,500 of his income 
to pay off listed and unlisted debts. Applicant claimed he paid off all other personal 
debts and made arrangements to resolve all delinquent debts. No documentation was 
provided to substantiate his claim of paying off the two mortgages or paying off all 
other personal debts. (emphasis added). He received a pay raise before he was laid 
off following issuance of the SOR (circa March 2018). The delinquent accounts will be 
addressed in the order they appear in the SOR. (April 2018 answer to SOR) 
 
 At the start of the security investigation process, Applicant signed and certified an 
e-QIP on January 30, 2017. Section 26 of the application requires information about 
judgments and other types of delinquent financial accounts with the federal government 
or commercial creditors. In answering “No” to all the financial questions, Applicant did 
not disclose the SOR 1.a judgment or the SOR 1.d delinquent account. He has never 
had credit counseling or related counseling service to address his financial difficulties.  
(Item 3 at 26-27) 
 
 SOR 1.a – This civil judgment, which was filed in September 2016, relates to 
three acres of land and a commercial building that Applicant used for his farming 
implement and equipment business until it closed in October 2016.  As Applicant 
explained in his April 2018 answer to the SOR, this was a business debt that according 
to the original agreement with the plaintiff, he had been paying $300 weekly for many 
months until the bank converted his business mortgages into monthly payments. In his 
August 2018 PSI, he claimed he had been making $300 payments every two weeks to 
the plaintiff on the business debt. (No record of payments was furnished.) After the 
business property sold, Applicant could not reach the plaintiff to arrange a new 
agreement. He intended to keep trying to resolve the judgment. In his May 2018 
response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that he located the plaintiff, but his phone 
 
  4 
 
calls went unanswered. He averred that he would keep trying to establish contact. No 
additional information was provided. (Item 3 at 10-15; Item 4 at 5; Item 7 at 1-4; April 
2018 answer to SOR at 4; May 2018 response to FORM)  
 
 SOR 1.b – This is a delinquent credit-card account that was opened in 2006 and 
became delinquent in July 2017. In Applicant’s August 2017 PSI, he claimed he was 
making payments on the account. In April 2018, he indicated that he had agreed to a 
reduced payment schedule and would mail a copy of the schedule if required. In his 
May 2018 response to the FORM, Applicant submitted an acknowledgement of 
payment dated May 10, 2018, confirming the creditor had received a payment, but there 
is no indication of the payment amount. No payment plan was submitted to bolster 
Applicant’s April 2018 claim of a payment schedule. (Item 4 at 3; Item 6 at 2; April 2018 
answer to SOR at 4; May 2018 response to the SOR) 
 
 SOR 1.c – This is a charge account that was opened in 2009 and became 
delinquent in October 2016. The documentation supplied by Applicant refers to an 
unlisted charge-card account that was opened in 1991 and became delinquent in March 
2017. The account numbers of the listed charge account and unlisted charge card are 
different. Applicant’s documented payments of $760 on April 9, 2018, and $100 on May 
4, 2018, are payments that apply to the delinquent charge-card debt.  (Item 4 at 3; Item 
5 at 9; Item 6 at 2; April 2018 answer to SOR at 4-5; May 2018 response to the SOR) 
 
 SOR 1.d – This is a charge account that was opened in 2013 and became 
delinquent in September 2016. In his August 2017 PSI, Applicant claimed that he was 
making payments on the account. However, in his April 2018 answer to the SOR, he 
indicated that he was trying to find the creditor to settle the debt. In May 2018, he 
indicated that he had agreed to a payment plan with the collection agency, but had not 
received the plan. He provided documentation of making a $100 payment on May 22, 
2018. No payment plan was furnished. (Item 4 at 3; Item 6 at 2; April 2018 answer to 
SOR at 5; May 2018 response to the SOR) 
 
 SOR 1.e – This is a charge account that was opened in 2002 and became 
delinquent in June 2017. In his April 2018, Applicant indicated that he brought the 
account to a current status with a credit-card payment of $794. He supplied additional 
documentation showing that he made a $138 payment on April 14, 2018, and a $133 
payment on May 4, 2018. (Item 6 at 3; April 2018 answer to SOR at 5; May 2018 
response to the SOR)  
 
 SOR 1.f – This is a secured loan that was opened in May 2017 and became 
delinquent in September 2017. Documentation shows that Applicant repaid the loan on 
April 9, 2018. (April 2018 answer to SOR) 
 
 SOR 1.g – This is a mail-order account that was opened in 2006 and became 
delinquent in April 2017. In August 2017, Applicant claimed he was making payments 
on the account. In April 2018, he stated that he was trying to contact with the entity 
 
  5 
 
handling this account. In May 2018, Applicant indicated that he had located and 
negotiated an agreement with the collection agency calling for $50 monthly payments 
from May 2018 through April 2019. He provided documentation of a payment plan, but 
no documented payments were furnished under the plan. (Item 4 at 5; Item 5 at 5; Item 
6 at 3; April 2018 answer to SOR at 5; May 2018 response to the SOR) 
 
 Applicant provided documentation confirming that on April 2, 2018, he paid $747 
on an unlisted credit card. On the same day, he paid another unlisted credit card 
company $701. Applicant made documented payments of $760 on April 9, 2018, and 
$100 on May 4, 2018, on a delinquent charge-card account. He recommended that his 
references be contacted to obtain information about his financial problems and his good 
character. (Item 5 at 10; Item 6 at 2-4; April 2018 response to SOR) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant indicated that he received a pay raise in March 2018. He provided no 
independent character evidence.  
 
Policies 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which 
are flexible rules of law, are applied together with common sense and the general 
factors of the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the 
paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(d) requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel 
being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national 
security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . .” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. 
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by 
rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial 
distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, 
 
  6 
 
other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health 
conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known 
sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal 
activity, including espionage. 
 
The judgment and delinquent debts totaling $56,360, which became delinquent 
between September 2016 and September 2017, support the application of the following 
disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.   
 
AG ¶ 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control; and  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 Between September 2016 and September 2017, Applicant incurred four 
delinquent credit-card and charge accounts, a secured loan account, and a judgment. 
To Applicant’s credit, he brought the SOR 1.e account to a current status, and has 
satisfied the SOR 1.f account. Applicant has presented insufficient evidence under the 
other five delinquent debts to confidently conclude that his financial difficulties will not 
persist in the future. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 The drought of 2016 caused Applicant’s business to close in October 2016. A 
civil judgment was filed against him in September 2016 for a business debt he was 
 
  7 
 
unable to pay. He incurred six delinquent accounts between September 2016 and 
September 2017. Though he denied having any delinquent accounts or a judgment in 
his January 2017 e-QIP, he admitted in his August 2017 PSI that he was responsible for 
the listed debts and the judgment, but he provided no supporting documentation of his 
claims that he was making payments on the debts and the judgment. Applicant receives 
mitigation under the first prong of AG ¶ 20(b), but mitigation under the second prong of 
the condition is limited to his responsible action in resolving the delinquent accounts 
identified at SOR 1.e and 1.f.1   
 
 Applicant has never had financial counseling, specifically in the period after his 
business closed in October 2016. While he provided satisfactory evidence to show two 
accounts are no longer delinquent, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that his 
financial delinquencies are under control, primarily because of Applicant’s lack of 
documented action to deal with the September 2016 judgment (SOR 1.a). AG ¶ 20(c) 
does not apply. AG ¶ 20(d) applies affirmatively to Applicant’s successful efforts to 
satisfy SOR 1.e, and to restore SOR 1.f to a current status.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
I have examined the evidence under the financial considerations guideline in the 
context of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for 
access to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  
 
 Applicant, 61 years old, has been married since 1980, and has an adult-aged 
daughter. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1984. He owned his own business for about 
37 years. He began working for his current employer in about September 2017, and in 
March 2018, he received a pay raise before his interim clearance was suspended 
because of his indebtedness. The record shows that he resolved two listed accounts 
and paid on three unlisted charge card accounts in April 2018. 
 
                                            
1 AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply to Applicant’s loss of employment due to the suspension of his 
interim security clearance.  
 
  8 
 
 The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial 
than the above mitigating evidence. Applicant furnished documents or explanations for 
all the SOR allegations. However, except for SOR 1.e and 1.f, the documentation is 
insufficient to establish his ultimate burden of persuasion under SOR 1.a-1.d, and 1g. 
Regarding 1.a, Applicant quoted several business and personal accounts that were 
difficult to pay when his bank converted his business property to personal accounts. He 
quoted $300 payments every two weeks or every month that he had been making to the 
plaintiff in SOR 1.a for many months. But, he presented no track record of payments, 
i.e., receipts, bank statements, that support any of his payment claims. In addition, he 
submitted no proof of his efforts to contact the plaintiff in SOR 1.a.  
 
 Concerning SOR 1.b, there is a record of a payment, but there is no indication of 
the amount or documentation verifying a payment agreement. Applicant presented no 
evidence under SOR 1.c. Proof of a $100 payment without a payment plan does not 
restore SOR 1.d to a current status. Regarding SOR 1.g, proof of a payment plan is not 
persuasive unless supported by substantiated evidence of payments. 
 
  Judging by the totality of the evidence, Applicant has not presented a meaningful 
track record of debt reduction through payment of debts. While an applicant is not 
required to show that he has addressed each listed debt in the SOR, he is obligated to 
show a plan and significant evidence that consummates the plan. Applicant’s 
documentation fails to include a plan to resolve SOR 1.a-1.d, and 1.g, and a meaningful 
track record of documented payments under the plan. On balance, the security 
concerns raised by the guideline for financial considerations remain unmitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the 
SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:    AGAINST APPLICANT 
  
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.g:   Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.e, 1.f:    For Applicant   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  9 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant 
Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility or access to classified 
information is denied.
