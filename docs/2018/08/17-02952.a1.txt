KEYWORD: Guideline F
DIGEST: Besides not alleging that Applicant failed to file his Federal income taxes for 2008-
2012, the SOR also did not allege that he owed Federal and state taxes and that he owed the large
student loan, i.e., presumably the one for over $80,000.  When the weight of the decision is
based on non-alleged issues, a question arises as to whether an applicant has been denied due
process because he or she was not given adequate notice and an opportunity to respond. Adverse
decision remanded.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Pro se
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On
October 3, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On April 23, 2018, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings
and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant’s request for a security
clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issues in his appeal: whether Applicant was denied due
process and whether the Judge’s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. 
Consistent with the following, we remand the Judge’s unfavorable clearance decision. 
The Judge’s Findings of Fact
The SOR set forth three allegations.  It alleged that Applicant did not file his Federal and
state tax returns for 2013 through 2016 and had a delinquent student loan for about $13,200.  He
filed his 2013-2015 Federal and state tax returns in October 2017 and his 2016 Federal and state tax
returns in May 2017.1  He provided an undated payment plan for the delinquent student loan in
which he was scheduled to make monthly payments of $5 from October 2017 to June 2018.  No
documentation was provided of payments under that plan. 
A number of non-alleged financial issues were discussed in the decision.  In 2015,
Applicant’s wages were garnished for delinquent state taxes from 2013.  He intended to make a
payment plan for delinquent Federal taxes of an unspecified amount.  He owes a university
collection agency about $5,900 and a student loan agency about $82,700.  This latter loan became
delinquent in 2010.  In late 2017, the IRS responded to Applicant’s request to establish a payment
plan that would address his delinquent Federal taxes for 2008 through 2016.  Under that plan he
would make monthly payments of $130, starting in early 2018.  In a footnote, the Judge cited to
ISCR Case No. 08-09232 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010), indicating that he considered evidence of
non-alleged financial issues in assessing Applicant’s case in mitigation and in evaluating the overall
record in the whole person concept. 
 
The Judge’s Analysis
“Based on Applicant’s failure to file his federal and state 2013 through 2015 tax returns until
October 2017, and, except for the garnishment to satisfy his 2013 state taxes, the lack of evidence
indicating that he paid federal and state taxes from 2008 through 2016, I infer that he did not file
federal returns from 2008 through 2012.  Applicant still owes over $85,000 for the delinquent
student loans.”  Decision at 6.  
1 The Judge noted that Applicant initially filed his 2015 tax returns in May 2017, but refiled them in October
2017 because his tax preparer did not inform him where to sign the returns.  
2
“There is no evidence that Applicant filed the unalleged federal and state tax returns for 2008
through 2012.  He provided no evidence of paying his federal or state taxes for 2008 though 2016.” 
Decision at 7.  In his whole-person analysis, the Judge also mentions that Applicant did not disclose
his tax or student loan issues in his 2016 security clearance application (SCA) and, when later
questioned by an investigator, he could not give a reason for the omission.
Discussion
In his appeal brief, Applicant raises a due process concern.  Specifically, he states:
I provided copies of my 2013 though 2016 tax returns in my notarized SOR.  The
SOR did not question or request information on my 2008 through 2012 tax returns. 
. . .  It is erroneous to state the tax returns have not been file[d] when the tax returns
were never questioned or copies requested.
We conclude Applicant’s argument has merit.  The Judge erred in concluding that Applicant
did not file his Federal tax returns from 2008 to 2012.  In the decision, the Judge notes that he
inferred Applicant did not file his Federal tax returns for those years based on his failure to file
Federal and state tax returns for 2013-2015 in a timely manner and the lack of evidence indicating
he paid Federal and state taxes for 2008 through 2012.  The only evidence regarding Applicant’s
Federal tax issues for 2008-2012 is an IRS installment agreement that indicates he owes an
unspecified amount of taxes for each of those years.2  The fact that an individual owes the IRS back
taxes for a particular year does not establish the individual failed to file his or her Federal income
taxes for that year.  Moreover, proof that an individual failed to file tax returns in a timely manner
for certain years does not establish he or she failed to file such returns for earlier years.  The Judge’s
conclusion that Applicant failed to file his Federal income taxes for 2008-2012 is not based on
substantial evidence,  i.e., “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate
to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.”  Directive ¶
E3.1.32.1 and ISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018). 
We note that the Judge mentioned three times in the decision that Applicant failed to file his
Federal income tax returns for 2008-2012.  While the Judge stated that he would only consider non-
alleged issues for limited purposes, a major portion of the decision is devoted to non-alleged issues. 
For example, on the first page of the decision, the Judge summarized the case as follow:
Applicant filed four federal and state tax returns for tax years 2013 though 2016, but
has more returns from 2008 though 2012 that have not been filed.  He has delinquent
federal and state taxes that he owes.  He also owes a large student loan debt that
became delinquent over seven years ago.  His evidence in mitigation is insufficient
to overcome the lingering security concerns arising from the guideline for financial
considerations.  Eligibility for security clearance access is denied.
2  The reference section of the IRS installment agreement not only lists the years involved, but also states:
“Forms: 1040,” which possibly could mean those forms were filed for the years in question.

Besides not alleging that Applicant failed to file his Federal income taxes for 2008-2012, the SOR
also did not allege that he owed Federal and state taxes and that he owed the large student loan, i.e.,
presumably the one for over $80,000.3  When the weight of the decision is based on non-alleged
issues, a question arises as to whether an applicant has been denied due process because he or she
was not given adequate notice and an opportunity to respond.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-11375
at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 17, 2016).  Such a question exists in this case.  In this regard, the Board has 
held that an SOR should be easily amended.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08547 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug.
30, 2007).  As long as there is fair notice to the affected party and the affected party has a reasonable
opportunity to respond, a case should be adjudicated on the merits of the relevant issues.  Id.  
Accordingly, we remand this case for a new Decision in accordance with the Directive.  The
Judge may reopen the record to amend the SOR provided that the parties have fair notice and a
reasonable opportunity to respond.  If the record is reopened, Applicant should be entitled to another
opportunity to elect a hearing.
3 The SOR also did not allege that Applicant falsified his SCA.  However, the Judge discussed Applicant’s SCA
omission in his findings of fact and analysis.  Furthermore, the Judge concluded that Applicant did not provide evidence
of paying his state taxes for 2008 though 2016; however, there was  no evidence presented that he was delinquent for
state taxes between 2008 through 2012.
