Decision 
___________ 
 
HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 1994 to May 2015. He did 
not hold a security clearance during his involvement with marijuana. Security concerns 
under Guidelines H (drug involvement and substance misuse) and E (personal conduct) 
are mitigated. Applicant did not submit enough documentary corroborating information 
about his finances to mitigate Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On May 27, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1). On May 19, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), 
January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to 
Classified Information, effective on September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the 
 
2                                         
 
SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines H, E, and F. Hearing Exhibit 
(HE) 2. 
 
On July 12, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR. HE 3. On September 
11, 2017, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On February 16, 2018, the case 
was assigned to me. On March 26, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals 
(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for May 3, 2018. (HE 1) Applicant’s 
hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered 9 exhibits; Applicant offered 23 
exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. 
Tr. 14-27; GE 1-9; AE A-W. On May 15, 2018, DOHA received a copy of the hearing 
transcript. The record closed on July 9, 2018. (Tr. 78, 82) 
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A new adjudicative guidelines (AGs), which he made 
applicable to all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access 
to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position on or after June 8, 2017. 
The new AGs supersede the previous AGs, and I have evaluated Applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility under the new AGs.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 Applicant’s SOR response admitted in part SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d, 3.d, and 3.e. 
(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions are accepted as 
findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  
 
Applicant is 44-year-old engineer. (Tr. 28; GE 1) In 1999, he graduated from a top-
tier engineering school with a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 28-29; GE 1) He has not served in 
the military. (GE 1) In 2003, he married, and his children were born in 2005, 2007, and 
2010. (GE 1) He has never held a security clearance or a sensitive position such as a 
police officer. (Tr. 73) 
 
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct  
 
In Applicant’s May 27, 2016 SCA, he admitted use of marijuana in college on a 
weekly basis.3 After college, he used marijuana during parties and vacations. Following 
his marriage in 2003, he used marijuana about every six months usually on golfing and 
fishing trips. The police caught Applicant in possession of marijuana in May 2011 and 
May 2015. He was not convicted of marijuana possession for either offense.     
                                            
1 Application of the AGs that were in effect as of the issuance of the SOR would not change my 
decision in this case. The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/SEAD4 20170608.pdf.    
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
3 The information in this paragraph is from Applicant’s May 27, 2016 Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1).  
 
3                                         
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d allege under the drug involvement and substance misuse 
guideline that Applicant possessed and used marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia. In 
2003, 2011, and 2015, his marijuana possession resulted in the involvement of the police. 
SOR ¶ 2 cross alleges the same conduct as in SOR ¶ 1 under the personal conduct 
guideline. The status of those allegations is as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from 1994 to 
at least May 2015. Applicant admitted that he possessed and used marijuana from 1994 
to May 2015.  
 
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and 
identity fraud in January 2003. The police stopped Applicant, and Applicant gave the 
police his brother’s identification because he did not have his own identification. (Tr. 30, 
64) He admitted that the small amount of marijuana in his vehicle was his marijuana. (Tr. 
30, 64)    
 
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant was charged with marijuana possession and speeding 
in May 2011. Applicant was in his vehicle with several others. (Tr. 31, 64) The police 
stopped Applicant for driving 55 miles per hour (MPH) in a 45 MPH zone. (Tr. 31) A police 
officer smelled marijuana because one of his passengers was smoking marijuana. (Tr. 
31) Applicant denied that it was his marijuana. (Tr. 65) Applicant was charged with 
marijuana possession because it was in his vehicle; however, the charge was dismissed 
because the marijuana found in his vehicle was not Applicant’s marijuana. (Tr. 31)   
 
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of 
marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia in May 2015. Applicant was on a fishing trip, and 
the police stopped Applicant because the tags on his vehicle were expired. (Tr. 31-32, 
65) Applicant and his associates each had some marijuana on their person. (Tr. 32, 66) 
The marijuana charge was dismissed after Applicant completed community service.  
 
Applicant said he used marijuana to alleviate stress. (Tr. 32, 66-67; SOR response) 
He was reluctant to seek medical help for the stress because of his culture. (Tr. 67) He 
received a prescription for Wellbutrin, and he has a current prescription for Wellbutrin. 
(Tr. 68) He no longer needs marijuana to help with stress. (Tr. 32) He realizes that 
marijuana possession and use show poor judgment, and he wants to be a good example 
to his children. (Tr. 71) He recognized the adverse impact of drug abuse. He also 
understands that possession of marijuana violates federal law and constitutes criminal 
conduct. He does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 33, 72) He does not 
associate with users of illegal drugs. (Tr. 69)    
 
Financial Considerations  
 
 In 2004, Applicant and a partner purchased a small company with gross annual 
revenue of about $750,000. (Tr. 29) In 2009, he bought out his partner. (GE 1) Applicant 
promised to pay the original owner of the company $7,000 monthly, and he completed all 
payments in November 2017. (Tr. 34) Applicant owns the subchapter S corporation now. 
(Tr. 34, 57) His corporation’s annual income is currently about $70,000,000. (Tr. 29) His 
corporation performs construction as a general contractor on large projects. (Tr. 35) 
 
4                                         
 
Applicant and his spouse both work for his corporation, and his corporation is their only 
source of income. (Tr. 70)   
 
The SOR in ¶ 3 alleges seven financial issues. The status of each SOR allegation 
is as follows:  
 
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges an unpaid federal tax lien entered in February 2013, for 
$126,000. Applicant said the debt resulted from errors by his accountant or bookkeeper. 
(SOR response) The lien resulted from tax year 2010. (SOR response, Ex. 4) On 
November 9, 2016, this tax lien was released. (SOR response, Ex. 4) Applicant said the 
debt was paid. (SOR response) 
 
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges an unpaid federal tax lien entered in April 2014, for $31,148. 
Applicant admitted it was his tax debt. He owed $7,556 for tax year 2006, and $23,592 
for tax year 2011. From October 2016 to January 2018, he made payments. He completed 
payment of the tax debt, and on February 1, 2018, this tax lien was released. (Tr. 72; AE 
B) 
 
Applicant said his tax returns were amended three times. (Tr. 56) His tax transcript 
for tax year 2011 indicates transfers from tax years 2010 and 2015 in October 2016, 
February 2017, March 2017, and May 2017. (AE B) He is credited with paying his tax bills 
for tax years 2010 and 2015 with a surplus.

 SOR ¶ 3.c alleges an unpaid federal tax lien entered in February 2012, for 
$77,074.4 The lien was for tax years 2008 and 2009. (SOR response, Ex. 5) 
 
 Applicant said the tax debts resulted from his business; however, they were filed 
against Applicant in his personal capacity. (Tr. 53) Applicant’s business failed to pay the 
payroll tax for four or five quarters for employees in a different state from where Applicant 
lived. (Tr. 54) Applicant blamed the problem on his managers. (Tr. 54) The IRS entered 
the liens to reinforce his payment plan. (Tr. 54) Applicant focused on the construction 
management of his corporation, and he said his employees were responsible for ensuring 
corporate finances were properly handled. (Tr. 55) 
 
SOR ¶ 3.d alleges a corporate judgment against Applicant for $600,000. A 
subcontractor sued Applicant initially for $22 million. (Tr. 38) Eventually the claim was 
negotiated down to $600,000. (Tr. 38) The settlement agreement is confidential. (Tr. 58) 
During his August 25, 2016 Office of Personnel Management personal subject interview 
(OPM PSI), Applicant said he owed about $300,000 to the creditor, and he planned to 
have the debt satisfied by 2018. (GE 2 at 5) At his hearing, he said the current balance 
                                            
4 SOR ¶ 3.c was withdrawn at the request of Department Counsel because the lien was not placed 
against Applicant. (Tr. 11-12; HE 2) 
 
5                                         
 
owed is $240,000, and Applicant plans to pay this debt in two years. (Tr. 39, 59) He 
currently pays $7,166 monthly to the creditor. (Tr. 60) Department Counsel asked for a 
copy of the agreement and proof of the payments. (Tr. 60) 
 
SOR ¶ 3.e alleges an unpaid judgment entered against Applicant for $3,100 
entered in March 2016. Applicant said the debt was for condominium fees for about 18 
months, and in June 2017, the debt was satisfied. (Tr. 60; SOR response, Ex. 6) 
 
SOR ¶ 3.f alleges an unpaid medical judgment entered against Applicant for 
$1,066 in August 2014. Applicant said he paid this debt. (Tr. 61) Applicant indicated he 
believed he could locate a receipt showing payment. (Tr. 62) He did not provide a receipt 
showing payment. 
 
I requested that Applicant provide tax transcripts for 2008 to present, a current 
credit report, and information about the status of the debt in SOR ¶ 3.d. (Tr. 75-77) He 
said he does not owe any state income taxes. (Tr. 76) He did not provide any post-hearing 
documentation.  
 
Applicant successfully completed several high-visibility government contracts for 
the DOD and other federal agencies. (Tr. 40-52; AE E-AE W) Applicant paid several large 
debts over the years. 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
 
6                                         
 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse 
 
AG ¶ 24 articulates the security concern for drug involvement: 
 
The illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of 
prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances 
that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner 
inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an 
individual’s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may 
lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises 
questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, 
and regulations. Controlled substance means any “controlled substance” as 
defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in 
this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. 
 
AG ¶ 25 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case, “(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);” and “(c) 
illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, 
manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.” 
 
7                                         
 
Applicant possessed and used marijuana5 from 1994 to May 2015. AG ¶¶ 25(a) 
and 25(c) are established.   
 
AG ¶ 26 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance 
misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and 
has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: 
 
(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 
 
(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and 
 
(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug 
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future 
involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security 
eligibility; 
 
(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness 
during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and 
 
(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, 
including, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, 
without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified 
medical professional. 
  
The DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 
2013), concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the applicability of 
mitigating conditions as follows:  
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
                                            
 5 Schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained in 
21 U.S.C. § 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule (Sch.) I controlled substances. See Drug Enforcement 
Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales 
v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). 
 
8                                         
 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
 AG ¶ 26(a) can mitigate security concerns when drug offenses are not recent. 
There are no “bright line” rules for determining when such conduct is “recent.” The 
determination must be based “on a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within 
the parameters set by the directive.” ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 
2004). If the evidence shows “a significant period of time has passed without any evidence 
of misconduct,” then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time 
demonstrates “changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform 
or rehabilitation.”6 
 
Applicant used marijuana for more than 20 years; however, he stopped using 
marijuana in May 2015. He made a clear resolution not to use marijuana in the future. He 
recognized the adverse impact of drug abuse. He also understands that possession of 
marijuana violates federal law and constitutes criminal conduct. I accept Applicant’s 
statement that he intends to continue to abstain from illegal drug possession and use as 
credible. AG ¶ 26(a) applies to his possession and use of illegal drugs.7 AG ¶ 26(a) 
applies.    
 
                                            
6 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. 
Bd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge’s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the 
absence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge 
excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug use, 
and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal Board 
stated: 
  
Compare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage of 
three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel the 
administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, 
the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that 
mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR Case 
No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (“The administrative judge articulated a rational 
basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol 
rehabilitation.”) (citation format corrections added). 
 
In ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, affirmed the administrative 
judge’s decision to revoke an applicant’s security clearance after considering the recency analysis of an 
administrative judge stating:  
 
The administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of 
improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security 
clearance process. That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year 
from 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal 
purchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. 
 
7 In ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 8 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004), the Appeal Board reversed an 
unfavorable security clearance decision because the administrative judge failed to explain why drug use 
was not mitigated after the passage of more than six years from the previous drug abuse. In ISCR Case 
No. 14-00775 (App. Bd. July 2, 2015), the Appeal Board sustained the revocation of a security clearance 
for an Applicant, who did not hold a security clearance that used marijuana 20 months before the 
administrative judge decided the case. 
 
9                                         
 
AG ¶¶ 26(b), 26(c), and 26(d) are not fully applicable. AG ¶ 26(b) does not apply 
because he did not provide “a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug 
involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse 
is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” Applicant did not abuse drugs after 
being issued a prescription that is lawful under federal law. He did not complete a drug 
counseling or treatment program. He did receive some counseling in connection with his 
prescription for Wellbutrin. His need for marijuana is reduced because he has a prescribed 
drug to control his stress and anxiety. 
 
Applicant has not used marijuana since May 2015; he did not hold a security 
clearance when he used marijuana; he does not associate with known marijuana users; 
and he promised not to use marijuana in the future. Drug involvement security concerns 
are mitigated. 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
 
AG ¶ 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case:  
 
(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is 
not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, 
but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person 
assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack 
of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other 
characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard 
classified or sensitive information; 
 
(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any 
other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse 
determination, but which, when combined with all available information, 
supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, 
untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with 
rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual 
may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This 
includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or 
unreliable behavior . . . ; (3) a pattern of . . . rule violations; and 
 
(e) personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, 
manipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or 
 
10                                         
 
group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, 
could affect the person’s personal, professional, or community standing. 
 
Guidelines F security concerns are independently sufficient without consideration 
of Guideline H security concerns to deny Applicant’s security clearance, and AG ¶ 16(c) 
does not apply. SOR ¶ 2.a cross-alleges under the personal conduct guideline the same 
conduct alleged under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. All of 
Applicant’s conduct causing a security concern in SOR ¶ 2.a is explicitly covered under 
Guideline H in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. AG ¶ 16(d) does not apply.  
 
Applicant’s involvement with marijuana affects his professional and community 
standing. However, this conduct does not create a vulnerability to exploitation, 
manipulation, or duress because security officials are aware of it. Applicant freely and 
frankly revealed his marijuana possession and use on his SCA and discussed it during 
his OPM PSI. AG ¶ 16(e) is not established. Assuming some residual Guideline E security 
concerns remain, consideration of mitigating conditions is warranted.   
 
AG ¶ 17 lists two conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; and 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, 
unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to 
recur. 
 
AG ¶¶ 17(c) and 17(d) are established for the reasons stated in the previous drug 
involvement and substance misuse section. Personal conduct security concerns are 
mitigated. 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 
11                                         
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
 AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;” “(c) a history of not 
meeting financial obligations;” and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax as required.” The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), 
and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating 
conditions. 
 
  Seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,8 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  
 
                                            
8 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
12                                         
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
  
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges an unpaid federal tax lien entered in February 2013, for 
$126,000. The lien resulted from tax year 2010. On February 9, 2016, this tax lien was 
released. Usually a tax lien is released if the taxpayer has established a payment plan 
and complied with it for a substantial period of time or paid the tax debt. I have credited 
Applicant with mitigating this debt because the lien was released before the SOR was 
issued.  
 
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges an unpaid federal tax lien entered in April 2014, for $31,148. 
Applicant admitted it was his tax debt. According to the lien, he owed $7,556 for tax year 
2006, and $23,592 for tax year 2011. Applicant permitted his taxes to become delinquent 
in 2006 and 2011, and he did not pay his tax debt until January 2018. From October 2016 
to January 2018, he made payments to address this debt. Because of his lengthy course 
of delinquent taxes and the resolution after receipt of the SOR without an adequate 
explanation for the delinquency, I conclude he did not establish mitigation of SOR ¶ 3.b.  
 
SOR ¶ 3.d alleges a corporate judgment against Applicant for $600,000. During 
his August 25, 2016 OPM PSI, he said he owed about $300,000 to the creditor, and he 
planned to have the debt satisfied by 2018. At his hearing, he said the current balance 
owed is $240,000, and he plans to pay it off in two years. He said he pays $7,166 monthly 
to the creditor. Department Counsel asked for a copy of the settlement agreement and 
proof of the payments. He did not provide requested documentation. This debt is not 
mitigated. 
 
Applicant provided proof that the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 3.e for $3,100 entered 
in March 2016 was satisfied in June 2017. This debt is mitigated.  
 
SOR ¶ 3.f alleges an unpaid medical judgment against Applicant for $1,066. 
Applicant said he paid this debt; however, he did not provide proof that the judgment was 
satisfied. This debt is not mitigated.  
 
Applicant did not provide sufficient documentary evidence of resolution of the debts 
in SOR ¶¶ 3.b, 3.d, and 3.f. There is insufficient evidence explaining the delay in 
Applicant’s resolution of these three SOR debts. Delinquent federal taxes from 2006 to 
2018 are particularly problematic. There is insufficient assurance that these three SOR 
debts are being, will be, or are resolved. Under all the circumstances in the record before 
me, he failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
 
13                                         
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines” and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H, E, 
and F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) 
were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 44-year-old engineer. In 1999, he graduated from a top-tier 
engineering school with a bachelor’s degree. In 2004, Applicant and a partner purchased 
a small company with gross annual revenue of about $750,000. In 2009, he bought out 
his partner. His corporation’s annual income is currently about $70,000,000. His 
corporation performs construction as a general contractor on large projects. He has 
successfully completed numerous government contracts. He paid several large debts 
over the years. He ended his marijuana use in May 2015. 
 
The evidence against granting his security clearance is more persuasive. Applicant 
has had federal income tax problems since 2006. Applicant did not provide requested 
federal income tax transcripts. In ISCR Case No. 16-02322 (App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018) the 
Appeal Board reversed the grant of a security clearance because of concerns about 
timely filing and payment of income taxes. The Appeal Board noted that the applicant in 
that case failed to provide a requested IRS income tax transcript, and this failure 
undermined the conclusion that the applicant met her burden of persuasion relating to 
payment of taxes. Id. at 4 and n. 3. Applicant in this case did not provide corroborating 
documentation: (1) that his federal taxes are paid; (2) that his payments are current on 
the $600,000 judgment; and (3) that the medical judgment for $1,066 is resolved.   
 
It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant’s security 
clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a 
security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations 
concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not 
warranted at this time. This decision should not be construed as a determination that 
Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security 
clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due 
 
14                                         
 
debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able 
to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness.  
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, and the 
AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Guidelines H and 
E security concerns are mitigated; however, Guideline F security concerns are not 
mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline H:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 2, Guideline E:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraph 2.a:    For Applicant 
 
Paragraph 3, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 3.a and 3.e:   For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 3.c:    Withdrawn 
Subparagraphs 3.b, 3.d, and 3.f:  Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility 
for access to classified information is denied.
