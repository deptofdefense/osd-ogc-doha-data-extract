FOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on September 27, 2016. On 
February 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under 
Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after 
June 8, 2017. 
 
 Applicant answered the SOR on March 8, 2018, and requested a hearing before 
an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 9, 2018, 
 
2 
 
and the case was assigned to me on April 12, 2018. On May 22, 2018, the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was 
scheduled for June 14, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government 
Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AX) 1 through 6, which were admitted 
without objection. I kept the record open until June 25, 2018, to enable her to submit 
additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX 7 through 10, which were 
received without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 25, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 
1.e, 1.f, 1.i, and 1.o. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 
1.j-1.n. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings 
of fact. Department Counsel withdrew SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 16-17.) 
 
 Applicant is a 33-year-old project analyst employed by a defense contractor since 
August 2017. She was a civilian employee of the Navy from February 2014 to August 
2017. She was employed by defense contractors from November 2007 to February 
2014. She has held a security clearance in the past. (Tr. 6.)  
 
Applicant has taken college courses but has not received a degree. She married 
in May 2003, divorced in February 2016, and married her current spouse in March 
2016. She has four children from her first marriage, ages 17, 12, 7, and 3. Her oldest 
child suffers from asthma. In late 2017, she gave birth to twins, who both died shortly 
after their birth. (Tr. 24, 34.) In addition to the medical bills related to the birth and 
demise of her twins, she was required to take leave without pay while recovering. (Tr. 
24, 34.) 
 
 The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts. Department Counsel withdrew SOR ¶ 1.d 
at the beginning of the hearing. (Tr. 16.) The delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c 
and 1.e-1.o are reflected in credit reports from October 2016 (GX 3) and January 2018 
(GX 2), and court records (GX 4, 5, and 6). The evidence regarding the 14 remaining 
allegations is summarized below. 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.a: deficiency after an automobile repossession, charged off for 
$5,457. In May 2018, Applicant entered into a payment agreement providing for an 
initial $50 payment followed by monthly $150 payments. (AX 1, attachment 2.) She 
made the required payments in April and May 2018. (AX 7; AX 8.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.b: student loan more than 180 days past due for $429, with a loan 
balance of $1,934. Applicant has entered into a rehabilitation plan providing for $5 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application (GX 1) unless 
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
3 
 
payments for nine months. She made the required payments for May and June 2018 by 
automatic debit from her bank account. (AX 1, attachment 3; AX 8; AX 9.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.c: medical bill referred for collection of $963. This debt was for three 
separate bills, one for Applicant and two for her children. (Tr. 25.) It was settled for $675 
and paid on June 2, 2018. (AX 1; AX 9 at 1.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.e: medical bill referred for collection of $341. Applicant made a 
payment arrangement for this debt and paid $41 on April 21, 2018; $50 on May 11, 
2018; and $218 on June 4, 2018. (AX 7 at 1-2; AX 8 at 1; AX 9 at 2.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.f: medical bill referred for collection of $225. This debt is paid in full. 
Applicant paid $25 on April 20, 2018; and $200 on April 29, 2018. (AX 7 at 1, 4.)  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.g: telecommunications bill charged off for $225. This debt is paid in 
full. (AX 1, attachment 4; AX 7 at 1.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.h: medical bill referred for collection of $200. This debt is paid in full. 
(AX 1 at 2; AX 9 at 2.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.i: judgment for past-due rent, entered in August 2014 for $2,800. 
Applicant was evicted from her apartment when she fell behind in her rent payments. 
She was pregnant and separated from her husband, who was incarcerated. (Tr. 47.) 
She contacted the creditor in April 2018, who informed her that the company does not 
make payment agreements. The judgment is not satisfied. (AX 2.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.j: judgment for furniture, entered in October 2010 for $1,003. This 
judgment was satisfied on February 7, 2011. (AX 3 at 2.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.k: cellphone bill referred for collection of $553. Applicant paid this 
debt in full on March 20, 2017. (Answer to SOR, page 6 of attached partial credit report; 
AX 6.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.l: medical bill referred for collection of $150. This debt was paid on 
March 3, 2017. (AX 6.) 
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.n: medical bills referred for collection of $120 and $50. 
Applicant testified that she paid these bills in March 2017. The amounts reflected in her 
account statement are for more than these two bills because she included other bills not 
alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 26, 45-46; AX 6.) 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.o: judgment for medical bill, entered in June 2017 for $1,052. A 
default judgment was entered against Applicant. She was never served notice of the 
court hearing because it apparently was delivered to an address where she no longer 
lives. The return of service reflects that personal service was not made but that the 
notice was posted on the front door of the residence. (AX 4.) Applicant’s divorce decree 
 
4 
 
requires her ex-husband to pay half of medical expenses for their children. (Answer to 
SOR, attached divorce decree.) Applicant testified that she contacted the creditor three 
days before the hearing, and the creditor agreed to accept monthly payments of $214 
for five months. She had not yet received documentation of the payment agreement 
when the record closed. (Tr. 48-49.) 
 
 When Applicant divorced, her husband was ordered to pay child support of $600 
per month. He was incarcerated from December 2014 to May 2016. (Tr. 31.) He owes 
an arrearage of $97,616. (AX 5.)  
 
 Applicant’s annual pay is $65,000. Her ex-husband’s pay has been garnished for 
child support, and she started receiving bi-weekly child-support payments of $354 in 
March 2018. (Tr. 50-51.) She estimates that she has a net monthly remainder, after 
paying all her bills, of $900-$1,000. (Tr. 54.) She pays a law firm $125 per month to 
assist her in removing paid debts from her credit record. (Tr. 27, 57-58.) 
 
Policies 
 
 “[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 
484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to 
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an 
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The 
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants 
eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge 
applies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and 
commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable 
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 
10865 § 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the 
 
5 
 
applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense 
have established for issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the 
criteria listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-
01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   
 
 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, 
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  
 
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 
01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, 
if they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is 
financially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or 
otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012).

 Applicant’s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing 
establish two disqualifying conditions: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”) and AG ¶ 
19(c) (“a history of not meeting financial obligations”). The following mitigating 
conditions are potentially applicable: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling 
for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit 
credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem 
is being resolved or is under control; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant’s debts are numerous, recent, and were 
not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) is established. Applicant’s marital breakup, the unreliable conduct of 
her ex-husband, the medical needs of her children, her medical needs during a difficult 
childbirth and recovery, and the short periods when she was in a no-pay status with her 
employer were conditions beyond her control. She has acted responsibly by maintaining 
contact with her creditors, negotiating payment agreements, and making as many 
payments as her limited income has permitted. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(c) is partially established. Applicant’s law firm is not providing the type of 
financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition, but there are clear 
indications that her financial problems are being resolved. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(d) is established. Applicant has resolved or is resolving all the debts 
alleged in the SOR except the judgments alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.o. However, the 
adjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all 
delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged in the SOR first, or establish 
resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An individual needs only to establish a plan 
to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. See 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has methodically 
resolved all her delinquent debts except for the two judgments. She has negotiated with 
 
7 
 
both creditors and appears to have made substantial progress toward resolving the 
judgment in SOR ¶ 1.o. She has sufficient income to eventually satisfy the judgments in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.o. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-
person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s conduct and all relevant 
circumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).2 I have incorporated 
my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis and applied the 
adjudicative factors in AG ¶ 2(d).  
 
 Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. She has worked as a 
government employee or an employee of a defense contractor since November 2007 
and has held a security clearance in the past, apparently without incident. After 
weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating 
all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated 
the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c:    For Applicant 
 
  Subparagraph 1.d:     Withdrawn 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.e-1.o:    For Applicant 
 
                                                          
2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the 
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which 
participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.

Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance 
is granted.
