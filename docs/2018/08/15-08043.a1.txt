APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Richard Frizzell, Personal Representative
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On May
12, 2016, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. 
On February 28, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)
Administrative Judge Robert Tuider denied Applicant’s request for a security clearance.  Applicant
appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
 Applicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether he was denied due process and
whether the Judge’s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with
the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact and Analysis
The SOR, as amended, lists six allegations.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant on three
allegations and against him on three allegations.  The Judge’s unfavorable findings involve
Applicant having a delinquent Federal tax debt of about $4,400 and him failing to file his Federal
and state income tax returns for 2015 and 2016.    
In discussing tax filing deficiencies for which a favorable finding was entered, the Judge
noted that Applicant’s wife took care of the family tax returns, and she thought it was not necessary
to file those returns in a timely manner.  Other factors contributing to the delays involved serious
family medical issues, Applicant’s underemployment,  his incorrect belief that a local tax volunteer
filed his tax returns, and his wife’s periods of unemployment and, at other times, her exhaustion
from working 12-hour shifts. 
Applicant’s Federal tax debt of about $4,400 arose from tax years 2009, 2010, and 2014. 
In 2015, the IRS informed Applicant that a tax refund was withheld to pay the delinquent taxes and
he still owed $367.  At the date of the hearing, Applicant had not filed his 2015 and 2016 Federal
and state tax returns.  He initially blamed those tax filing deficiencies on problems at work, but later
conceded such problems were not the cause.  He filed the delinquent tax returns in September 2017
and noted he was “getting some refunds in these tax returns.”  Decision at 4.  He also noted that, in
the future, he planned to file his tax returns separately from his wife to ensure they are timely filed. 
 
The Judge concluded that Applicant did not establish that he acted responsibly under the
circumstances and that his tax filing deficiencies showed poor judgment.  The Judge also stated:
The main problem here is Applicant’s failure to timely file his state and
federal tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2016.  For some of these years, he was
entitled to a refund, or the taxes due were low.  For the first three years, he relied on
his spouse to file their tax returns.  For 2015 and 2016, he filed the tax returns after
his hearing.  He did not provide documentation showing the specific amount of
federal taxes due.  His failure to file his tax returns timely several years ago is
2
somewhat excused due to his underemployment, lack of education, financial
inexperience, misplaced trust in a tax volunteer, and illnesses in his family.  There
is insufficient assurance his financial problems are resolved, under control, and will
not recur in the future.  Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation
of financial considerations security concerns.1
In his whole-person analysis, the Judge also noted that Applicant did not provide documentation
showing the current status of his Federal tax debt.  
Discussion
In his appeal brief, Applicant states that he submitted documentary evidence to the Judge that
did not make it into the record.  At the hearing, the Judge left the record open to September 29,
2017, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  Tr. at 63-65.  On September 23, 2017, Applicant’s
Personal Representative sent an email to Department Counsel indicating that Applicant’s Federal
income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 and state income tax returns for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015 and
2016 were filed and Applicant was “getting some refunds in these tax returns.”  Applicant’s Exhibit
(AE) J.  On September 25, 2017, Department Counsel forwarded that email to the Judge and
included a comment, “Recognizing that our case law places a heavy emphasis on the provision of
documentary proof to corroborate oral statements or testimony, the Government defers to you as to
whether you would like to see documentary proof that the returns have been filed.”  Id.  On AE J,
there is a handwritten note pointing to Department Counsel’s above comment that states, “Sent hard
copy docs on 9/13/17[.]"  There is no indication who wrote that handwritten note.   In the decision,
the Judge noted that Applicant provided nine post-hearing exhibits (AE B through J), which were
admitted into the record without objection.  As quoted above, the Judge also noted in the decision
that, while Applicant filed his 2015 and 2016 tax returns, “[h]e did not provide documentation
showing the specific amount of Federal taxes due.”    
In the appeal brief, Applicant stated that he mailed to the Judge “copies of transmittals” on
the day of Department Counsel’s email (i.e., September 25, 2017) and attached copies of the
documents he sent.  Those documents include IRS Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization,
for 2015 and 2016, both dated September 7, 2017, which reflect Applicant’s gross income, total tax,
Federal income tax withheld, and refund or amount owed for each year.2  Those documents reflect
he qualified for refunds of $1,292 for 2015 and $1,236 for 2016.  The documents also includes two
IRS letters dated September 22, 2017, reflecting that $462 and $499 was diverted to his state taxing
authority for debts he owed.  From our review of the record, we conclude that the failure of some
1 Decision at 8.
2 The Appeal Board is generally precluded from considering new evidence on appeal.  Directive ¶ E3.1.29. 
However, in the past we have considered new evidence insofar as it bears upon questions of due process or jurisdiction. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No.14-00812 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 8, 2015).

of Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits to make it into the record was at most harmless error.  See, e.g.,
ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013)(An error is harmless if it did not likely affect
the outcome of the case).  First, we noted the Judge found that Applicant filed his 2015 and 2016
Federal income tax returns based on the Personal Representative’s email.  Second, while it is
plausible that Applicant’s delinquent tax debt has been resolved, the documents that did not make
it into the record do not explicitly state that debt is resolved.  Third, the SOR notified Applicant in
May 2016 that his tax filing deficiencies created security concerns, yet, he did not file his 2015 and
2016 Federal income tax return until weeks after his security clearance hearing in August 2017. 
Fourth, the Judge noted in the decision that the main concern was Applicant’s failure to file his tax
returns for a number of years in a timely manner.  Fifth, the Judge concluded there was “insufficient
assurance” that Applicant’s financial problems will not recur in the future.  Decision at 8.  In light
of the above,  the failure of some of Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits to make it into the record did
not affect the outcome of the case and, therefore, did not result in a denial of due process.
The balance of Applicant’s arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge’s weighing
of the evidence, which is not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that
is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan.
8, 2016).
Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge’s decision.  The Judge examined
the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is
sustainable on this record.  “The general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when
‘clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.’”  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484
U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive, Encl. 2, App A. ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt concerning personnel
being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
