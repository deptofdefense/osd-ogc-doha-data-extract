LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the security concern stemming from his history of financial 
problems or difficulties. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on March 29, 2016.1 This document is commonly known as a 
security clearance application. Thereafter, on October 31, 2017, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified

information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 15, 2017. His answers were mixed; 
he denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.m; and he admitted the remaining 
allegations. He requested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  
 
On February 12, 2018, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material 
information that could be adduced at a hearing. The file of relevant material (FORM) 
consists of Department Counsel’s written brief and supporting documentation, some of 
which are identified as evidentiary exhibits in this decision. The FORM was mailed to 
Applicant, who received it on March 20, 2018. He did not reply within 30 days of receipt 
of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on August 28, 2018. 
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee who requires a security clearance for his job 
as a network technician for a federal contractor. He has been so employed since July 
2015. He was awarded a high school diploma in 1991. He married in May 1996, and he 
and his wife have lived separately since September 1996. He has lived with a 
cohabitant since 2003. He has three children, born in 1996, 1998, and 2000. According 
to his security clearance application, he has been continuously employed since at least 
2005. This includes two periods of self-employment, the first during 2005-2009, and the 
second during 2009-2012. His employment history does not include military service. 
This is his first time applying for a security clearance.  
 
The SOR alleges a history of financial problems or difficulties consisting of the 13 
delinquent accounts ranging in amounts from $55 to $6,196 for a total of about $17,700. 
The 13 delinquent accounts stem from collection and charged-off accounts. They 
include two collection accounts for child support and two collection accounts for student 
loans. The $1,425 collection account in SOR ¶ 1.b was reduced to judgment in 
February 2016.2 Department Counsel concedes that the child-support account in SOR ¶ 
1.g is paid.3 The 12 remaining delinquent accounts are established by (1) Applicant’s 
admissions in his answer to the SOR and (2) credit reports from June 2016 and 
September 2017.4  
 
Applicant did not submit any supporting documentation with his answer to the 
SOR. Nor did he take advantage of the opportunity to reply to the FORM by submitting 
documentation in extenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate, in support of 
his case. Given these circumstances, there is no documentation to establish that the

remaining 12 delinquent accounts were paid, settled or compromised, in a payment

Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.5 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.6 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”7 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that 
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.8 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.9 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.10 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.11 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.12 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.13 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate

facts that have been admitted or proven.14 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.15 
  
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . .16 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other 
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions:  
 
 AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
 AG ¶ 19(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. There is no reliable 
documentary evidence that Applicant has made forward progress in resolving the 
remaining 12 delinquent accounts that altogether total more than $16,000 in delinquent 
debt. His problematic financial history suggests he may be irresponsible, unconcerned, 
or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive information.  
 
 What is missing here is documentation in support of Applicant’s case. There is no 
documentation to establish that he initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to pay

his other delinquent debts. He has not met his burden of production because he did not 
present sufficient documentation showing that he is making some sort of effort to 
resolve his delinquent debts.  
  
 Applicant’s history of financial problems or difficulties creates doubt about his 
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In 
reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the 
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also 
considered the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that he did not meet his 
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 The formal findings on the SOR allegations are: 
 
  Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   Against Applicant  
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.f:   Against Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.g:    For Applicant 
Subparagraphs 1.h – 1.m:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to 
classified information. Eligibility denied.
