MURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to file annual state and federal income tax returns on time, as 
required, for a ten-year period from tax years 2007-2016. He did not mitigate the 
resulting financial security concerns. Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified 
information is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 2, 2016. 
On June 17, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility 
(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security 
concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations.1 
  
                                                          
1 The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security 
Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017.

 Applicant answered the SOR on July 5, 2017, and requested a hearing. The case 
was assigned to me on October 16, 2017. On October 26, 2017, a Notice of Hearing 
was issued scheduling the hearing for November 16, 2017. On November 9, 2017, the 
hearing date was rescheduled to November 15, 2017, a date to which Applicant 
consented.2 The hearing convened on that date. 
 
 Government’s Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3 were admitted without objection. 
Applicant testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through J, which were 
admitted without objection. I held the record open to allow Applicant the opportunity to 
submit additional documentation. He subsequently submitted AE K through AE U, all of 
which were admitted without objection.3 The record closed on January 12, 2018. DOHA 
received the hearing transcript on November 30, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact  
 
 Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, and denied SOR ¶ 1.d, all with 
explanations.4 His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough 
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following 
additional findings of fact.  
 
 Applicant is 44 years old. He and his wife have been married for 11 years. They 
have two daughters, ages 7 and 11. Applicant earned his bachelor’s degree in electrical 
engineering in 1998 and earned a master’s degree in business administration (MBA) in 
2006. Since 1998, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor at a naval shipyard. 
He currently holds a security clearance, most recently granted in 2011. (Tr. 14, 23-25, 
46, 85-86; GE 1) 
 
 In a May 2017 interrogatory response, Applicant indicated that he had failed to 
timely file his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2007-2016. Applicant 
provided IRS account transcripts for tax years 2011 and 2012. He included 
documentation from the IRS indicating that, as of November 2016, the IRS had no 
record that he had filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014 and 
2015. When he submitted his May 2017 interrogatory response, Applicant indicated that 
by that time, he had filed all his past-due income tax returns, but for his 2016 income tax 
returns, which were in process. He also indicated that he no longer owed any state or 
federal past-due income taxes. Other than for tax years 2011 and 2012, he provided no 
supporting documentation. (GE 2)

3 Some of Applicant’s post-hearing exhibits are either partially or wholly duplicative of documents already 
admitted during the hearing. (AE O-AE T) For completeness, all of them are marked and admitted.  
 
4 The documents Applicant included with his Answer are AE A through AE F.

 The first two SOR allegations concern Applicant’s state and federal income tax 
returns for tax years 2007-2016, all of which were filed late. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b) Federal 
income tax returns are generally due on or before April 15 of the year following the tax 
year at issue.5 The state income tax return filing deadline for Applicant’s home state is 
generally May 1.6 
 
Applicant filed his 2007 state and federal income tax returns in October 2008. 
Two years later, in October and November 2010, he filed his state and federal income 
tax returns for tax years 2008 and 2009. (AE L, AE M)  
 
For tax years 2007 and 2008, he received state and federal refunds. For tax year 
2009, Applicant owed about $1,700 in federal income taxes. He paid that debt in August 
2011. For tax year 2009, he initially owed $1,212 in state taxes, but that debt has since 
been resolved. (AE L, AE M) 
 
 For tax years 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, Applicant habitually filed his state and 
federal income tax returns four years late (in April 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, 
respectively). He filed his state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 and 
2015 in April and May 2017 (three years late and two years late, respectively). Applicant 
filed his 2016 state and federal income tax returns in July 2017 (about three months 
late). (AE L, AE M) Several of these tax filings were prompted by the Interrogatory, as 
he acknowledged at hearing. (Tr. 68-69; GE 2) 
 
 Applicant’s 2010 federal tax transcript reflects that he requested an extension on 
April 15, 2011, but he did not file that income tax return for three years, until April 2014. 
A $4,452 credit was later transferred to his 2011 taxes. (AE M) Applicant received a 
$747 refund for his 2010 state income taxes. (AE L) 
 
 Applicant’s 2011 federal tax account transcript reflected that in May 2014 (a 
month after he filed his 2010 federal income tax return), the IRS filed a substitute tax 
return on his behalf for the 2011 tax year. He was issued a $13,577 federal tax 
assessment. (AE M) This led to the federal garnishment of his wages. He also had a 
$7,453 in unpaid state income taxes for the same tax year. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d) (GE 1 at 
28; GE 2; GE 3) 
 
After Applicant filed his 2011 income tax returns and was credited with 
appropriate deductions and credits, his tax assessments were recalculated and the 
garnishments were cancelled. He was issued a federal refund of more than $11,000 in 
August 2015, and was due a state refund of $1,031. (Tr. 37-45; GE 1 at 28; GE 2; AE B, 
AE C, AE D, AE F, AE L-AE Q)

 For tax years 2012-2015, Applicant received refunds for both his state and 
federal income tax returns. (AE L, AE M) In October 2017, Applicant paid $121 to the 
IRS in assessed penalties and interest for filing his 2016 federal return after the due 
date. He owed no further balance. (AE M) Applicant initially owed $5,203 in state taxes 
for 2016, though this figure was later adjusted. (AE G, AE L) He submitted 
documentation from the IRS and state tax authorities reflecting that as of October 30, 
2017, he owed no past-due federal or state income tax debt. (AE G) 
 
Applicant’s January 2016 SCA contained the following question:  
 
Taxes: In the past seven (7) years, have you failed to file or pay Federal 
state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?7  
 
In response, Applicant disclosed that he had failed to timely file his 2011 federal 
tax returns. He indicated that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a return on 
his behalf. Applicant then indicated that he filed his 2011 federal return in April 2014, a 
date “which was still before the filing deadline,” he said. (GE 1 at 28).  
 
Applicant did not disclose on his SCA that he had failed to file his 2011 state 
income tax return, though the amount he disclosed ($7,453) was the state tax 
garnishment. He did not disclose that he had other unfiled state or federal income tax 
returns at that time (for tax years 2012, 2013 and 2014). He did not disclose that during 
the past seven years (back to January 2009), he had filed several other income tax 
returns late (tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010). (GE 1 at 28) (Tr. 56-58) 
 
 Both before and during his hearing, Applicant asserted a belief that the section of 
the federal tax code concerning a three-year “limitation on credit or refund”8 allowed him 
three years to file his income tax returns if he expected a refund. (Tr. 36-37, 47-48; GE 
1 at 28; GE 2 at 8, 18-19) Applicant also had concluded, incorrectly, that he could 
operate in a similar manner with his state income tax returns, though he was not able to 
cite to a state law or regulation allowing him to do so. (Tr. 51-53)  
 
However, Applicant also testified, “I did know I was supposed to file taxes on an 
annual basis.” (Tr. 36; see also Tr. 48, 80) Applicant testified that he was “positive” that 
he filed all of his tax returns no more than three years late. (Tr. 74) In fact, for several 
years (2010-2013), he actually filed his state and federal income tax returns four years 
late. (AE L, AE M) He also testified that he did not prepare income tax returns each year 
to verify that he was due a tax refund. (Tr. 49-50) 
 
Applicant disclosed on his SCA that from 2003 to 2015, he also ran a janitorial 
and cleaning franchise. He testified that he was responsible for submitting the tax

returns for the business.9 He did not file the business’s tax returns on time from 2007 to 
2015. (Tr. 76-77; GE 2 at 4) He testified that he filed his business returns when he filed 
his past-due personal income tax returns. He said he carried over business losses to his 
personal tax returns. (Tr. 77-79) Though Applicant’s IRS account transcripts are in the 
record, his tax returns are not.  
 
Applicant used a tax preparer for his business. He acknowledged that she 
“definitely” told him about the annual tax filing deadlines, as well as about the penalties 
he could incur for not filing his tax returns on time. (Tr. 79) Applicant testified, “I did 
know I was supposed to file my taxes on an annual basis.” (Tr. 36, 48, 80) He also 
indicated that he would do so in the future. (Tr. 82-91; Answer)  
 
Applicant also noted during his testimony that he owns real estate. (Tr. 76) In his 
November 2016 background interview, he stated that his assets include eight rental 
properties worth about $600,000 (with a debt or mortgage balance of $440,000). (GE 2 
at 18) The details about these properties, including their tax implications, were not 
explored at hearing.  
 
Applicant earns an annual salary of about $90,000 in his job at the shipyard. His 
wife is in the social work field. He indicated that he and his wife are financially stable. 
(Tr. 87-88)  
 
Applicant volunteers in his community as a coach and tutor. (Tr. 23-25; GE 1 at 
11; AE A) Co-workers and friends attested consistently to his reliability, honesty, 
trustworthiness, and to his leadership skills. (AE A) 
 
Policies 
 
 It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the 
Supreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of 
denials.”10 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the 
factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching 
                                                          
9 Tr. 76. (“It was a franchise, so [the central franchise office] would just send you paperwork, or send you 
the money via check, and then you are responsible for doing your taxes.”)

adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 
2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as 
the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.” In reaching this decision, I 
have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the 
evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on 
mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, an “applicant is 
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the 
ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.” 
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Analysis 
  
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
 
7 
 
 
The guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns 
under AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   
 
 (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or 
failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.  
 
Applicant failed to timely file his annual state and federal income tax returns for 
10 years, from 2007 to 2016, as required. AG ¶ 19(f) applies. In 2015, his wages were 
garnished by state tax authorities and the IRS after they filed past-due tax returns on his 
behalf. Though he later filed those returns and the garnishments were ultimately 
resolved, AG ¶ 19(c) nonetheless applies.  
 
 Conditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.  
 
Applicant has been employed in the defense industry, and has held a security 
clearance, for about 20 years. He has an MBA, and owns numerous rental properties. 
Until 2015, he also ran his own janitorial and cleaning service. He utilized a tax preparer 
for his businesses, and he acknowledged that she reminded him about the annual tax 
filing requirements and deadlines. For 10 years, as recently as for tax year 2016, 
Applicant consistently filed his state and federal personal income tax returns late.11 He 
has essentially no current track record of compliance with tax filing requirements.  
                                                          
11 I cannot consider Applicant’s failure to timely file his business tax returns as disqualifying conduct, since 
that is not alleged in the SOR. However, I can consider that conduct in weighing mitigation or changed 
circumstances, whether Applicant has demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation, under the whole person 
concept, and in weighing Applicant’s credibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  
 
8 
 
 
Applicant initially claimed that had a right under the federal tax code to file his 
federal income tax returns three years after the annual deadline as long as he was due 
a refund. This was wrong, as was his assumption that he had a similar right under state 
law. As the Appeal Board has noted, Applicant’s argument “regarding the three-year 
statute of limitation for claiming a tax refund is unfounded. The three-year statute of 
limitation is not a grant of a filing extension, but only a limitation on filing a refund.”12 
Additionally, Applicant also filed several of his income tax returns more than three years 
late. He also did not prepare annual income tax returns to verify whether he was due a 
refund. Perhaps most tellingly, he also repeatedly acknowledged at hearing that he 
knew he had to file his income tax returns on an annual basis.  
 
 All of this evidence leads to the conclusion that Applicant’s pattern of repeated 
non-compliance with annual income tax filing requirements was due to his repeated and 
knowing disregard for rules and regulations, and for his responsibilities as a taxpayer 
under the law. AG ¶ 20(b) does not apply.  
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. 
Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for 
protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is 
not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 
(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards 
inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at 
evaluating an applicant’s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails 
repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the 
high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted 
access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 
(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union 
Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 
886 (1961).13 
 
It is also appropriate to consider the fact that Applicant was not fully candid on 
his January 2016 SCA in disclosing his unfiled returns. He addressed only tax year 
2011, noting that his wages had been garnished. At the time, however, he had several 
other years of unfiled state and federal income tax returns, several of which were not 
resolved until later in 2016, or in 2017. The fact that Applicant significantly under-
reported the true extent of his unfiled tax returns undercuts the credibility of his

13 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). See ISCR Case No. 14-
05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).

testimony, his assertions that he will file his tax returns in a timely manner in the future, 
and of his overall willingness to follow rules and regulations.14 
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017), the Appeal Board 
held that timing of an applicant’s resolution of his tax filing problems is relevant in 
evaluating an applicant's case for mitigation. An applicant who resolves financial or tax 
problems only when his clearance might be imperiled raises questions about his 
willingness to follow the sometimes complex rules governing classified information when 
his personal interests are not at stake. Here, Applicant filed his 2011 state and federal 
income tax returns after his wages were garnished by the IRS and state tax authorities. 
He filed several of his tax returns in April and May 2017, following receipt of an 
interrogatory.  
 
The garnishments (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) related to a single tax year and were 
quickly resolved once Applicant filed the income tax returns at issue. However, since 
they also relate directly to Applicant’s overall pattern of conduct. I therefore cannot 
mitigate those allegations solely because the debts are resolved. 
 
 Similarly, given both the length and recency of his track record, Applicant has not 
established that his tax issues are unlikely to recur, or that they no longer cast doubt on 
his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG ¶ 20(a) does not apply.  
 
 Applicant has now filed the past-due state and federal returns alleged in the 
SOR. He documented that he owes no outstanding past-due state or federal taxes. 
However, he repeatedly filed his tax returns late, and often several years late. I cannot 
simply adopt a position of “no harm, no foul” or “all’s well that ends well.”15 Applicant 
has not established a track record of steady, timely, good-faith compliance with the 
requirements to file annual state and federal income tax returns. AG ¶ 20(d) therefore 
does not apply. Similarly, the mere fact that Applicant made belated arrangements with 
appropriate authorities to file his income tax returns is insufficient to apply AG ¶ 20(g). 
Moreover, even if AG ¶ 20(g) applied, Applicant’s eligibility for a clearance does not turn 
on the application of one mitigating condition.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
                                                          
14 ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017). Applicant’s lack of candor on his SCA about 
the full extent of his tax issues was not alleged in the SOR, but I can consider that evidence in weighing 
his credibility. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).

(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the 
potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and 
circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I credit Applicant’s long career in the defense 
industry. He also provides value to his community as a volunteer coach and tutor. 
Applicant was also remorseful for his misconduct. However, I cannot ignore the record 
evidence of his consistent failure to timely file his annual state and federal income tax 
returns over a ten-year period. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions 
and doubts as to Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:
