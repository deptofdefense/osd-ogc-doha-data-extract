LEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant contests the Defense Department’s intent to deny his eligibility for 
access to classified information. He failed to timely file state income tax returns for tax 
years 2008 through 2014. He likewise failed to timely file federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. Taken together, these matters reflect a recent or 
recurring pattern of irresponsibility, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules 
and regulations. He filed the past-due returns with the IRS in April 2016 and with the 
state in April 2017, and he is now in compliance with both tax authorities. Nevertheless, 
it is too soon to tell if his long-standing pattern of behavior is a thing of the past or is a 
firmly established part of his character. Accordingly, this case is decided against 
Applicant.    
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security 
Positions (SF 86 format) on December 4, 2015.1 This document is commonly known as

a security clearance application. Thereafter, on October 23, 2016, after reviewing the 
application and the information gathered during a background investigation, the 
Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent 
Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified 
information. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the 
action under the security guideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   
 
Applicant answered the SOR on November 16, 2016. He admitted that he had 
yet to file his state income tax returns, but had in fact filed his federal income tax returns 
for the various tax years in question. He requested a decision based on the written 
record in lieu of a hearing. Subsequently, in April 2017, he retained counsel and 
requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  
 
The case was assigned to me on May 1, 2017. The hearing took place as 
scheduled on July 11, 2017. Applicant appeared with counsel. Both Department 
Counsel and Applicant offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 
1-2 and A-Y, respectively. The record was kept open to allow Applicant an opportunity 
to submit additional documentary matters, and those matters are admitted without 
objections as Exhibits Z and AA. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on July 19, 
2017. 
 
  Findings of Fact 
 
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security clearance 
previously granted to him in 2007. His educational background includes a master’s 
degree in mechanical engineering.2 He is employed as a principal manufacturing 
engineer for a large defense contractor, and his total compensation for 2017 was about 
$132,000.3 His work involves bringing the latest automation technology to the 
company’s factories and training engineers how to use it. He has a good employment 
record, which includes obtaining an U.S. patent.4 A co-worker appeared as a witness at 
the hearing and described Applicant as a person who is beyond reproach, who follows 
rules, who acts as a mentor and shares his knowledge, and who is the first person to 
arrive at work and the last to leave.  
 
In his December 2015 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he 
had failed to timely file state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2014, and 
had failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014.5 
He explained his failure was due to a series of life events (primarily, his wife’s serious 
health problems), he usually withheld more than he owed in tax resulting in refund, and

he hoped that he would get caught up by the end of Christmas break (2015). He 
provided additional information about his tax problems during his July 2016 background 
investigation.6 He explained that the life events were a combination of work 
responsibilities and the demands of serving as the only caregiver to his wife, who was 
suffering with chronic and severe health problems. He noted that his wife had handled 
the tax matters in the past before her health problems arose. He stated that he had filed 
his past-due federal returns in March 2016 and planned to file the past-due state returns 
by October 2016.  
 
At the hearing, Applicant provided additional detail about the health problems 
experienced by his wife over a number of years.7 They included chronic and debilitating 
migraine headaches, depression, and two heart attacks followed by bypass surgery. 
Her condition has improved, and she is now off all pain medication for the first time in 
years. Applicant acknowledged that he has been diagnosed with and is being treated for 
adult attention-deficit disorder, which may have a connection to his failure to timely file 
the tax returns.8 He further attributed his delay in filing to an inability to locate paperwork 
to support comprehensive returns. He finally resolved that issue when he decided to 
take the standard deduction and file the returns. He stated that he was previously 
unaware of the potential serious consequences of failure to timely file tax returns and is 
now highly motivated to make certain that he completes them on time.9 He is confident 
that this behavior will not recur because it’s not a place he wants to be, he has made it a 
priority, and his wife’s improved health is also a positive factor.10 In addition, he 
submitted a signed statement of intent wherein he pledged that he would never fail to 
pay his income taxes when due.11 
 
Applicant’s documentation establishes that he resolved the federal tax problem in 
2016. IRS account transcripts for the last five tax years show that he failed to timely file 
federal tax returns for 2012, 2013, and 2014, and that he timely filed returns for 2015 
and 2016.12 The past-due returns were filed in April 2016, and he received refunds of 
about $2,700 for each tax year. The returns for 2015 and 2016 were timely filed in April 
2016 and April 2017, and he received refunds of about $2,700 for both years. The IRS 
account transcripts show $0 balances for all five tax years.

Applicant’s documentation establishes that he resolved the state tax problem in 
2017. He filed the past-due returns for tax years 2008 through 2014 in April 2017.13 He 
then discovered the option of entering into a voluntary disclosure agreement with the 
state tax authority to resolve outstanding tax matters.14 He entered into an agreement in 
June 2017 to address liability for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016; the agreement 
did not require him to file income tax returns for tax years ending before 2013.15 Per the 
agreement, he paid $4,253 in June 2017 for all tax liability.16 After that payment, on July 
14, 2017, he paid $245 for interest, and he received a certificate of compliance and 
letter of good standing establishing that he has filed all returns and paid all taxes due 
with the state tax authority as of August 10, 2017.17  
 
Other than the tax problems, Applicant’s overall financial situation appears to be 
stable.18 For example, a personal financial statement shows a monthly net remainder of 
about $1,300, and he had more than $22,000 in checking accounts.  
 
Law and Policies 
 
 This case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding 
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of 
Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security 
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or 
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.19 
 
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.20 As 
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent 
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the 
side of denials.”21 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt 
about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be 
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that

the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.22 The Appeal Board has 
followed the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the 
substantial-evidence standard.23 
 
 A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted 
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.24 An 
unfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing 
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.25 
 
 There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for 
access to classified information.26 The Government has the burden of presenting 
evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.27 An 
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate 
facts that have been admitted or proven.28 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate 
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.29 
 
Discussion 
 
 Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may 
be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive 
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: 
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . .30 
 
 The concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of 
value. It encompasses concerns about a person’s self-control, judgment, and other

important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive 
information. 
 
 In analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and 
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:  
 
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  
 
AG ¶ 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local 
income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income 
tax as required;  
 
 AG ¶ 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or 
separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity 
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and   
 
AG ¶ 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.   
 
 The evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a problematic financial 
history sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. That history is 
established by his failure to timely file state and federal income tax returns for multiple 
tax years during 2008-2014. He is now in compliance with the state and federal tax 
authorities as of August 2017 and April 2016, respectively. Given these circumstances, 
the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(g) applies in Applicant’s favor. In addition, I 
considered the mitigating condition at AG ¶ 20(b), but it does not apply in Applicant’s 
favor because he has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. Without doubt, he 
faced a demanding situation. His preoccupation with work and caring for his wife is 
understandable and reasonable. Under these circumstances, I am usually inclined to 
grant anyone some leeway (e.g., one to two years) in meeting their tax obligations. But 
the problem here extended over many years because Applicant allowed it to snowball.   
 
 The failure to timely file tax returns and pay tax when due bears close 
examination and is a matter of serious concern to the federal government.31 The nexus 
or security significance between Applicant’s behavior and his eligibility for access to 
classified information was explained by the Appeal Board as follows: 
 
Security requirements include consideration of a person’s judgment, 
reliability, and a sense of [their] legal obligations. Failure to comply with 
                                                          
31 The General Accountability Office (GAO) expressed serious concern over the relationship between tax 
delinquents and clearance holders in its July 28, 2014 report, Security Clearances: Tax Debts Owed by 
DOD Employees and Contractors, http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665052.pdf.

federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem 
with abiding by well-established government rules and regulations. 
Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting 
classified information.32  
 
That is the situation here. Applicant did not voluntarily comply with his lawful obligation 
to timely file tax returns for a period of several years. He only recently came into 
compliance with the IRS in April 2016 and with the state tax authority in August 2017. 
His behavior is a serious concern because his needless delay or procrastination in the 
serious business of tax reporting may easily carry over into lapses in the serious 
business of properly handling and safeguarding classified information.  
 
 To sum up, the record evidence shows Applicant has a well-established history 
of failing to meet his lawful tax obligations. Although he is now in compliance with both 
federal and state tax authorities, it is too soon to tell if his long-standing pattern of 
behavior is a thing of the past or is a firmly established part of his character. Taken 
together, his tax problems reflect a recent or recurring pattern of irresponsibility, lack of 
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. In reaching this 
conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence 
outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person 
concept. On that point, I gave Applicant credit for voluntarily reporting the information 
about his tax problems. Applicant also impressed me as a sincere, dedicated, and hard-
working employee who enjoys his job. Nevertheless, I conclude that he did not meet his 
ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national 
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
