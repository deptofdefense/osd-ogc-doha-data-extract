KEYWORD: Guideline F
DIGEST: The mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment arrangement
with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to issue a favorable decision.  As with
the application of any mitigating condition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and
decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  The
timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to consider in the application of
mitigating conditions. Adverse decision affirmed.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Ryan C. Nerney, Esq.
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance.  On June
17, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department of
Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a decision
on the written record.  On December 1, 2017, after considering the record, Defense Office of
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant’s request
for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶ E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue  on appeal:  whether the Judge’s adverse decision was
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact  
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a Federal contractor.  She began working for her
current employer in late 2015.  She failed to file tax returns as required.  She filed her Federal
income tax returns for 2011-2013 in February and April 2015 and those for 2014-2016 in June 
2017.  Her reasons for those tax filing deficiencies included unemployment, an employer’s failure
to withhold taxes, and paperwork problems. 
The IRS withheld Applicant’s 2016 tax refund to resolve her 2010 tax deficiency.  She has
an installment agreement with the IRS for a 2011 tax deficiency for which she makes payments of
$500 monthly.  She also submitted details for an online payment agreement for 2014.  The balance
for both years was about $11,700.  Although not clear from the record, it appears Applicant also
owes taxes for 2012 and 2013.
 Applicant has two judgments against her that are not satisfied, but she is working with a debt
relief program to settle them.   She is current on her student loans and settled parking tickets.  She
spoke to the creditor about an unresolved collection account, but the creditor could not find the
account.
In 2010, Applicant became self-employed and had little to no income from 2010 to 2012. 
Her home was foreclosed in 2012.  Her salary, however, has increased to $130,000 and she can pay
her bill.  Her total outstanding debt is about $24,500.  She received financial counseling through the
debt relief program.  She was aware of her debts since her background interview in 2016 and only
recently settled some of them.  
 
The Judge’s Analysis
Applicant did not file some of her delinquent tax returns until after issuance of the SOR,
which reduces the mitigative value of such remedial action.  She did not submit evidence showing
her tax filing deficiencies are unlikely to recur.  She took corrective action after her job was placed
in jeopardy.  She partially established mitigating condition 20(g),1 but did not establish any of the
other mitigating conditions.  She failed to meet her burden of persuasion.    
Discussion
Applicant notes the Judge cited Appeal Board decisions that applied the previous version of
the adjudicative guidelines and do not address mitigating condition 20(g), which appears for the first
1 Directive, Encl., App. A. ¶ 20(g) states, “the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.”

time in the guidelines that became effective on June 8, 2017.  She argues that the Judge’s reliance
on those decisions “makes her analysis [of the] tax allegations erroneous.”  Appeal Brief at 4.  In
principle, Applicant’s argument raises an important concern.  The Board has previously noted that
the “precedential value of Board decisions is affected to the extent those decisions involve
interpretation of a provision of the Directive that is later revised or changed.”2  However, in this
case, Applicant has failed to identify any particular quote or proposition in the cited cases that no
longer has any precedential value due to changes in the guidelines.  We are unaware of what
concepts in those prior decisions that Applicant is now challenging.  Accordingly, this particular
assignment of error fails for lack of specificity.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-06691 at 3 (App. Bd.
May 16, 2011).  To the extent that Applicant is arguing that all prior Appeal Board decisions
involving tax cases are no longer of any precedential value solely due to the recent addition of
mitigating condition 20(g), we do not find such an overbroad argument persuasive. 
Applicant contends that the Judge erred in her analysis of mitigating condition 20(g).  In her
argument, Applicant notes that she filed her delinquent tax returns and entered into a payment
agreement with the IRS.  She also points out that mitigating condition 20(g) “has no reference to
when or how long an [applicant] needs to establish an arrangement with the appropriate tax
authority.”  Appeal Brief at 5.  The mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a
payment arrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to issue a favorable
2 See, ISCR Case No. 06-23453 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2007).  The complete paragraph reads as follows:
The validity of Appeal Board precedent issued under earlier editions of the Adjudicative
Guidelines is an issue in this case.  The Board has previously held “. . . a Judge cannot rely on
language from an earlier version of the Directive to justify the Judge’s decision and that an applicant’s
security eligibility must be adjudicated under current DoD policies and standards, not past ones.
Similarly, the precedential value of Board decisions is affected to the extent those decisions involve
the interpretation of a provision of the Directive that is later revised or changed. Statements made by
the Board in earlier decisions that are predicated on then-existing language in the Directive cannot be
simply assumed—by a Judge or a party— to be applicable in later cases after the pertinent provision(s)
of the Directive have been revised or changed.” See ISCR Case No. 02-17369 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May
23, 2006); and ISCR Case No. 02-24254 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jun 29, 2004) (footnotes omitted).  Of
course, some precedent remains completely valid in the face of changes to the guidelines, because it
is not dependent on the language of any specific guideline.  Other precedent remains valid where the
applicable language of the guideline is unchanged or the changes are not of sufficient magnitude to
vitiate or overrule the substance of the precedent.  However, Board decisions cannot be relied on or
followed to the extent they involve precedent predicated on law or DoD policy that changed after the
issuance of those decisions.  Quasi-judicial adjudications must be made within the bounds of
applicable law and agency policy, not without regard to them. See, e.g., Croplife America v.
Environmental Protection Agency, 329 F.3d 876, 882 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (administrative law judges
cannot ignore agency policy in making rulings); Nash v. Bowen, 869 F.2d 675, 680 (2d Cir.
1989)(administrative law judge is subordinate to head of agency or department in matters of policy);
Mullen v. Bowen, 800 F.2d 535, 540 n. 5 (6th Cir. 1986) (decisional independence does not relieve
administrative law judge of the obligation to apply agency policy).  See  ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 
3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)(security clearance decisions must be based on current DoD policy and
standards).  Accordingly, no Board decision should be construed or interpreted without regard to the
law and DoD policy applicable at the time the Board decision was issued.

decision.  As with the application of any mitigating condition, the Judge must examine the record
evidence and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice
versa.  The timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to consider in the
application of mitigating condition 20(g) as well as in considering aspects of other overlapping
mitigating conditions, such as, in determining whether an applicant acted responsibly under the
circumstances, whether an applicant’s past financial deficiencies are unlikely to recur,3 or whether
an applicant initiated good-faith efforts to resolve financial problems.4  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-
06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) for a case decided under the new adjudicative guidelines that
addresses the significance of timing in the resolution of tax problems.5  In the present case, the Judge
concluded that Applicant filed some delinquent tax returns after the SOR was issued, which reduced
the mitigative value of such remedial action.  From our review of the record, we conclude that
Applicant failed to establish that the Judge’s weighing of the evidence in general or, more
specifically, her analysis under mitigating condition 20(g) was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to
law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-00276 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct 30, 2017).  
Applicant also argues that the Judge did not consider all relevant evidence.  She cites to such
matters as her unemployment, her payment arrangement with the IRS, and her efforts to resolve
other debts, which included obtaining assistance from a debt relief company.  The Judge, however,
made findings about those matters.  Applicant’s arguments are not sufficient to rebut the
presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-
00257 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2017).  We gave due consideration to the Hearing Office case that
Applicant cited, but it is neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to undermine
the Judge’s decision.  Id. 
The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the
decision.  A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax
returns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and
reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-
08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017).  The decision is sustainable on this record.  “The general
standard is that a clearance may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests of the
national security.’”  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  See also Directive,
Encl. 2, App A ¶ 2(b):  “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
3 In this case, the Judge also noted that Applicant had  yet to file a Federal income tax return in a timely manner
since 2010, which supported her conclusion that Applicant has not established that her tax filing deficiencies are unlikely
to recur.    
4  We note that mitigating condition 20(d) (the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay
overdue creditor or otherwise resolve debts) also has no specified time element.  Yet, the Appeal Board has long held
that the timing of the resolution of debts is an important factor for the Judge to consider.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-
12862 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2005) and ISCR Case No. 11-13949 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 5, 2013).  
5 See, ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 18, 2015) for a general discussion of the significance
of timing in resolving tax problems.
