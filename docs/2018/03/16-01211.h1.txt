TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant mitigated security concerns pertaining to Guideline F (financial 
consideration). Clearance is granted.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On January 26, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National 
Security Positions (SF-86). On September 15, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to 
Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information 
within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and the Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, which became 
effective on September 1, 2006 (Sept. 1, 2006 AGs).  
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security 
clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to 
determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline.

On October 14, 2016, Applicant answered the SOR. On December 20, 2016, 
Department Counsel was prepared to proceed. On April 25, 2017, the Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On May 18, 2017, DOHA issued 
a notice of the hearing, setting the hearing on June 13, 2017. The hearing was held as 
scheduled.  
 
At the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 
6, which were received into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered 
Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F, which were received without objection. I held the 
record open until July 28, 2017, to afford Applicant the opportunity to submit additional 
evidence. Applicant timely submitted AE G, which was received without objection. On 
June 21, 2017, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.). 
 
While this case was pending a decision, the Director of National Intelligence issued 
Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing National Security Adjudicative 
Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to 
Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs) which he made applicable to all covered individuals who 
require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold 
a sensitive position. The new AGs supersede the Sept. 1, 2006 AGs and are effective “for 
all covered individuals” on or after June 8, 2017. Accordingly, I have evaluated Applicant’s 
security clearance eligibility under the new AGs, as required.1 
 
Findings of Fact2 
 
 Applicant did not specifically admit or deny the sole SOR allegation, but rather 
provided an explanation with attachments. Accordingly, I am treating his narrative 
response as an admission. Additional findings of fact follow. 
 
Background Information 
 
Applicant is a 65-year-old senior logistics analyst employed by a defense 
contractor since December 2013. (Tr. 14-15) He seeks to retain his secret security 
clearance which is a requirement of his continued employment. Since 1974, Applicant 
has successfully held a security clearance at various levels to include a top secret security 
clearance with access to sensitive compartmented information. (Tr. 17-18, 25) 
 
Applicant graduated from high school in 1971. He was awarded a bachelor of 
science degree in chemistry in 1975, and was awarded a master of science degree in 
management in 1989. See Applicant’s resume for additional course work and service 
schools. (Tr. 15-16, 40-43; AE C) Applicant served in the U.S. Army from 1976 to 1997, 
and retired with an honorable discharge as a lieutenant colonel (pay grade O-5). (Tr. 16, 
20-21; AE C) Following his Army career, he was employed primarily in the defense 
                                            
1 The new AGs are available at http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/SEAD4 20170608.pdf.  
 
2 Some details were excluded to protect Applicant’s right to privacy. Specific information is available 
in the cited exhibits. 
 
 
3 
                                         
 
industry in the private or public sectors. (Tr. 22-25; AE C) Applicant married in 1978 and 
divorced in 2000. He remarried in 2005, and has two adult stepdaughters. Applicant’s 
wife had a successful banking career in a management positions, and no longer works 
outside the home. (Tr. 16-17, 28-29, 38-39, 57-58; AE E) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
The SOR alleges a sole allegation under this concern, a 2013 $54,507 Federal tax 
lien. This tax lien arose from Applicant’s failure to file his Federal tax returns from 2002 
to 2005. (Tr. 18-20) This allegation was established through Applicant’s admission and 
the evidence presented. (SOR answer; GE 1-5) 
 
During this timeframe, Applicant was in the midst of a very contentious and costly 
divorce, and he lost his mother, father, grandmother, and brother-in-law.  Moreover, while 
all of this was going on, he was doing his level best to stay focused on a demanding 
defense-related job that involved a daily three-hour commute. The cumulative effect of 
these factors caused his health to suffer and led him to a state of depression and anxiety 
and “things just slipped.”  (SOR answer; Tr. 26-28, 56-57) 
 
Upon receipt of the IRS tax lien, Applicant hired a tax relief firm (TRF). He sent the 
TRF all requested documents and a $3,950 fee. In January 2014, the TRF notified 
Applicant that the IRS closed out his account as currently not collectible for tax years 
2000 to 2005. The TRF explained that the IRS deemed Applicant unable to pay the debt 
and notified him that they were closing his file. Applicant hired the TRF because he 
wanted “complete closure with everything resolved and finalized.” The TRF company 
president informed him that he need not be concerned because the statute of limitations 
would run out before the IRS could take any further action. That information proved to be 
incorrect and led to a falling out between the TRF and Applicant. (SOR answer; Tr. 28-
30, 43-46, 48-50) 
 
As of May 2016, the IRS had recalculated the amount Applicant owed to be 
$35,370. After his fallout with the TRF, Applicant worked directly with the IRS. To avoid a 
levy against all of his income, Applicant paid the IRS $2,891 reducing the amount owed 
to $32,749. He set up a payment plan and is paying the IRS $1,600 monthly by direct 
debit. In addition to the monthly payment by direct debit, Applicant paid $4,600 to the IRS 
in October 2016. As of October 2016, the amount owed to the IRS had been reduced to 
$27,880. (SOR answer; Tr. 30, 46-48, 50-52, 55-56)  
 
Although Applicant set up a payment plan, he challenged the 30% tax rate the IRS 
assessed him for tax years 2002 to 2005 claiming that he was historically assessed a tax 
rate at 18-20%. The higher assessment was apparently based on Applicant’s filing status 
being listed as married filed separately when he should have been listed as single. 
Applicant was unaware that his filing status was incorrect. While continuing to make 
monthly payments, Applicant plans to appeal the penalties assessed, the applied tax rate, 
and statute of limitations issue. (SOR answer; Tr. 33- 35; AE F) As of his hearing, 
Applicant had reduced his debt to the IRS to about $16,139. (Tr. 31-32, 32-36, 48, 53-54; 
AE A) 
 
4 
                                         
 
Applicant has not missed filing his tax returns since 2004. He is current on all of 
his debts and his credit score is 783. Should Applicant be unsuccessful in challenging his 
tax arrearage, he has the means to continue making his agreed payments. (Tr. 36-37; AE 
B, AE F) He is happily married, and the marital discord and personal tragedies he 
experienced in the past are behind him. Applicant leads a lifestyle consistent with his 
income level. (Tr. 37-39, 52-53, 57; AE D) Post-hearing, Applicant provided 
documentation that he filed his 2002 to 2005 Federal tax returns. (Tr. 58-59; AE G) 
 
Character Evidence 
 
 Applicant submitted a detailed resume that documents over 40 years of service in 
support of the national defense, initially as a career Army officer and later as a defense 
contractor and a Government employee. He received the highest ratings possible on his 
recent performance evaluations. (Tr. 39, 54-55; AE C)  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
 
5 
                                         
 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) 
(citation omitted) as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
 
6 
                                         
 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts;”  “(c) a history of not 
meeting financial obligations;” and “(f) failure to . . . to pay annual Federal . . . income tax 
as required.”  
 
Applicant did not pay his Federal income taxes for tax years 2002 to 2005 that led 
to a $54,507 tax lien. Based on this and other information in the SOR, the record 
established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring 
additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
AG ¶ 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
AG ¶¶ 20(d), (e) and (g) are fully applicable. When Applicant realized that he had 
tax issues, he retained the services of a TRF, but unfortunately, they failed to solve his 
IRS tax problems. Following this failed effort, Applicant chose to deal directly with the IRS 
 
7 
                                         
 
and entered into an agreement to pay them $1,600 a month. He is making that payment 
through direct debit and as of his hearing had reduced a debt that started out at $54,507 
to $16,139. Applicant is committed to resolving this debt, has a plan in place, and has the 
means to continue monthly payments to the IRS until this debt is paid. Applicant is current 
on his other debts, lives within his means, and has an excellent credit rating.  
 
Failure to file Federal tax returns and failure to pay annual Federal income tax is a 
serious security concern. Under these facts, application of AG ¶ 20(a) initially appears 
limited because there are multiple income tax returns at issue and repayment of taxes is 
ongoing. Applicant is aware of his obligations to remain current on his Federal income 
taxes. Apart from this four-year tax filing gap, he has never failed to file his tax returns 
before or since. Consequently, I find AG ¶ 20(a) applies. Moreover, Applicant is genuinely 
contrite over his laxity and oversight. He has taken the appropriate corrective action. 
Evidence of his Federal tax return filings was introduced. Applicant’s tax situation is now 
under control.  
 
 Applicant fell behind on filing his Federal tax returns for four years, primarily 
because of a plethora of personal problems. The DOHA Appeal Board has commented: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR 
Case No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The 
Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly 
corrected [the applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of [a]pplicant’s security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior 
evidencing irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See 
ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016)  
 
In ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016), the Appeal Board 
reversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant 
disqualifying facts:  
 
8 
                                         
 
Applicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and 
received a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in 
September 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He 
received Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. 
 
Notwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed when the tax returns were filed in ISCR 
Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board provided the following 
principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance, “By failing to file his 
2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, Applicant did not 
demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted 
access to classified information.” ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2016) 
(citations omitted). 
  
On June 8, 2017, the new AGs went into effect.  In 2016, Applicant “made 
arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file [all required federal income tax 
returns] . . . and is in compliance with those arrangements.” AG ¶ 20(g). Based on 
consideration of his credibility, contrition, and new understanding of his responsibilities, 
there is sufficient assurance that his financial problems are being resolved, are under 
control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the circumstances, financial 
considerations security concerns are mitigated. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a security 
clearance “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration” 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is a 65-year-old senior logistics analyst who has been employed by a 
defense contractor since December 2013. He has worked in support of the national 
defense over 40 years and has successfully held a security clearance to include top secret 
with access to sensitive compartmented information during that entire timeframe. His 
 
9 
                                         
 
civilian employer noted his excellent performance and the contribution he is making 
toward the national defense.  
 
Shortly after the IRS contacted Applicant about his tax issues, he sought 
professional help with the TRF. When the TRF failed to obtain the desired results, 
Applicant chose to deal directly with the IRS and set up a payment plan. He is not proud 
of his delay in filing required tax returns and it is clear that that this failure in an otherwise 
stellar record of lifetime service, will not happen again. This process has had a sobering 
effect on Applicant and I am confident that he will endeavor to file timely his tax returns in 
the future. 
  
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, and the new 
AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that 
financial consideration security concerns are mitigated.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a:    For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.
