 Decision
  ______________
WESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:
Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant  
failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding her financial considerations. Eligibility
for access to classified information is denied.
 
Statement of Case
On November 4, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons
why DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a
security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine
whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The
action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified
Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6,
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as
amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on
September 1, 2006.  
The Security Executive Agent, by Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative
Guidelines (SEAD 4), dated December 10, 2016, superceded and replaced the
September 2006 adjudicative guidelines (AGs). They apply to all covered individuals
who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility
to hold a sensitive position. Procedures for administrative due process for contractor
personnel continue to be governed by DOD Directive 5220.6, subject to the updated
substantive changes in the AGs, effective June 8, 2017. Application of the AGs that
were in effect when the SOR was issued would not affect my decision in this case.
Applicant responded to the SOR on December 25, 2016, and requested a hearing. 
The case was assigned to me on June 5, 2017, and scheduled for hearing on August 3,
2017. The Government’s case consisted of five exhibits (GEs 1-5). Applicant relied on 
one witness (herself) and 28 exhibits. (AEs A-BB) The transcript was received on August
15, 2017.
Procedural Issues
Before the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to
permit her the opportunity to supplement the record with (a) documented filing of her
federal tax returns for tax years 2005-2008 and 2011-2013; (b) an IRS payment
summary; and (c) Applicant requests for removal of federal tax liens covering tax years
2014-2016. return. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement
the record. Department Counsel was afforded seven days to respond.
Within the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with (a) federal
income tax documentation regarding Applicant’s proof of filing her federal tax returns,
proof of tax payments; (b) state tax documentation of proof of payments; (c) federal
student loan documentation; and (d) a salary review statement covering a salary
increase. Applicant’s submissions were admitted without objection as AEs CC-FF.
Summary of Pleadings
Under Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) incurred federal tax liens for tax years
2014-2016 exceeding $154,000 in the aggregate; (b) accumulated delinquent mortgage
debts of $11,631 on a $177,458 mortgage balance; (c) accumulated delinquent federally
guaranteed student loans exceeding $22,000; and (d) accumulated delinquent consumer
debts exceeding $3,000. Applicant’s delinquent debts remain unresolved and
outstanding.
In her response to the SOR, Applicant denied each of the allegations with
explanations. She claimed the allegations made against her do not define who she is as a
person. She claimed she is making a good-faith effort to correct all of the financial issues.
She claimed she is a trustworthy person and completely understands the responsibility
and obligations while holding a security clearance.
In July 2017, Department Counsel amended the SOR to add subparagraph 1.o as
follows: On various occasions, Applicant failed to timely file her annual tax returns as
2
required for tax years 2005-2013. In her response to the amendment, Applicant denied
the allegations.
      Findings of Fact
Applicant is a 55-year-old master test engineer for a defense contractor who seeks
a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR were not admitted by Applicant
and are reserved for fact-finding based on the developed evidence at hearing. 
Background
Applicant married in June 1997 and divorced in September 2002. (GEs 1-2) She 
has no children from this marriage and two adult children from prior relationships. (GEs 1-
2 and AE O; Tr. 26-27) She attended on-line college classes between August 2007 and
December 2008 and since August 2014, but has not, to date, earned a degree or
diploma. (GEs 1-2) Applicant enlisted in the Navy Inactive Reserve in 2000 and was
recalled to active duty from November 2001 to September 2003. (GEs 1-2) She returned
to the Navy reserve in 2003 and served for five years before she separated in May 2008.
Applicant received her honorable discharge for both her reserve and active duty service in
May 2008.  (GE 1; Tr. 48-49) She currently draws Veterans Affairs (VA) disability benefits
of $550 a month. (Tr. 48-49)
Since October 2014, Applicant has worked for her current defense contractor.
(GEs 1-2) Between June 2009 and September 2014, she worked for another employer as
a senior software test engineer. While employed for this contractor, she started her own
consulting firm, which she operated continuously between May 2014 and September
2014. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 51-52) Between March 2004 and June 2009, she worked for a
defense contractor as software engineer. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 51)
Applicant’s finances
Tax records confirm that Applicant failed to timely file her federal income tax
returns for tax years 2005-2013. (GEs 1-2 and 5; Tr. 53-62) She attributed her filing
lapses and debt delinquencies to health issues marked by various surgeries over a
number of years (2004, 2006, and 2015-2016). Her medical records document surgical
procedures to address elevated blood pressure and diagnosed bilateral mid-renal artery
secular aneurysms. (AE BB) Her listed surgeries include a 2006 hammer toe repair, an
abdominoplasty in 2014, a hysterectomy in 2015, and a renal artery aneurysm repair in
2016. Some of her  surgeries required brief hospital stays; while others were administered
on an outpatient basis. (AE MM) 
How Applicant’s multiple surgeries affected her ability to work is not clear. (AE BB)
She claims to have incurred severe income reductions (from $100,000 to $40,000) that
materially affected her ability to manage her finances. (Tr. 44) Still, she offered few
excuses for her late-filing of her returns for tax years 2005-2013. She did cite to her loss
of tax records for 2005 as the result of flooding associated with Hurricane Katrina and her
3
ensuing relocation. (AE P; Tr. 40-41) This forced her to prepare substitute tax records for
use in filing her 2005 federal tax returns. (AE P; Tr. 40-43)
From the documentation produced by Applicant, it is not fully clear when she filed
her federal tax returns for tax years 2005-2013. She indicated in her testimony that she
filed her returns for these years in 2013 and 2014, albeit without any corroboration to
substantiate her assurances. (Tr. 55-63) Her most recent tax preparer confirmed only that
his firm filed her federal returns for tax years 2005-2016; he did not specify the dates of
filing her respective returns for these years. (AEs H and CC) Without IRS transcripts to
work with, exact filing dates cannot be determined. Nor can it be reliably determined
whether the IRS approved her late-filed returns without imposed penalties and interest.
So, while Applicant may be credited with filing her federal returns for tax years 2005-
2013, they cannot be considered either timely nor IRS approved without additional
penalties and interest. 
Between 2009 and 2015, Applicant retained a number of tax preparers to file her
federal and state income tax returns. Beginning in January 2009, she retained a small
firm (firm A) to file her 2005-2007 returns. (AE G) Firm A provided a list of information
requests for Applicant to address. While it is not clear what information Applicant provided
firm A, he apparently never completed and filed her federal tax returns for the 2005-2007
tax years. In January 2013, Applicant retained another firm (firm B) to file her 2009-2010
federal and state returns. (AE K) It is unclear whether this firm filed Applicant’s tax returns
for these 2009-2010 tax years. Applicant believes firm B filed her returns for these years
(Tr, 64-65), but could not provide any details. (Tr. 64-65) Based on firm B’s advice, she
did make a one-time payment of $5,000 to the IRS in 2013. (Tr. 70-71) 
Sometime in 2015, Applicant engaged another tax preparer (firm C) to file her
federal tax returns. (AE CC) Firm C confirmed in an undated letter that it prepared and
filed Applicant’s federal tax returns for tax years 2005-2016. No dates of retainer or tax
return filing were provided by firm C, and it is still unclear whether firm C filed Applicant’s
tax returns for tax years 2005-2014 before or after she completed her application for a
security clearance in May 2015. (GE 1) From the time-line presented by Applicant’s
retained tax firms for work they performed for Applicant between 2009 and 2013,
inferences are clearly warranted that she filed her federal returns for tax years 2005-2014
untimely, and likely after she completed her security application in May 2015.
Presumably, the IRS did not waive any late filing penalties or accrued interest for any of
the covered tax years.
From the correspondence furnished by the IRS tax advocate working with
Applicant and her tax preparer, Applicant completed an installment agreement with the
IRS in December 2015 covering tax years 2005-2014. (AEs G, I and CC) Terms of the
agreement called for monthly payments of $500 for February 2016 and monthly payments
of $3,090 thereafter, effective February 2017. (AEs and CC) In May 2017, Applicant 
completed a revised installment agreement. (AEs M and CC). Scheduled monthly
payments under this revised agreement were $1,311 beginning in June 2017, subject to
4
change in September 2017 to $2,414 a month, covering tax years 2005-2014. (AEs M
and CC) 
Applicant’s furnished IRS tax summary credits her with payments between 2006
and 2016 for the covered tax years as follows: 2005 ($380 received in February 2016);
2006 ($2,000 received in March-April 2016), 2007 ($500 received in May 2016); 2008
($500 received in February 2017); and 2009 ($1,086 received in June 2017, $225
received in June 2017, and $1,311 received in July 2017). Applicant’s IRS tax payments
made between February 2016 and July 2017 approximate $7,922. (AE CC) Additional
payments scheduled to be made under her 2015 installment agreement and revised 2017
installment agreement are not documented in her payment summary. With over $156,000
owing in delinquent federal taxes as of August 14, 2017, and no tax payments
documented since June 2017, it remains unclear whether Applicant is in compliance with
her installment agreements and how she will be able to negotiate another revised
installment agreement to reduce her monthly IRS payments for September 2017 and
beyond. With her current cash flow, she will likely need such a payment adjustment to
sustain her compliance with her negotiated 2017 installment agreement with the IRS.
(AEs I and CC)
Federal tax records confirm the existence of three federal tax liens filed against
Applicant: one in June 2014 covering taxes owed in the amount of $77,528; another in
November 2015 covering taxes owed in the amount of $62,937, and third in February
2016 covering taxes owed in the amount of $13,837. (GEs 2 and 5) These liens total
$156,096 as of August 2017, and remain outstanding without any clear resolution at this
time. (AE CC; Tr. 27-28)
Applicant’s historical track record of payments under her federal installment
agreements of 2016 and 2017 are relatively brief ones with no documented payments
meeting the scheduled minimum monthly payment requirements of her installment
agreements since July 2017. With so much owed and with a limited amount of confirmed
income to service her IRS installment, mortgage repayment plan, student loans once they
become active again, her non-SOR listed state tax installment agreement with monthly
obligations ($1,871 on a carried balance of $24,216), and her other delinquent accounts 
listed in the SOR, it is questionable whether Applicant will be able to cover these detailed
monthly obligations. 
Applicant’s personal financial statement that she completed in July 2017 reported
net monthly income of $7,296 on a gross annual salary of $116,000, monthly expenses of
$1,049, debt servicing of $5,898 (assuming a monthly IRS payment of $1,311), and a
projected net remainder of $347. (AE AA; Tr. 27-28) With the calculated jump in her
monthly IRS payment in September to $2,414, she promises to face a major shortfall in
her available income and corresponding expenses and debts to service. How Applicant is
prepared to address her anticipated income shortfall in the coming months is unclear.
Besides her accrued federal tax debts, Applicant incurred a major delinquency on
her mortgage. (GEs 2-4) Credit reports confirm that she became delinquent on her
5
$177,458 mortgage in the amount of $11,631( SOR debt ¶ 1.a) in 2016. (GEs 2-4) She
arranged for a repayment plan with the lender in June 2016 that calls for monthly
payments of $2,395. (AE B) Applicant is current in her payments, and the debt is no
longer in default. (AEs A-B; Tr. 28-29) 
Credit reports also confirm that Applicant became delinquent in her Government-
guaranteed student loans. (GEs 2-4) She documented her consolidating her four student
loans and obtaining forbearance from the lender on the listed loans totaling $22,000
(SOR debts ¶¶ 1.b-1.c and 1.g-1.h) in July 2017. (GE 4 and AEs C and EE; Tr. 29-32, 87-
90) Under its terms, the forbearance was scheduled to expire in September 2017. (AEs E
and CC) New monthly payment terms to commence in August 2017 are set at $350. (AE
CC; Tr. 31-32, 34-35, and 91-92) Applicant scheduled this payment in her personal
financial statement and assured she will be able to timely meet her monthly payments as
they come due. (AE AA) Her assurances are reasonable ones based on her prepared
budget plan. 
Other debts in reported delinquent status include a debt (SOR 1.j for $2,147)
related to her student loans, which is consolidated with her student loans. (Tr. 87-88)
Alleged delinquent debts covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.l ($2,934), 1,m ($261) and 1.n ($191) are
disputed by Applicant, who sent dispute notifications to the credit reporting agencies. (AE
Q; Tr. 37-39) 
Applicant is current with her other accounts. (Tr. 92-93) A state tax lien (not listed
in the SOR) covering accrued state taxes of $24,216 for tax years 2010-2014 has since
been addressed under an installment agreement Applicant arranged with the state’s tax
authority in 2014. (AEs D, E, N, and DD) Appellant’s documentation places her in
compliance with her installment agreement. (AE DD; Tr. 32-35)
Character references, awards, and performance evaluations
Applicant is well-regarded by her managers, supervisors and coworkers. (AE Y)
They credit her with being dedicated, reliable and trustworthy. Her efforts have earned her
promotions and awards recognizing her achievements and contributions. (AEs U and W)  
Her performance evaluations credit her with outstanding performance in all phases of her
work. (AE T) Her recognized contributions to her employer earned her a 2.54% pay raise
in 2017. (AE FF) 
Policies
                
       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the
decision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into
account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,
as well as considerations that could affect the individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and
ability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could
raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and
many of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.
6
These guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security
clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require
administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and
mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to
be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG ¶ 2(c).
In addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the
pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG
¶ 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial
commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines
within the context of the whole person. 
The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an
applicant’s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is
an acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG ¶ 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the
nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the
conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the
conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other
permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for
pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or
recurrence.
 Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual
guidelines are pertinent in this case:
Financial Considerations
       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy
debts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of
judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which
can raise questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness and
ability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can
also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,
other issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,
mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of
dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater
risk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to
generate funds. . . .  AG ¶ 18.
Burden of Proof
By virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or
continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding
that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive
7
requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence
accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a
security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that
evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  
As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences
which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the
judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.
The Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial
evidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that
the facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain
a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the
Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or
abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,
the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may
deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.
Once the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or
controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of
establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,
or mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances
be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of
demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. “[S]ecurity-clearance determinations
should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” See Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). 
Analysis  
Security concerns are raised over Applicant’s failure to timely file her federal tax
returns for tax years 2005-2013, accrual of federal tax liens covering delinquent taxes
exceeding $156,000, and delinquent debts concerning her mortgage and student loan
delinquencies and other smaller debts.
Financial Concerns
      Applicant’s failure to timely file federal tax returns for multiple years and her
incurring of delinquent federal and state taxes for the years in issue warrant the
application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC ¶¶ 19(a),
“inability to satisfy debts”; 19(c), “a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and
19(f), “failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax
returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.”
Financial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required
precisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that
entitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security
clearance holder’s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and
8
influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt
delinquencies.  
Historically, the timing of filing federal tax returns and resolving federal and state
tax delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant’s trustworthiness,
reliability, and good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those
seeking access to classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR
Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App.
Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant’s cited extenuating circumstances (i.e., medical issues
resulting in her loss of income between 2004 and 2014, loss of tax records associated
with her 2005 displacement following the floods associated with Hurricane Katrina), and
insufficient income to pay her accrued delinquent federal and state taxes when due and
payable) provide some mitigation credit for her failure to timely file her federal tax
returns and address her federal and state taxes due for the tax years 2005-2013. Based
on her cited circumstances, MC ¶ 20(b), “the conditions that resulted in the financial
problem were largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,” has some application to
Applicant’s situation, especially as to the flooding and displacement problems she
endured in 2005-2006.  
When Applicant, acting through her tax preparers,  filed her federal tax returns for
the covered SOR tax years of 2005-2013 is open to question. None of her tax preparers
provided any IRS tax transcripts for the tax years in issue (2005-2013) to document
their filing dates. Applicant’s documented installment agreement arranged with IRS
through its tax advocate in December 2015 makes no reference to tax return filing
dates, and IRS tax transcripts that would contain this information were not provided by
Applicant. Absent probative evidence of filing dates from Applicant, none can be
presumed. The most likely inference to draw from Applicant’s testimony and the exhibits
in evidence is that her returns were filed by her most recently retained tax preparer
sometime after Applicant completed her security clearance application in May 2015.
Based on Applicant’s  cited circumstances, the “acting responsibly” prong of  MC
¶ 20(b) has only limited application and cannot excuse her past failures to timely file her
tax returns for all of the covered tax years in the SOR, and timely address her owed
federal taxes for the tax years in issue (over $156,000 in delinquent taxes covered by
federal tax liens). Applicant’s failure or inability to corroborate her tax filing claims,
furnish persuasive evidence of her ability to stay current with her revised 2017
installment agreement with the IRS, and demonstrate a good track record of compliance
with the agreement’s terms precludes her from fully availing herself of the  benefits of
MC ¶ 20(b)  See ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017); ISCR Case
No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4
(App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005). For similar reasons, MC ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated and is
9
adhering to a  good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,” is
not available to mitigate her federal tax return filing lapses and incurring of federal tax
liens (still unresolved) over an extended number of years. 
Whether Applicant is entitled to the full mitigating benefits of MC ¶ 20(g), “the
individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or pay the
amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements,” is unclear at this point.
See ISCR Case No. 16-02246, at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 8, 2017). Applicant provided no
documentation at hearing or in permitted post-hearing submissions of her demonstrated
ability to sustain her compliance with her revised IRS installment agreement.  
To her credit, Applicant has made good progress with her other major creditors.
Her completion of repayment agreements with her mortgage and student loan lenders is
encouraging and reflects responsible, prudent efforts on her part to return these
accounts to current status. In recognition of these efforts, she is entitled to partial
application of MC ¶ 20(d), “the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort
to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.” She is entitled, to avail herself of
the mitigating benefits of MC  ¶ 20(e), “the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute
the legitimacy of the past-due debt[s] which is the cause of the problem and provides
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of
actions to resolve the issue,” as the MC pertains to her SOR debts covered by ¶¶ 1.l-
1.n.
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance
of a “meaningful track record” that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through
voluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely filing of tax
returns. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008)  In Applicant’s case,
her late filings of her 2005-2013 federal tax returns after the initiation of the security
clearance process and modest efforts in addressing her outstanding federal tax
payments due with the benefit of installment agreements with the IRS are not enough to
warrant favorable findings and conclusions with respect to raised security concerns. 
Whole-Person Assessment
Whole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. She has shown
insufficient  progress to date in addressing her late-filed federal tax returns for tax years
2005-2013 and delinquent federal taxes (over $156,000 in the aggregate) covered by
federal tax liens filed in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Her most recent installment agreement
with the IRS was inferentially arranged with the IRS tax advocate after the security
clearance process had already been iitiated in May 2015. While her repayment efforts
with her mortgage and student loan lenders merit positive credit, they are not enough to
overcome her tax filing lapses and insufficiently addressed tax delinquencies.  
10
Applicant’s general contributions to the U.S. defense effort through her Navy
service and her work in the defense industry are considerable and merit a good deal of
respect and appreciation. Her positive credits are insufficient, though to surmount
historical trust and judgment issues associated with her failure to timely file her federal
tax returns over the course of several years (i.e., 2005-2013) and failure or inability to
better address her major federal tax delinquencies with more timely and sustained
payments to demonstrate both compliance with the terms of her multiple installment
agreements with the IRS and a stronger historical payment history.
Overall, Applicant’s actions to date in addressing her finances reflect too little
evidence of restored financial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable
doubts about her trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information
or occupy a sensitive position. See AG ¶ 18. Conclusions are warranted that her
finances are insufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility requirements
for holding a security clearance.  Unfavorable conclusions are entered with respect to
the allegations covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.d-f and o. Favorable conclusions are entered for
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c and 1.g-1.n.  Eligibility to hold a security clearance under the facts and
circumstances of this case is inconsistent with the national interest.
Formal Findings
In reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the
context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I
make the following formal findings:
GUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT
   
             Subparagraphs 1.d-1.f and 1.o:                Against Applicant
  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.c and 1.g-1.n:          For Applicant
  
Conclusions
In light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant’s eligibility to
hold a security clearance. Clearance is denied.
