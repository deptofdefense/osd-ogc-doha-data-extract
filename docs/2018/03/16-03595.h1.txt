TUIDER, Robert, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant made sufficient progress resolving her delinquent debts. She mitigated 
financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. Eligibility for access to sensitive 
information is granted.      
  
Statement of the Case 
  
On August 24, 2015, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire 
for National Security Positions (SF-86). On January 10, 2017, the Department of Defense 
(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to 
Applicant, pursuant to DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, and modified; 
DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as 
amended (Regulation); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective on September 1, 2006. 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that it 
is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue her access 
to sensitive information, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether access to sensitive information should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. 
Specifically, the SOR set forth trustworthiness concerns arising under the financial 
considerations guideline.  
 
2                                       
 
On March 9, 2017, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and she requested 
a hearing. On June 26, 2017, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued 
a notice of hearing setting her hearing for August 16, 2017.  During the hearing, Department 
Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant offered 11 exhibits; there were no objections; and 
all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 11-14; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibits 
(AE) AE A-K) Applicant did not object, and I took administrative notice of the IRS filing 
instructions for tax years 2012, 2013, and 2014. (Tr. 12) On September 27, 2017, DOHA 
received a copy of the hearing transcript. After the hearing, Applicant provided three 
exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (AE L-AE N) The record closed on October 
16, 2017. (Tr. 67-69)    
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 Applicant’s SOR response partially or fully admitted all of the SOR allegations. She 
also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant admissions are accepted 
as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.  
 
Applicant is 41 years old, and she has been employed by a DOD contractor as a 
behavior analyst, trainer, and reviewer of approval of medical benefits from August 2015 
to the present. (Tr. 14-15) Her current annual salary is about $63,000. (Tr. 16) She has 
never served in the military. (Tr. 21) 
 
In 1994, Applicant graduated from high school, and in 1999, she received a bachelor 
of arts degree in psychology. (Tr. 17) In 2004, she received a master’s degree in 
psychology. (Tr. 18) In 1999, she married, and in August 2013, she separated from her 
spouse and filed for divorce. (Tr. 19, 27) She has custody of her 10-year-old son; however, 
her son’s father is not paying child support. (Tr. 19-20) Her husband is an emergency room 
technician, and he lives in a different state than Applicant. (Tr. 20-21) The divorce is not 
final. (Tr. 28) 
    
Financial Considerations 
 
Applicant had a difficult pregnancy and was unable to work from July to December 
2006. (Tr. 24) She was underemployed from 2006 to 2010. (Tr. 25) She was also 
unemployed in 2012. (Tr. 25) When she returned to the work force, she was unable to find 
employment that paid an adequate income. (Tr. 24) Applicant and her son had medical 
problems. (Tr. 25, 29, 61) In 2012, Applicant’s business collapsed, and she lost about 
$40,000. (GE 1) In October 2016, Applicant had a near-fatal medical problem that involved 
hospitalization. (AE H; AE K) In November 2016, she had additional serious medical 
problems. (AE K) Applicant’s spouse was physically abusive to her. (Tr. 27) She is willing 
to pay her debts. (Tr. 33) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant has a charged-off student loan for $15,715. This 
student loan was used to fund her husband’s training. (Tr. 31-34) Applicant also has a non-
SOR vehicle-related debt, and it relates to a vehicle her husband is using. (Tr. 31-34) She 
believes the divorce will eventually allocate these two debts to be his sole responsibility.

3                                       
 
(Tr. 31-34) On August 8, 2017, her husband sent an email indicating he is taking 
responsibility for these two debts. (Tr. 34-35) Her husband is currently in default on both 
debts. (Tr. 32-35)  
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g through 1.l allege that Applicant has debts placed for 
collection or delinquent for $1,353, $1,069, $389, $351, $253, $220, $174, and $150. She 
said she paid these debts using a credit card in early 2017; however, she did not offer any 
proof of payments at her hearing. (Tr. 39-40, 45-48) She said she could provide proof of 
payment after her hearing. (Tr. 39-40, 66) SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a medical debt placed for 
collection for $209. Applicant said she may have paid this debt. (Tr. 54) If she did not pay 
this debt, she planned to pay it. (Tr. 54) 
 
After her hearing, Applicant provided documentation showing she resolved the 
following six debts: SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,069) was settled on March 8, 2017, for $763; utility debt 
in SOR ¶ 1.g ($389) was paid on March 9, 2017; telecommunications debt in SOR ¶ 1.h 
($351) was paid on March 10, 2017; the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j ($220) and 1.k ($174) 
were paid on March 13, 2017; and the medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.l ($150) was paid on March 
9, 2017. (AE L at 2-5, 7-8)   
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f allege that Applicant has one medical debt placed for 
collection for $969, and two delinquent medical debts for $674 and $538. (Tr. 42-45) She 
said in 2017 she wrote the creditors and asked for verification of the debts; however, she 
did not provide a copy of her letters seeking verification. (Tr. 42-45) She said she could 
provide copies of the letters after the hearing. (Tr. 44) She did not provide copies of the 
dispute letters after her hearing. 
 
Applicant said she provided proof of payment for $3,959 of debt owed for SOR ¶¶ 
1.b to 1.l with $2,390 remaining (not counting her husband’s car loan). She did not provide 
a detailed list of which debts were addressed with the $3,959. She said she is still working 
to clarify the three medical bills. (AE L) She provided a checking account statement, and I 
added markings where the payment was consistent with the amounts on the SOR. (AE L 
at 2).  In addition to resolving the debts previously discussed, she is credited with paying 
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($1,353) and 1.i ($253) because she corroborated payment with 
her account statement. (AE L at 2)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges a federal tax lien was entered against Applicant in 2010 for 
$19,229. In late 2011, Applicant’s business closed. (Tr. 51) Her income was low until her 
current employment. (Tr. 53) She was unable to file her tax returns as married joint returns 
without her spouse’s income information. Her husband recently gave Applicant five years 
of W-2s, and he wanted her to file their tax returns. (Tr. 52) Before establishing a payment 
plan, she needed to file her and her husband’s overdue tax returns. She most recently 
received correspondence from the IRS in 2009. (Tr. 53)  
 
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges Applicant failed to file her state tax return for tax year 2012. As 
of the date of the hearing, she had not filed this tax return. (Tr. 54) After her hearing, 
Applicant provided her 2012 state tax return, which was dated October 16, 2017, and it 
showed a refund for $295. (AE M) The state tax return was a joint return, and the adjusted 
gross income was $21,699. (AE M) 
 
4                                       
 
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges she failed to file her federal income tax returns for tax years 2012 
through 2014. In 2013, she moved to a state that did not have state income tax. She gave 
three reasons for not filing her federal income tax returns for 2012, 2013, and 2014: her 
income fell below the threshold for filing income taxes (GE 1); she did not have all of the 
necessary W-2s (Tr. 54); and she was worried that she would owe more taxes. (Tr. 54) Her 
husband was not cooperative in filing married joint tax returns. (Tr. 55) Two weeks before 
her hearing, she started working with her brother, who is an accountant to prepare her 
income tax returns. (Tr. 56) She said she did not need to file tax returns in 2013 and 2014 
because her income was $4,500. (Tr. 59) She said she needed to file her federal income 
tax return for 2013 and possibly 2012. (Tr. 60) She filed married filing separately for tax 
years 2015 and 2016. (Tr. 60; AE D) The copy of her 2015 federal tax return she provided 
is not dated or signed. (AE D) She provided a partial summary of 2016 federal income tax 
return, and not a copy of her tax return. (AE E)  
 
Applicant’s spouse’s W2s indicated income as follows: 2012 ($20,338); 2013 
($22,373); 2014 ($21,552); 2015 ($21,080); and 2016 ($25,478). (Tr. 62; AE F) On October 
15, 2013, the family court ordered her spouse to pay Applicant $200 monthly for child 
support, and each party is responsible for his and her own indebtedness. (AE G)    
 
Information from Applicant’s tax returns is depicted in the following table: 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Applicant said that after filing her federal income tax returns for tax years 2012, 
2013, and 2014, she was entitled to a tax refund of $15,263. (AE N) She believes this 
refund will significantly reduce her tax lien. (AE N) Applicant provided unsigned, undated 
joint federal tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014. (AE N) 
 
 The income threshold for married filing separately from 2012 to 2015 is as follows: 
2012 ($3,800); 2013 ($3,900); 2014 ($3,950); and 2015 ($4,000). (IRS Publication 501, 
Exemptions, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information for 2012 to 2015)  Subtraction of 
Applicant’s spouse’s wage information on his W2s for 2012, 2013, and 2014 from the 
adjusted gross income for those three years indicates Applicant’s income fell below the 
filing thresholds for those three tax years. Applicant was not legally required to file tax 
returns for those three years in her status as married filing separately. Applicant believed 
that her tax refunds would substantially resolve her tax lien, which was her only option for 
filing a tax return without the cooperation of her spouse.  
 
                                            
2 The summary she provided indicated taxable income ($37,199), total tax ($3,790), and amount 
refunded ($1,169) and not adjusted gross income and tax credits. (AE E)

 According to the IRS, “If you are due a refund for withholding or estimated taxes, 
you must file your return to claim it within 3 years of the return due date. The same rule 
applies to a right to claim tax credits such as the Earned Income Credit.”3 Since the tax 
returns for 2012, 2013, and 2014 were filed in October 2017, and most of the refund is due 
to the Earned Income Credit, the IRS may not give her the refunds she anticipated for tax 
years 2012 and 2013. 
 
 Applicant received two awards from her employer in December 2015. (AE I) Her 
employee evaluation for 2016 was three for “solid performance” on a score of one to five 
with five being the best. (AE J) She has improved during the rating period; she is helpful to 
others; and she is a valued member of the team. (AE J)  
 
Policies 
 
This case is adjudicated under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel 
Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, 2017. 
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of 
human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the 
adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, 
impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a 
conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the “whole-person concept.” The 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past 
and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or 
mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The applicant has 
the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  
 
A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government 
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to 
sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk 
the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.

Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 AG ¶ 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness 
to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an 
individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or 
sensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated 
by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security 
concern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance 
misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  
 
 AG ¶ 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness 
concern and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability to satisfy debts”; “(c) a history 
of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local 
income tax as required.” In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the 
Appeal Board explained: 
 
It is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally 
meet the substantial evidence standard and the government’s obligations 
under [Directive] ¶ E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden 
shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the 
debt or that matters in mitigation apply. 
 
(internal citation omitted). The evidence of record establishes AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). 
Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. 
 
 AG ¶ 20 provides financial considerations mitigating conditions that are potentially 
applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,4 was so infrequent, or occurred under 
such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the 
individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
                                            
4 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
7                                       
 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-
due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof 
to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to 
resolve the issue; 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: 
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s eligibility [for a public trust 
position], there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a [public trust position]. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents 
evidence raising [trustworthiness] concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant 
to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The standard 
applicable in [public trust position] decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. 
“Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] 
information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” Directive, 
Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b). 
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). 
 
Two recent Appeal Board decisions illustrate the analysis for applying AG ¶¶ 20(a) 
and 20(b). In ISCR Case No. 09-08533, the applicant had $41,000 in delinquent credit card 
debt and defaulted on a home loan generating a $162,000 delinquent debt. Id. at 2. That 
applicant filed for bankruptcy the same month the Administrative Judge issued her 
decision. Id. at 1-2. The applicant in ISCR Case No. 09-08533 was recently divorced, had 
been unemployed for 10 months, and had childcare responsibilities. Her former husband 
was inconsistent in his child support payments to her. The Appeal Board determined that 
AG ¶ 20(a) was “clearly applicable (debt occurred under such circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and [the debt] does not cast doubt on the individual’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment)” even though that applicant’s debts were unresolved at 
the time the Administrative Judge’s decision was issued. The Appeal Board also decided 
 
8                                       
 
that the record evidence raised the applicability of AG ¶ 20(b) because of the absence of 
evidence5 of irresponsible behavior, poor judgment, unreliability, or lack of trustworthiness. 
Id. at 4.   
  
Similarly, in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) the Appeal 
Board addressed a situation where an applicant was sporadically unemployed and lacked 
the ability to pay her creditors. The Appeal Board noted “it will be a long time at best before 
she has paid” all of her creditors. The applicant was living on unemployment compensation 
at the time of her hearing. The Appeal Board explained that such a circumstance was not 
necessarily a bar to having access to classified information stating: 
 
However, the Board has previously noted that an applicant is not required to 
be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or 
simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given 
his [or her] circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, 
accompanied by “concomitant conduct,” that is, actions which evidence a 
serious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. 
Bd. May 21, 2008). 
 
ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). The applicant in ISCR Case No. 
08-06567 used his limited resources to (1) resolve some of his debts; (2) had a repayment 
plan for the remaining debts; and (3) took “reasonable actions to effectuate that plan.” Id. 
The Appeal Board remanded the Administrative Judge’s decision because it did not 
“articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions,” emphasizing the Administrative 
Judge did “not explain[] what he believes that applicant could or should have done under 
the circumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial condition, or 
why the approach taken by applicant was not ‘responsible’ in light of his limited 
circumstances.” Id.   
 
 Application of AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) is warranted. Applicant’s finances were 
adversely affected by failure of her business, medical problems, unemployment, 
underemployment, her separation from her husband, and his failure to pay court-ordered 
child support. She acted responsibly by paying as many debts as possible. She has a plan 
for resolving all of her debt, and she promised to do so when she has sufficient funds. 
Although there is limited evidence of record that she established and maintained contact 
with her creditors,6 her financial problem is being resolved and is under control.      
 
                                            
5 Applicant has the burden of proving the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and the burden to 
disprove a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. 
 
6  “Even if Applicant’s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances 
outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable 
manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.” ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 
2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. 
Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she 
maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. 
 
 
9                                       
 
 Applicant admitted responsibility for and took reasonable and responsible actions to 
resolve her debts, establishing some good faith.7 Based on Applicant’s credible and sincere 
promise to pay her debts and her track record of paying her debts, future new delinquent 
debt “is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on [Applicant’s] current reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment,” and “there are clear indications that the problem is 
being resolved or is under control.” She has sufficient income to keep her debts in current 
status and to continue making progress paying her remaining debts. I am confident that 
Applicant will conscientiously endeavor to maintain her financial responsibility. Her efforts 
are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances 
surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the 
frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual’s age and maturity 
at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; 
(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral 
changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, 
coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or 
recurrence.  
     
Under AG ¶ 2(c), “[t]he ultimate determination” of whether to grant a public trust 
position “must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration” of 
the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were addressed 
under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
Applicant is 41 years old, and she has been employed by a DOD contractor as a 
behavior analyst, trainer, and reviewer for approval of medical benefits from August 2015 
to the present. Her current annual salary is about $63,000. In 1994, Applicant graduated 
                                            
7 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other 
good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not define the 
term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith ‘requires 
a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and 
adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show 
that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the 
benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

from high school, and in 1999, she received a bachelor of arts degree in psychology. In 
2004, she received a master’s degree in psychology. In 1999, she married, and in August 
2013, she separated from her spouse and filed for divorce. She has custody of her 10-
year-old son; however, her son’s father is not paying the $200 monthly court-ordered child 
support. Their divorce is not final.     
 
Several circumstances beyond Applicant’s control adversely affected her finances: 
unemployment; underemployment; medical problems; separation from her spouse; and the 
loss of her business. Applicant said she paid all of the SOR debts, except for the debts in 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a (her husband’s student loan debt for $15,715) and 1.m (federal tax lien for 
$19,229). Her husband agreed to take responsibility for his student loan debt. If she is co-
signed on the student loan, she remains secondarily responsible for it, notwithstanding the 
allocation of the family court. It is unclear whether Applicant is jointly responsible for her 
husband’s student loan debt, and the amount of the tax lien that will be remain after 
applying the tax refunds for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2015. She will need to establish a 
payment plan with the IRS in the near future. She provided proof that she resolved the 
eight debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g through 1.l. 
 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating: 
 
. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of 
actual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every 
debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate 
that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken 
significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge can reasonably 
consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial situation and his actions in 
evaluating the extent to which that applicant’s plan for the reduction of his 
outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) 
(Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable 
and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.) There 
is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts 
simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may 
provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no 
requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable 
debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  
 
ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation 
marks omitted). She understands what she needs to do to establish and maintain her 
financial responsibility. She took reasonable actions under her particular financial 
circumstances to address her delinquent debts. Applicant has established a “meaningful 
track record” of debt re-payment, and I am confident she will maintain her financial 
responsibility. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
DOD Manual 5200.02, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the 
whole person. I conclude that financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are

mitigated. It is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant 
eligibility for public trust position. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     FOR APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.p:   For Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the 
interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position. Eligibility 
for access to sensitive information is granted.
