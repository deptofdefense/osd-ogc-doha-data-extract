HEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial 
Considerations) and E (Personal Conduct). Applicant has unresolved financial problems, 
including unpaid taxes and delinquent debts. She falsified her security clearance 
application regarding her unfiled and unpaid federal taxes. Eligibility for access to 
classified information is denied. 
 
History of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application on October 30, 2014. On 
August 10, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons 
(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DOD acted under 
Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry 
(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent 
Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all 
decisions on or after June 8, 2017.

 Applicant answered the SOR on September 6, 2017, and requested a decision on 
the record without a hearing. On October 13, 2017, complete copy of the File of Relevant 
Material (FORM), containing four Items, was mailed to Applicant and received by her on 
October 25, 2017. The FORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file 
objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of 
her receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not object to the Government’s Items. Hence, 
Items 1 through 4 are admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant submitted a 
response and evidence in response to the FORM, which were collectively admitted 
without objection as Applicant’s Exhibit (AX) A. The case was assigned to me on February 
12, 2018.  
 
Findings of Fact1 
 
 The SOR alleges failure to file and pay federal taxes, seven medical debts (SOR 
¶¶ 1.a. through 1.i.), and one falsification on a security clearance questionnaire (SOR ¶ 
2.a.). In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she denied all of the allegations with explanation. 
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following 
findings of fact: 
 
Applicant is 39 years old and since September 2016, has been employed by a 
defense contractor. She requires a security clearance for this employment. She has 
worked as a federal contractor since 2003, and was previously granted DOD clearances 
in May 2003 and May 2008. Applicant and her ex-husband divorced in 2000, after less 
than one year of marriage, and she has two children, ages 18 and 22. Applicant earned 
an associate’s degree in 2002, and a bachelor’s degree in 2010. 
 
Guideline F 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a. alleges failure to pay delinquent federal taxes in the amount of 
$39,503.66 for tax years 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011. SOR ¶ 1.b. alleges failure to file 
federal tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016. SOR ¶¶ 1.c. through 1.i. are delinquent 
medical bills, totaling $1,597.   
 
 In her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided documentation demonstrating tax 
years 20072 and 20093 were resolved in April 2016 (Item 2 at 16-18 and 20-22). She also 
                                                          
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from her security application (Item 3) unless otherwise 
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. 
 
2  Applicant filed her tax return for tax year 2007, in January 2011. In February 2011, Applicant made a 
$2,000 payment toward tax year 2007. Six months later she set up an installment agreement and made six 
payments, totaling $1,600. In October 2012, her installment agreement was cancelled. The IRS sent her a 
Notice of Intent to Levy in December 2012, and in August 2013, the IRS issued a notice of lien filing, and a 
lien was placed on her assets.  On March 4, 2016, she made one more active payment toward tax year 
2007, in the amount of $436. The IRS transferred credits from tax years 2012 and 2015, in the amount of 
$11,653.66, which resolved the tax debt in April 2016.   
  
3  Applicant filed her tax return for tax year 2009, in September 2010, before the October 15, 2010 deadline. 
Between October 2010 and January 2013, Applicant made three payments totaling $425.48 toward tax 
 3
provided documentation from the IRS indicating she owed $27,317.18 for tax years 20104 
and 2011.5 Applicant claimed she was on a payment plan for this debt (Item 2 at 20). 
Finally, she provided documentation demonstrating she filed her 2015 and 2016 federal 
tax returns in August 2017 (Item 2 at 31 and 32).6 Her tax issues were the result of being 
employed part-time and full-time as a 1099 contractor and inconsistent income. 
Additionally, the IRS charged her twice for a 401k withdrawal in 2010 (Item 2 at 2).   
 
 In her response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation demonstrating 
she is in a payment arrangement with the IRS. The October 18, 2017, letter from the IRS 
shows an outstanding balance of $26,552.84. Her monthly payment amount is $607, 
which was due on October 28, 2017. This letter reflects a last monthly payment of $0. It 
is not clear which tax years are included in this payment arrangement (AX A). 
 
In her Answer, Applicant denied all of the seven medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.c. to 1.i., because they should have been submitted to her medical insurance company. 
Despite her denials, Applicant presented documentation that on August 30, 2017, she 
entered into a payment arrangement with Company A for SOR ¶ 1.d. in which she 
authorized a monthly automatic withdrawal of $50 per month for seven months, totaling 
$350 (Item 2 at 8). She also claimed to be in payment arrangements for SOR ¶¶ 1.c. and 
1.e. through 1.g.7 Applicant denied SOR ¶ 1.h.on the grounds that she could not locate 
                                                          
year 2009. She was issued a Notice of Intent to Levy in May 2011, established an installment agreement 
in August 2011, made no payments, and was removed from the installment agreement in October 2012. 
The IRS issued her notice of lien filing in August 2013, July 2014, and July 2015. The IRS transferred 
credits from tax years 2008, 2012, 2013, and 2014, in the amount of $13,243.29, which resolved the tax 
debt in April 2016. 
 
4 Applicant filed her 2010 tax return on November 21, 2011, over a month after her due date of October 15, 
2011. A notice was issued on November 21, 2011, and she entered into an installment agreement on 
December 10, 2011. She made no payments and was removed from the installment agreement on October 
8, 2012. In January 2013, the IRS issued a Notice of Intent to Levy, and in August 2013, a lien was placed 
against her assets. A notice was issued again in July 2014 and July 2015. The IRS transferred credit from 
tax years 2015 and 2016, totaling $4,185.05, but as of August 24, 2017, this year had an outstanding 
balance of $15,316.91. The IRS documentation does not reflect any active payments made by Applicant 
(Item 2 at 23-24). 
 
5 Applicant filed her 2011 tax return on May 28, 2012, over a month after her due date of April 15, 2012. A 
notice was issued on May 28, 2012, and she entered into an installment agreement on June 16, 2012. She 
made one $400 payment, but was removed from the installment agreement on October 8, 2012. In 
December 2012, the IRS issued a Notice of Intent to Levy, and in August 2013, a lien was placed against 
her assets. A notice was issued again in July 2014 and July 2015. As of August 24, 2017, this year had an 
outstanding balance of $14,409.54. The IRS documentation does not reflect any active payments made by 
Applicant (Item 2 at 26-27). 
 
6  Applicant filed her federal tax returns late for tax years 2005, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 
and 2016. Each of these returns were filed after either the April 15th deadline or if she had obtained an 
extension (2010, 2012, 2014 and 2015) after the October 15th extension deadline.  
 
7  In her September 6, 2017, Answer to the SOR, Applicant claims she has made the following payment 
arrangements: SOR ¶ 1.c. $25 per month; SOR ¶ 1.d. $50 per month, this was the only debt included in 
the payment plan she entered into in August 2017; SOR ¶ 1.e.  $60 per month; SOR ¶ 1.f. $20 per month; 
and, SOR ¶ 1.g. $20 per month.

this debt and it was no longer appearing on her credit report. Finally, she claimed she 
paid SOR ¶ 1.i. In her response to the FORM, Applicant again asserted she is in payment 
plans for SOR ¶¶ 1.c. through 1.g.,8 and she has resolved SOR ¶ 1.h. through dispute 
and SOR ¶ 1.i. through payment (AX A at 1).  
 
Guideline E 
 
On October 30, 2014, Applicant signed a security clearance application (SCA) 
certifying that the statements made therein were “true, complete, and correct to the best 
of [her] knowledge and belief and [were] made in good faith,” (Item 3). In section 26 
(Financial Record),9 Applicant disclosed she owed the IRS $7,000 for tax year 2007. She 
claimed she had a payment arrangement with the IRS in the past, but payments were 
applied to a different tax year. As a result of this issue, she hired a CPA and this person 
filed her taxes through tax year 2013. At that time, Applicant was waiting for another 
payment agreement and expected her taxes would be resolved in the near future (Item 3 
at 44-45). She did not disclose issues related to any other tax years.  
 
In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied concealing material facts regarding 
her owed back taxes for tax years 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011, and failure to file federal 
income tax returns for tax years 2012, and 2013. She asserted that she was unaware of 
these issues because she had always used a CPA service to complete and file her taxes. 
She claimed she provided the information to her CPA to file for 2012 and 2013, and was 
unaware he or she had not filed these years (Item 2 at 4). 
 
In her response to the FORM, Applicant reiterated that she did not intentionally 
conceal her tax issues from the government. She stated she did not receive the various 
letters and notices sent by the IRS to her because she was working in City A and had a 
Post Office Box in City B (AX A at 2). 
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”10 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”11 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
                                                          
8  In her November 16, 2017 Response to the FORM Applicant claims the same payment arrangements as 
outlined under FN 7, except she is paying: SOR ¶ 1.f. $35 per month and SOR ¶ 1.g. is included in the $35 
payment for SOR ¶ 1.f. (AX A). 
.

2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”12 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”13 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.14 “Substantial evidence” is “more than 
a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”15 The guidelines presume a nexus or rational 
connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an 
applicant’s security suitability.16 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.17 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.18

Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
 The concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  
 
 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.21  
 
 Applicant’s admissions and her credit report establish three disqualifying 
conditions under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (“inability to satisfy debts”), AG ¶ 19(c) (“a 
history of not meeting financial obligations”), and AG ¶ 19(f) (“failure to file or fraudulently 
filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, 
state, or local income tax as required”). 
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following 
potentially applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment;

21 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 7
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; 
 
AG ¶ 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy 
of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  
  
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax 
authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
AG ¶ 20(a) is not established. Applicant consistently filed her federal tax returns 
late, including after the SOR was issued (Items 2 and 4). The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 
1.c. through 1.e. were assigned for collection between 2013 and 2015. Thus, her financial 
problems are recent and recurrent.  
AG ¶ 20(b) is not fully established. Despite her history of inconsistent income, 
Applicant did not meet her burden to establish that she acted responsibly to address her 
unfiled federal tax returns and unpaid debts in a timely manner.  
 
AG ¶ 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant failed to provide documentation 
showing that she has been making timely and consistent payments toward her various 
payment plans for the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a., and 1.c. through 1.i.  
 
AG ¶ 20(e) is not established. While Applicant articulated a basis to dispute SOR 
¶¶ 1.h. and 1.i, she did not provide documentary proof to substantiate her dispute or 
sufficient evidence of actions taken to resolve the debts. 
 
 AG ¶ 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant has set up a payment plan for at least 
some of her federal tax debt, but she has not provided documentary proof of timely and 
consistent payments. The documentation she submitted from the IRS, shows a history of 
establishing payment arrangements, but failure to make consistent payments. I credit 
Applicant with filing her 2015 and 2016 federal tax returns. However, she filed these 
returns only after the Government sent her the SOR. 
 
I considered that Applicant is not required to be debt-free in order to qualify for a 
security clearance.22 However, she has not provided proof of payments on her current 
                                                          
22 ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (An applicant does not have to be debt-free in 
order to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given 
 8
federal tax debt. Nor has she submitted proof of payment or resolution for her seven 
delinquent medical debts. Applicant failed to file her federal tax returns for tax years 2015 
and 2016, until August 2017, and she consistently filed previous tax returns after she was 
legally required to file. Moreover, she failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish that 
she acted responsibly to address her debt. Thus, I cannot conclude that Applicant has 
mitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time.  
 
Guideline E (Personal Conduct) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 15: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in 
an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance 
action, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: 
 
(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or 
cooperate with security processing, including but not limited 
to meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, 
completing security forms or releases, cooperation with 
medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph 
examination, if authorized and required; and 
 
(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful 
questions of investigators, security officials, or other official 
representatives in connection with a personnel security or 
trustworthiness determination. 
 
When a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of 
proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative 
judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant’s state of 
mind at the time of the omission.23 An applicant’s level of education and business 
experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information 
on a security clearance application was deliberate.24  
 
                                                          
his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by “concomitant conduct” 
that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan). 
 
23 See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). 
 
24 ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). 
 
 9
Applicant intentionally falsified materially relevant facts on her October 2014 
Security Clearance Application, which establishes the following disqualifying condition 
under this guideline: 
 
AG ¶ 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, 
or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment 
qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility 
or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  
 
The security concerns raised under this guideline have not been mitigated 
by either of the following factors: 
 
AG ¶ 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the 
omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the 
facts; and  
 
AG ¶ 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the 
behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances 
that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's 
reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. 
 
Applicant’s failure to report her entire federal tax debt and her failure to file for 
multiple tax years is security significant, especially in light of her familiarity with the 
clearance process. She has maintained a security clearance for a long period of time. Her 
explanations and excuses for failing to report these materially relevant facts on her SCA 
are not credible.  
 
The IRS documentation submitted by Applicant demonstrates she was sent 
notices regarding her delinquent taxes prior to completing her August 2014 SCA.   Given 
these facts, there is substantial evidence of an intent on the part of the Applicant to omit, 
conceal, and falsify security-significant facts from and on SCA. Serious doubts are raised 
about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment based not only upon her 
falsification of SCA but also her history of failing to file federal income tax returns in a 
timely manner and pay financial obligations. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG 
¶ 2(d): 
 
 10
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying 
and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in 
the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security 
concerns raised by her failure to pay her delinquent debts and disclose these debts to the 
government. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly 
consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant her eligibility for 
access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraph 1.a.:   Against Applicant    
Subparagraph 1.b.:   For Applicant 
Subparagraph 1.c. – 1.i.:  Against Applicant 
 
 Paragraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct:  AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraph 2.a.:   Against Applicant 
 
Conclusion 
 
 I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the 
United States to continue Applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
Clearance is denied.
