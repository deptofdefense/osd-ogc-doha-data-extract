naturalized U.S. citizen. They have two children, who are natural born U.S. citizens. (Tr. 
20-28.)  
 
Under the guideline for Foreign Preference, the SOR alleged Applicant used her 
Nigerian passport to travel to Nigeria in March 2014. Applicant admitted this, but noted 
she used her Nigerian passport prior to accepting employment with a government 
contractor. She has formally renounced her Nigerian citizenship. (AE D.) 
 
Under the Guideline for Foreign Influence, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s 
father, father-in-law, and cousins are citizens and residents of Nigeria. Her father is now 
a permanent legal resident of the United States and has no plans to return to Nigeria. 
He lives with Applicant’s mother. (Tr. 38-44.) Applicant has only met her father-in-law 
once. (Tr. 47.) He is a citizen and resident of Nigeria. Applicant’s husband speaks to his 
father “very rarely,” as his father had three or four wives and they are not close. (Tr. 45-
50.) Applicant only communicated with one cousin in Nigeria since immigrating to the 
United States. That cousin was alleged to be employed by the Government of Nigeria, 
and works for the Ministry of Engineering. Applicant’s contact with this cousin is 
infrequent and casual. (Tr. 50-55.) 
  
Mitigating conditions set out in AG ¶¶ 8 (b), 8(c), and 11(c) have been 
established by the evidence. There is no doubt about Applicant’s current reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching 
this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole and considered whether the 
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence. I also gave due consideration 
to the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate 
burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant her national security eligibility for access to classified information. National 
security eligibility is granted.
