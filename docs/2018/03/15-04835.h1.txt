GARCIA, Candace Le’i, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. 
Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On February 23, 2016, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial 
considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG).1 
 
Applicant responded to the SOR on April 1, 2016, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to an administrative judge on 
                                                     
1 I decided this case using the AG implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. However, I also considered this 
case under the previous AG implemented on September 1, 2006, and my conclusions are the same using 
either set of AG. 
 
2 
 
August 12, 2016 and reassigned to another administrative judge on September 11, 
2017.  
 
On October 25, 2017, the Government amended the SOR, pursuant to ¶ E3.1.13 
of the Directive. It withdrew the allegations in ¶¶ 1.g to 1.n, 1.q, and 1.r; it amended the 
creditor and amount in allegation ¶ 1.o; and it added allegations ¶¶ 1.u through 1.bb.2  
 
The case was reassigned to me on November 9, 2017. The Defense Office of 
Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on November 28, 2017, 
scheduling the hearing for December 7, 2017. Applicant waived the 15-day notice 
requirement. I convened the hearing as scheduled.3 
  
I appended to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II the Government’s 
discovery letter and exhibit list. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted in 
evidence without objection. Applicant testified.                                                                                        
  
At Applicant’s request and with no objection from the Government, I left the 
record open until December 21, 2017, for Applicant to submit additional documentation. 
Applicant timely provided additional evidence, which I marked collectively as AE A and 
admitted into evidence without objection. I appended to the record as HE III the 
Government’s amendment to the SOR. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on 
December 18, 2017.  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.p, 1.s, and 1.u to 1.bb. He denied 
¶¶ 1.a to 1.f, 1.o, and 1.t. He is 45 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007 
and he was pursuing a master’s degree as of the hearing. He has never been married 
and he did not have any children. He resided with his parents as of his 2012 security 
clearance application.4 
 
 At the time of the hearing, Applicant worked as a junior cyber analyst for a 
defense contractor since July 2017. He served honorably in the U.S. military from 1994 
to 1999, during which time he was first granted a DOD security clearance. He worked 
for the federal government from 2003 to 2005. Since October 2005, he has worked for 
various defense contractors. He has not had any security infractions or violations.5  
   
 The SOR alleges 7 delinquent consumer accounts totaling $31,543 (SOR ¶¶ 1.o 
– 1.p, 1.s – 1.v, 1.bb) and 11 delinquent medical debts totaling $3,313 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 
1.f, 1.w – 1.aa). The debts are established by Applicant’s admissions and credit reports

to end in late December 2017.

from July 2012, April 2015, January 2016, and October 2017. Applicant also disclosed 
some of his debts on his 2012 security clearance application.6  
 
 Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to the changing nature of defense 
contracting and the periods in which he was either unemployed, without unemployment 
benefits, or worked full-time for a temporary agency during the interim of his contracts. 
He also cited to a serious illness from 2011 to 2012 as a contributing factor. He 
acknowledged that his decision to leave the federal government to work for defense 
contractors was a voluntary one. He also acknowledged that the only position with a 
defense contractor that he did not voluntarily leave occurred in November 2010.7  
 
 Applicant first worked for a defense contractor from October 2005 to November 
2006. He next worked for a defense contractor from January 2007 to November 2008, 
the latter period in which he was scaled to a part-time status because the contract was 
in danger of losing funding. He voluntarily left and worked for a temporary agency for six 
months until May 2009. He then worked for another defense contractor until October 
2009, but voluntarily left because it was not a good fit. He was unemployed for ten 
months from October 2009 to August 2010. From August 2010 to November 2010, he 
worked for another defense contractor, but left after he became ill. He then worked for 
another defense contractor for only 10 days after his illness worsened. He 
acknowledged that he was terminated because his employer was unable to track his 
physical whereabouts during business hours, but stated that he was falsely accused of 
abandoning the job. During the period in question, he stated that he was on sick leave 
and reported such to his supervisor.8  
 
 Applicant was severely ill for 16 to 18 months in early 2011 to mid-2012, during 
which time he had lengthy stays and multiple visits to the hospital. During this period, he 
was covered solely by insurance through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); 
since 2012, he obtained supplemental insurance. He also worked for a temporary 
agency and did not have consistent employment, in that he worked full-time only 20% of 
the time, at a reduced income of $15 to $20 an hour.9   
 
 From July 2012 to May 2013, he worked for another defense contractor. Less 
than one month into his employment, his income was reduced from $79,000 to $60,000, 
after he was given the option to take a lower position at the reduced income because 
the position for which he was initially hired was no longer available. He then left the job 
voluntarily because the position was not a good fit. Several months later, he worked for 
a temporary agency for two months until September 2013. He then worked for another 
defense contractor until April 2014, at an annual salary of $75,000. He voluntarily left

after he was told that he would likely be laid off unless he took a position in a different 
state. He then worked for a temporary agency for four months until September 2014.10  
 
 For nine months, from late 2014 until the summer of 2015, he worked for the 
same defense contractor for whom he worked in 2012. His annual salary was $91,000. 
He voluntarily left to pursue new opportunities. He was unemployed for one month 
before he became reemployed in September 2015, with the same defense contractor 
for whom he worked in 2014. His starting annual salary was $94,000. It was $96,000 
when he left in July 2016. He left primarily because he had received the SOR and was 
told that doing so would stop the adjudication of his security clearance. He also cited to 
some changes in upper management as contributing factors. He was unemployed for 
one month until August 2016. He then worked for a temporary agency for six months 
until mid-February 2017. He was unemployed until July 2017. He began working for his 
current defense contractor in July 2017, at an annual salary of $30,000.11   
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.f are medical debts associated with Applicant’s 2011 hospital 
visits. Though he tried to go to the VA hospital for most of his medical care, he 
acknowledged there were times when he went to a different hospital that was in closer 
proximity to him. When he did so, he knew that he would be responsible for the out-of-
pocket costs. In his response to the SOR, he stated that he was in the process of trying 
to determine the origin of these debts. At hearing, he testified that he contacted his 
medical creditors in 2016 and confirmed that they were valid debts, but some were 
more than seven years old. He paid a total of $250 towards multiple medical debts for a 
hospital he frequented in 2011, but he could not say which ones. He did not provide 
documentation to corroborate his claims.12  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.o, 1.s, and 1.bb are for the deficiency balances of three different cars 
that were involuntarily repossessed in September 2014, the fall of 2013, and April 2017, 
respectively. Applicant was in contact with the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.bb prior to the 
repossession, in an attempt to bring his account current, but he was unsuccessful. 
Applicant contacted the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.o in 2016 and almost settled the debt, but 
took a step back after he had suspicions as to whether he was communicating with the 
proper third party. He contacted the creditors for SOR ¶¶ 1.s and 1.bb. He had not 
made any payments towards any of these debts.13  
  
 SOR ¶ 1.p is for a credit card that became delinquent in 2010. Applicant testified 
that he made some payments towards it and was in contact with the creditor in 2012, 
but decided to place it at a low priority since it was an old debt that would potentially fall

off his credit report. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim of 
payment.14  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.t was for a student loan Applicant obtained in 2009. He initially disputed 
the amount but then decided to pay it. He provided documentation to show that he 
resolved it in July 2015. It was no longer reported on his 2016 and 2017 credit reports.15 
 
 SOR ¶ 1.u is for a delinquent cable bill that was unresolved.16  
 
 SOR ¶ 1.v is for delinquent car insurance. Applicant spoke to the creditor four 
months prior to the hearing. He intended to resolve this debt so that he could obtain 
insurance and another car.17  
 
 SOR ¶¶ 1.w to 1.aa are for out-of-pocket medical costs associated with two 
surgeries from 2015 to repair a scar. The costs were not covered by Applicant’s VA or 
supplemental insurance. He was unhappy with the level of care he received. He has not 
resolved or disputed these debts.18  
 
 Applicant believed he had other delinquent debts, some for which he made good- 
faith payments, but he could not recall the specifics. He was careful whom he paid 
because he wanted to avoid identity theft. He has not received financial counseling 
because he did not believe his obligations were insurmountable. He prioritized his debts 
so that he could first pay his day-to-day expenses, then address his more recent debts, 
and finally address his older debts. He intended to resolve his debts as soon as he had 
stable employment. 19  
 
Policies 
 
 When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially 
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an 
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the 
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in 
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s

overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According 
to AG ¶ 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a decision. 
 
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b) 
requires that “[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security 
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”  
 
Under Directive ¶ E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish 
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant is 
responsible for presenting “witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, 
or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.” The 
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  
 
 A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This 
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The 
Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it 
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of 
the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be “in terms 
of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the 
applicant concerned.” See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple 
prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG ¶ 18:       
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . 
 
7 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts; and 
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. 
 
 Applicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG ¶¶ 
19(a) and 19(c) as disqualifying conditions.  
 
  Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are 
provided under AG ¶ 20. The following are potentially applicable:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast 
doubt on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely 
beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides 
documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides 
evidence of actions to resolve the issue. 
 
 As Applicant resolved SOR ¶ 1.t, AG ¶ 20(b) applies to that debt.  The remainder 
of Applicant’s SOR debts, however, are unresolved. He has known since February 2016 
that the Government had concerns with his delinquent debts. He did not provide 
corroborating documentation to show that he made a good-faith effort to resolve them or 
that he disputed any of them. His finances are not under control. There is insufficient 
evidence to conclude that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. His failure to 
address his delinquent debts casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and 
good judgment.  AG ¶¶ 20(a), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply to his remaining debts. 
 
Conditions beyond his control, as previously discussed, contributed to Applicant’s 
financial problems. For the full application of AG ¶ 20(b), Applicant must provide 
evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Again, Applicant has not 
provided corroborating documentation of his efforts to resolve his remaining SOR debts. 
There is insufficient evidence to conclude Applicant acted responsibly under his 
circumstances. AG ¶ 20(b) is only partially applicable.   
 
8 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the 
nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        
 
I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all 
the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments 
under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  
 
I have considered Applicant’s honorable military service, prior work for the 
federal government, and his work for various defense contractors since 2005. I have 
considered that he has not had any security infractions or violations since he was first 
granted a security clearance. I have also considered the circumstances that contributed 
to his financial delinquencies.  
 
Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not 
mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.f, 1.o – 1.p, 1.s, 1.u – 1.bb:  Against Applicant 
 
Subparagraphs 1.g - 1.n, 1.q, 1.r:    Withdrawn  
 
Subparagraph 1.t:      For Applicant 
 
 
9 
 
Conclusion 
 
 In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant’s eligibility for a 
security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
