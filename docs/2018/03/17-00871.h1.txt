NOEL, Nichole, Administrative Judge: 
 
On May 1, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of 
Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under the financial considerations 
guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to continue Applicant’s security clearance and recommended that the 
case be submitted to an administrative judge to determine whether to revoke her 
security clearance. Applicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. 
 
The hearing was held on February 15, 2018. After the close of the record, I 
proposed to the parties that this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in 
Applicant’s favor. Neither party objected.2  
 
                                                          
1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, 
signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, 
Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended 
(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, 
implemented on September 1, 2006.   
 
2 Hearing Exhibit III. 
 
 
2 
 
 
The SOR alleged that Applicant was indebted to six creditors for approximately 
$88,762. The Government withdrew SOR allegation 1.c ($1,507). The largest remaining 
debt for $85,328, is the past-due balance on two mortgage loans held by one creditor. 
According to the May 2016 credit report obtained by the Government, one of the 
mortgage accounts was 120 days past due and in foreclosure status. Relying on this 
information, the Government had a good-faith basis for the SOR allegation and 
established a prima facie case that Applicant exhibited a history of financial problems 
and an inability to repay her creditors. AG ¶¶ 19 (a) and (c) apply. However, Applicant 
provided evidence to mitigate the alleged financial concerns. The allegation related to 
the mortgage loans was based on incorrect reporting by the credit bureau. The creditor 
confirmed that over the history of the loans, neither has been $88,000 in arrears nor in 
foreclosure status. Both loans are current and in good standing. The remaining alleged 
debts total approximately $1,927 and have been paid. AG ¶¶ 20 (d) and (e) apply. 
 
Applicant’s financial history does not create doubt about her current reliability, 
trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. I also gave 
due consideration to the whole-person concept. Applicant has held a security clearance 
continuously since 1998, without incident. She has met her ultimate burden of 
production and persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant her continued eligibility for access to classified information.
