Decision 
______________ 
 
MARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: 
 
This case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 9, 
2014. On January 23, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications 
Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns 
under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; 
DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review 
Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines 
(AG) implemented by the DOD on September 1, 2006 (2006 AG). 
 
Applicant answered the SOR on February 17, 2017, and requested a hearing 
before an administrative judge. The Government was ready to proceed on March 21, 
2017, and the case was assigned to me on November 9, 2017. On January 12, 2018, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing 
was scheduled for February 1, 2018. The hearing was convened as scheduled. 
Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted into evidence, without objection. 
The Government’s exhibit list was appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE I) and 
a letter that the Government sent to Applicant as HE II. At the hearing, Applicant 
testified and submitted Applicant’s Exhibits (AE) A through X, which were admitted into 
 
2 
 
evidence, without objection. At Applicant’s request, I left the record open until February 
15, 2018. Applicant timely provided additional documents that were admitted into 
evidence as AE Y through DD, without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on 
February 9, 2018. 
 
On June 8, 2017, the DOD implemented new AG (2017 AG).1 Accordingly, I have 
applied the 2017 AG.2 However, I have also considered the 2006 AG, because they 
were in effect on the date the SOR was issued. I conclude that my decision would have 
been the same under the either version. 
 
SOR Amendment 
 
 At the hearing, I granted Department Counsel’s motion, without objection, to 
amend the SOR to withdraw paragraph 1.n.3 
 
Findings of Fact4 
 
Applicant, age 35, and his wife of 11 years divorced in 2013. They had been 
separated since 2012. He remarried in 2016. He has two children, ages nine and three. 
He has taken some college courses. Applicant honorably served in the Marine Corps 
from 2001 through 2010. He has been employed by a defense contractor since 2010, at 
which time he was granted a security clearance.5 
 
The SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts totaling $9,349 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.m), 
and that Applicant failed to file, as required, his federal and state income tax returns for 
tax years 2013 and 2014 and pay the associated taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.o. and 1.p). In his 
SOR answer, Applicant admitted each of the SOR allegations except for SOR ¶¶ 1.b 
through 1.e and 1.m, which are established by credit reports submitted by the 
Government.6 His admitted debt totals $8,003. 
 
                                                          
1 On December 10, 2016, the Security Executive Agent issued Directive 4 (SEAD 4), establishing a 
“single, common adjudicative criteria for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility 
for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position.” (SEAD 4 ¶ B, Purpose). The 
SEAD 4 became effective on June 8, 2017 (SEAD 4 ¶ F, Effective Date). The new AG, which are found at 
Appendix A to SEAD 4, apply to determine eligibility for initial or continued access to classified national 
security information. (SEAD 4 ¶ C, Applicability).

debt relates to a different person of the same name and 
would notify credit bureaus. Creditor never notified credit 
bureaus, as promised, so Applicant plans to initiate his

$584 Resolving. Applicant established a payment agreement 
in Feb 2017 (balance then $760): $50 per month via 
auto-pay. When he realized auto-pay stopped, he re-
established the agreement again in Jan 2018 (balance 
then $518). His monthly payments are scheduled to 
begin on Jan 31, 2018 via automatic payments.14 
L medical $467 Resolved. Applicant made payments pursuant to an 
agreement, which resolved the debt by Jan 2018.15  
M medical $642 Resolved. Paid in Feb 2017.16 
 
Applicant initially failed to timely file his 2013 federal and state income tax returns 
because he forgot. He anticipated filing them with his 2014 tax returns, but then realized 
that he needed more time to get his finances in order so that he could afford to pay the 
anticipated taxes. He eventually filed for both years in early 2017, at which time he also 
proposed an installment agreement to the IRS to pay the approximately $4,534 that he 
owed. Instead, it was resolved by the IRS’s interception of Applicant’s tax year 2016 
refund. He intends to file future tax returns on time, as he did in tax years 2015 and 
2016.17 In March 2017, the IRS accepted the earlier-proposed installment agreement to 
repay 2012 taxes owed, of which Applicant had previously been unaware. He was 
current with those payments as of January 2018. Applicant did not owe the state for any 
unpaid taxes.18 
 
Applicant attributed his failure to timely file tax returns and his delinquent tax and 
other debts to his 2012 separation, at which time he had to maintain two households on 
a single income and pay child support. His tax bills were also higher than usual because 
his ex-wife claimed their daughter as a dependent. Because his ex-wife bore primary 
responsibility for the family’s finances, Applicant had not been aware that they had so 
many unpaid bills. As he became aware of the debts (mostly after receiving the SOR), 
he initiated efforts to resolve them. Together with his new wife, Applicant has developed 
a financial management plan to ensure that they are debt-free within the next two to 
three years.19

Applicant was deployed to combat zones three times, and received numerous 
commendations and medals for his outstanding military service.20 Applicant’s current 
supervisor praised his character, work performance, and trustworthiness.21  
 
Policies 
 
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”22 As Commander in Chief, the 
President has the authority to “control access to information bearing on national security 
and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information.”23 The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee 
to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”24 
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, 
recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these 
guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative 
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the 
person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. 
 
 The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard 
classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible 
extrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified 
information. 
 
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in 
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”25 Thus, a 
decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not met 
the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for 
issuing a clearance.

 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in 
the personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant 
from being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden 
of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.26 “Substantial evidence” is “more 
than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”27 The guidelines presume a nexus or 
rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and 
an applicant’s security suitability.28 Once the Government establishes a disqualifying 
condition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, 
extenuate, or mitigate the facts.29 An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating 
condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government.30 
   
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent 
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.”31 “[S]ecurity 
clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”32 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F (Financial Considerations) 
 
The concern under this guideline is set out in AG ¶ 18: 
 
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage.

 This concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly 
compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a 
person’s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified 
information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, 
unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See 
ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). 
 
 Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal and state income returns and pay the 
associated taxes, and his financial indebtedness establish three disqualifying conditions 
under this guideline: AG ¶ 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG ¶ 19(c) (a history of not 
meeting financial obligations); and AG ¶ 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual 
Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or 
local income tax as required).  
 
 The security concerns raised in the SOR have been mitigated by the following 
applicable factors: 
 
AG ¶ 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or 
occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not 
cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good 
judgment; 
 
AG ¶ 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were 
largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business 
downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, 
clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
AG ¶ 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to 
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
 
AG ¶ 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate 
tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with 
those arrangements. 
 
Applicant filed his 2013 through 2014 tax returns and resolved the associated tax 
debt well before the hearing. He established a meaningful track record of repaying his 
2012 taxes to the IRS. Applicant intends to file future tax returns on time, as he did in 
tax years 2015 and 2016. I conclude that these issues are not likely to recur.  
 
  Applicant made substantial progress in resolving his SOR debts, which largely 
resulted from circumstances beyond his control. He resolved the debts alleged in SOR 
¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.g through 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m, and is in the process of resolving the debt 
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k. There remain only four unresolved medical debts totaling $381 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f), for which Applicant has a good faith basis to dispute. Given 
the facts and circumstances underlying his financial issues, and in light of the 
responsible manner in which he addressed them, I conclude that they are not likely to 
 
8 
 
recur. Even if the unresolved debts were deemed security significant, Applicant’s 
actions with respect to his previous delinquent debts and tax issues demonstrate that he 
would resolve them as necessary. He is otherwise managing his finances responsibly. I 
have no doubt about Applicant’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing 
of national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security 
must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the 
following guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. 
An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at 
AG ¶ 2(d): 
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of 
rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation 
for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or 
duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person 
analysis, and I have considered the factors in AG ¶ 2(d). Applicant has served the 
military honorably on active duty, including three combat tours, and as a civilian 
contractor. He was candid and sincere at the hearing, and is highly regarded for his 
trustworthiness and good character. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating 
conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole 
person, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to 
timely file tax returns, and to pay taxes and other debts. Accordingly, Applicant has 
carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to 
grant him eligibility for access to classified information. 
 
Formal Findings 
 
I make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: 
 
Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):   FOR APPLICANT 
 
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.m:  For Applicant 
 
Subparagraph 1.n:   Withdrawn 
 
Subparagraphs 1.o – 1.p:  For Applicant

Conclusion 
 
I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant 
eligibility for access to classified information.  Clearance is granted.
