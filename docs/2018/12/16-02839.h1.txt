Decision 
___________ 
 
BENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations). Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant’s failure to timely file 
Federal and state income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax 
delinquencies and unresolved promissory note, and the length of time they have been 
unresolved, Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance is denied.  
 
Statement of the Case 
  
On February 5, 2015, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). 
On May 23, 2017, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD 
CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns 
under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive 
Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 
1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security 
Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the 
adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September 1, 2006. On June 8, 
2017, new AGs were implemented and are effective for decisions issued after that date.1  
 
                                            
1 I considered the previous AGs, effective September 1, 2006, as well as the new AGs, effective June 8, 
2017. My decision would be the same if the case was considered under the previous AGs.

On September 21, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR, and requested a 
hearing. On March 28, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On June 28, 2018, the 
Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the 
hearing for July 25, 2018. Applicant’s hearing was held as scheduled.  
  
During the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits, Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1-7, and Applicant offered ten exhibits, Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-J. There 
were no objections, and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. On August 2, 
2018, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied all eight allegations set forth in SOR ¶¶ 
1.a through 1.h.   
 
Applicant is a 57-year-old licensed attorney. He honorably served in the U.S. Air 
Force on active duty from 1986 through 1992. Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 
1985, a master’s degree in 1987, and a juris doctorate in 2003. He is married and has 
one adult child. He is sponsored for national security eligibility by a DOD contractor, for 
which Applicant is the Chief Executive Officer. (CEO) (Tr. 8-9; GE 1) 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file state and Federal income tax 
returns for multiple years. He owes three state tax debts, three Federal tax debts, and he 
has an unsatisfied judgment. The combined total of Applicant’s delinquent indebtedness 
is approximately $802,288. The record establishes the status of Applicant’s unpaid 
accounts and untimely tax returns as follows: 
 
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant failed to file state and Federal income tax returns for 
tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. He denied this allegation 
in his SOR response because he has since filed all of his state and Federal income tax 
returns. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant did not timely 
file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 
2008, 2011, and 2012, as required. The income tax returns for tax year 2003 was filed in 
2006, and the income tax returns for tax years 2004 through 2008 were filed in 2009. Tax 
years 2011 and 2012 income tax returns were filed in May 2014. (Tr. 10 -13, 49, 55, 89-
91) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, c, and d allege Applicant had two state tax liens entered against him 
in 2013, and another state tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total 
amount of $37,097. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The 
testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant’s state tax liens are unpaid 
and unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, and f allege Applicant had a Federal tax lien entered against him in 
2009, and another Federal tax lien entered against him in 2016, in the combined total 
 
3 
                                         
 
amount of $654,148. Applicant denied these allegations in his response to the SOR. The 
testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that Applicant’s Federal tax liens are 
unpaid and unresolved. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent 
2005 income taxes in the amount of $20,225. He denied this allegation in his response to 
the SOR. The testimony and evidence at the hearing showed that the Federal 
Government is currently claiming approximately $860,000 for Applicant’s combined 
delinquent Federal taxes. Applicant initiated a one-year repayment agreement to pay 
$500 per month to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) four weeks before his hearing. At 
the time of his hearing, Applicant had not yet made any payments to the IRS for resolution 
of these delinquent taxes. (Tr. 15, 50, 72, 88, 92-93, 95; AE H; AE J) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant owes on a bank promissory note in the amount of 
$90,818. The bank filed a lawsuit against him in October 2014 to collect this debt. He 
denied this allegation in his response to the SOR. The testimony and evidence at the 
hearing showed that this case is still pending litigation and the debt is unresolved. 
Applicant believes that he has repaid this debt in full and possibly overpaid the debt, but 
he failed to provide evidence at the hearing showing his history of payments on this 
account. Applicant claimed that he never received any statements from the bank and the 
payments on this note were automatically deducted from his bank account for years. He 
called his law partner as a witness since she represented Applicant during the litigation 
of the alleged promissory note, now valued at approximately $150,000. (Tr. 39) She 
testified that the lawsuit was pending, and if she filed a motion to dismiss the case, she 
believed it would most likely be granted by the court. As of the date of the hearing, 
Applicant’s attorney had not filed a motion to dismiss the case, and there was no evidence 
presented of Applicant’s claimed payments on this account. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 
20-21, 25-31, 33-35, 40, 77-78; AE A - G) 
 
Applicant stated that his financial problems stem from a catastrophic, million-dollar 
loss from a fire that damaged his rental property in 2003. He received a letter from his 
insurance company the very day the fire occurred advising him that the insurance 
company would no longer insure his rental properties. Applicant suffered a heart attack 
shortly thereafter. He was financially ruined, and he borrowed $60,000 from his friends to 
survive. Applicant reported that he has repaid all that borrowed money to his friends. (Tr. 
10, 92) 
 
Applicant’s office also burned in the fire, and he lost all business records. He did 
not timely file state or Federal income tax returns for 2003, but he eventually filed those 
income tax returns. He did not file his state and Federal income tax returns for tax year 
2004 because he was depressed, and he was on the verge of financial ruin. Applicant 
eventually hired a certified public accountant (CPA). The CPA took Applicant’s tax records 
and money, and made an appearance on his behalf before the IRS. About a year and a 
half later, the CPA kept the money, returned the tax records to Applicant, and told him he 
could not help Applicant with his tax issues.  (Tr. 10-11) 
 
 
4 
                                         
 
Applicant hired a second CPA in about 2005, and he immediately noticed that his 
income tax returns were finally being filed. The IRS requested to do an audit of Applicant’s 
filed 2009 and 2010 income tax returns. Applicant testified that he and his CPA met with 
an IRS representative. The IRS representative had Applicant sign a Power of Attorney 
(POA) for his CPA, and then she advised him that she would reschedule the audit. 
Applicant claimed the IRS representative instructed him not to open his mail from 
the IRS because it would only upset him.  He thought that the IRS representative would 
send the notices of the audits to Applicant and Applicant’s tax representative(s), the CPA 
and eventually Applicant’s sister, who is an IRS enrolled agent and was also added to 
Applicant’s POA. (Tr. 11-13, 65-66, 84-85, 90) 
 
After an extended period of time, Applicant contacted his CPA to determine his 
current tax status. The IRS audits for tax years 2009-2010 and 2012-2013 had already 
occurred when Applicant learned that the IRS failed to provide any notices of the audits 
to his tax representative(s). Applicant admitted that he had received an envelope from the 
IRS that contained the audit notice for both of his audits. He did not open any mail from 
the IRS based on the advice he received from the IRS representative. Since no one 
appeared at the hearing for Applicant’s Federal tax audits, all expenses reported on 
Applicant’s 2009-2010, and 2012-2013 income tax returns were disallowed by the IRS for 
tax write-offs. (Tr. 12-13, 44, 64-70; AE I) 
 
Applicant’s sister, who is a tax expert, testified as a witness. She stated that the 
IRS agent’s letter (AE I) pointed out that Applicant’s CPA would not have been provided 
a notice of the tax audit since her name was added to the POA in about 2016, which 
essentially cancelled the CPA on the POA. She also stated that, at one point in time, the 
CPA and she were both listed on the POA, but in late 2016 Applicant took action to have 
the CPA’s name removed from the POA. She believed Applicant’s two audits, for tax 
years 2009-2010 and 2012-2013, took place prior to her name being added on the POA, 
so she would not have received any of the audit notices. She did state that Applicant’s 
CPA would have received these audit notices prior 2016. (Tr. 53) She testified that her 
brother had talked with his CPA about the audit hearings and the CPA said he had it 
handled. The CPA had obviously received the audit notices but he was not appearing at 
the audit hearings, as he told her brother.2 (Tr. 58-59, 61) The audit for 2009-2010 tax 
years would have most likely taken place in 2011 or 2012, and the audit for 2012-2013 
would have most likely taken place in 2014 or 2015. Applicant’s sister filed Applicant’s 
2016 and 2017 income tax returns. She stated that her brother owed taxes for both of 
those tax years, but he did not pay the Federal taxes owed because he did not have the 
funds. (Tr. 62)  She submitted a request for an audit reconsideration in September 2017 
but, as of the date of the hearing, the IRS had not yet responded to that request. (Tr. 42-
47, 52-55, 58-63, 72; AE H; AE I) 
 
                                            
2 Applicant’s sister’s testimony conflicts with Applicant’s testimony that his CPA did not receive any audit 
notices from the IRS. Applicant claimed that after the audits were over and no one appeared, he then 
received information from the IRS that showed he owed a horrendous amount of Federal taxes for those 
audited tax years. He admitted that he received the audit notices from the IRS. Applicant stated that his 
sister’s testimony was in error. (Tr. 64-68, 73-74)  
 
5 
                                         
 
Applicant stated that the total amount of Federal and state delinquent taxes were 
merely unrealistic numbers due to his disallowed expenses. Applicant wishes to have his 
tax issues resolved so he can pay the actual tax money that is owed and be in complete 
compliance. His most recent notice from the IRS disclosed that he currently owes 
approximately $860,000 for Federal tax liabilities. (Tr. 15, 50, 72) Applicant recently set-
up a one-year repayment plan with the IRS covering tax years 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 
2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, which includes all of the tax years with 
delinquent Federal taxes owed. As of the date of his hearing, he had not yet made any 
payments on the one-year repayment plan. He noted that the state tax authority relies on 
the Federal Government to determine an individual’s tax liability. Once the Federal tax 
numbers are correctly calculated, the state tax authority will then reset his state taxes, 
interest, and penalties numbers. He has not yet made any payments on his outstanding 
state taxes. (Tr. 13-15, 48-51; 61-62, 71, 76, 87-88; AE H, J) 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules 
of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge’s 
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An 
administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, 
past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Adverse 
clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely based on whether the applicant has met the strict guidelines the 
 
6 
                                         
 
President, Secretary of Defense, and Security Executive Agent have established for 
issuing a clearance. 
  
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” 
ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a 
mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 
(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, 
on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F: Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: 
 
Failure to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially 
overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise 
questionable acts to generate funds. . . . 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I 
have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG ¶ 19, and the following 
are potentially applicable: 
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
 
7 
                                         
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income 
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
The evidence shows that Applicant did not timely file his Federal and state income 
tax returns for tax years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012. The 
evidence also shows that he owes over $800,000 for delinquent taxes and an unresolved 
promissory note pending litigation. The above disqualifying conditions apply. 
 
The Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial 
considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012),  
as follows: 
 
This concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might 
knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in 
satisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the 
totality of an applicant’s financial history and circumstances. The Judge 
must consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant’s self-control, 
judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as 
well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive 
presumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines 
and an applicant’s security eligibility.  
 
  Five financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially 
applicable in this case:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago,3 was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control;  
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and 
                                            
3 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an applicant’s 
ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for 
purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) 
(citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
8 
                                         
 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements.  
 
Applicant has not resolved his significant delinquent tax debt; nor has he paid, 
settled, or resolved the bank promissory note pending litigation. He just recently entered 
into a one-year repayment agreement with the IRS but has not yet started making his 
monthly payments. Although he provided mitigating evidence of a fire and health 
concerns during the 2003-2004 time period, which were circumstances beyond his 
control, he does not have a reasonable explanation as to why he has been unable to 
resolve his tax issues during the past 14 years. Given the heavy burden generated by his 
failure to timely file income tax returns or pay income taxes, the length of time the taxes 
have been outstanding, and Applicant’s unsubstantiated promise to resolve his debts, I 
cannot conclude that he has mitigated any of the financial considerations security 
concerns. There are no indications that his tax and other financial problems are under 
control, and I find it probable that future issues are likely to occur. Mitigation under AG ¶¶ 
20(a), (b), (c), (d) and 20(g) was not established. 
 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
     Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security 
eligibility must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are 
incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(d) were 
addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. 
 
 Looking at the totality of Applicant’s tax history and circumstances, the evidence 
clearly shows that he does not possess the requisite good judgment, responsibility, and 
trustworthiness required by individuals entrusted with protecting our nation’s secrets. 
Applicant is a licensed attorney and should be expected to know and comply with his 
obligations under Federal and state tax laws. His self-serving explanation that he did not 
open any mail from the IRS, to include important notices of his pending IRS audits, based 
 
9 
                                         
 
on an unsubstantiated and implausible claim concerning IRS representative’s bad advice 
is purely irresponsible and unreasonable. 
 
Given the nature and seriousness of Applicant’s failure to timely file Federal and 
state income tax returns for numerous years, his significant outstanding tax and bank loan 
delinquencies, and the length of time they have been unresolved, I conclude Applicant 
has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  
 
Formal Findings 
 
Formal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, 
as required by ¶ E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
  
Paragraph 1, Guideline F:     AGAINST APPLICANT  
 
Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  Against Applicant 
 
          Conclusion 
 
In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or reinstate Applicant’s eligibility for 
a security clearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is 
denied.
