Decision 
______________ 
GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
Applicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. 
Statement of the Case 
On February 3, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On November 29, 2017, 
the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a 
Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, 
Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and 
modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance 
Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 
4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines 
(December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued 
eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, 
effective June 8, 2017.

The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial 
Considerations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an 
affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest 
to grant Applicant’s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract 
with the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine 
whether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on December 18, 2017. In a sworn statement, dated 
January 31, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to 
proceed on March 5, 2018. The case was assigned to me on March 20, 2018. A Notice 
of Hearing was issued on June 29, 2018, scheduling the hearing for July 24, 2018. I 
convened the hearing as scheduled. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 3 and Administrative 
exhibit I were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant did not offer any 
Applicant exhibits (AE). Applicant testified. Based on information presented during the 
hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding the following 
language: “You failed to timely file your annual federal income tax returns for tax years 
2012 through 2015.” There was no objection to the motion, and the motion was granted, 
thereby amending the SOR by adding SOR ¶ 1.b.1 The transcript (Tr.) was received on 
August 2, 2018. I kept the record open to enable Applicant to supplement it. He took 
advantage of that opportunity and timely submitted documents, which were marked and 
admitted into evidence as AE A through AE M without objection. The record closed on 
August 20, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the initial 
SOR (SOR ¶ 1.a.). Applicant did not admit or deny SOR ¶ 1.b., but merely acknowledged 
and conceded the concerns, so a denial was registered as to that allegation. Applicant’s 
admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete 
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, 
I make the following additional findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving 
as a systems analyst with his current employer since December 2016. He is a 1988 high 
school graduate, and received an associate’s degree in 1992. In 1995-1996, he was an 
ordained minister. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a 
position of public trust. Applicant was married in 1996, separated in 2014, and divorced 
in 2017. He remarried in April 2018. He has two children, born in 1999 and 2001.

Financial Considerations2 
 
Applicant attributed his financial problems to several different factors: he had 
personal family life issues involving a wife who lost her teaching position; she 
mismanaged their money and “self-medicated” by spending money on clothing and eating 
out; she totaled her vehicle; estate tax issues arose involving an estate inherited by his 
wife; more tax issues arose in 2011 over capital gains when he cashed in a pension plan 
to generate funds to enable him to resolve some of his growing financial debt; their house 
was foreclosed in 2013; he was unemployed from May 2014 until August 2014; his federal 
income tax refund for the tax year 2016 was withheld by the Internal Revenue Service 
(IRS) and applied to his outstanding tax debt; and Applicant and his wife were separated 
for three years before finally divorcing. In addition, although they shared custody of the 
children, Applicant kept physical custody of their children and did not receive any financial 
support from his wife.3  
 
When Applicant completed his e-QIP in February 2017, he reported that he had 
failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 
2015, and that he had failed to pay his federal and state taxes for the same period.4 
However, during his interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel 
Management (OPM) in August 2017, Applicant changed the narrative and contended he 
had timely filed his income tax returns for that period, and was sent refunds, claiming his 
e-QIP entries were in error.5 In his Answer to the SOR and during the hearing, Applicant 
acknowledged that the filings had not yet taken place.6 Although he claimed that he had, 
at one point, entered into an Installment Agreement with the IRS, he acknowledged that 
he had failed to make any payments under it for fear that his checks might bounce. He 
also denied that he has been in contact, in writing or by telephone, with the IRS for 
approximately five years for anything associated with those tax years.7 During his hearing, 
Applicant said that he was now in a position to start paying his delinquent taxes and some 
retail credit debt about which he was not aware.8

delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and 
otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 
2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

In August 2018, Applicant asserted that he had finally filed his federal income tax 
returns for the tax years 2010 through 2016.9 The U.S. Individual Income Tax Return 
(Form 1040) for 2010, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $82,032, was dated August 
1, 2018;10 the Forms 1040 for 2011, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $76,945,11 
and 2012, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $76,969,12 were dated August 2, 2018; 
the Form 1040 for 2013, reflecting an adjusted gross income of $46,229, was dated 
August 3, 2018;13 the Form 1040 for 2014, reflecting an adjusted gross income of 
$58,427, was dated August 5, 2018;14 and the Forms 1040 for 2015, reflecting an 
adjusted gross income of $72,246,15 and 2016, reflecting an adjusted gross income of 
$72,515,16 were dated August 6, 2018 – all clearly beyond the required initial or extended 
dates of filing.17 
 
On August 10, 2018, Applicant submitted an Installment Agreement Request 
(Form 9465) to the IRS, stating that he owed the IRS $12,506 in unpaid taxes, interest, 
and penalties, and offered to pay the IRS a monthly $340 under the requested

             17 The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual’s gross 
income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, the 
following applies: 
 
Any person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title 
or by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or 
supply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such 
return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law 
or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a 
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 
($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, 
together with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom 
there is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with 
respect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect 
to such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first 
sentence of this section shall be applied by substituting "felony" for "misdemeanor" and "5 
years" for "1 year."

agreement.18 He sent a check to the IRS for $300 that same day.19 Applicant offered no 
documentation from the IRS to indicate that his Installment Agreement Request had been 
approved. In addition, he offered no explanation for paying the IRS less than he had 
promised to pay under the Installment Agreement Request, or if he had continued making 
subsequent payments in compliance with the proposed Request. 
 
In addition to his difficulties with respect to his federal income tax returns and the 
taxes he still owes the IRS, Applicant also had two delinquent debts that were not alleged 
in the SOR.20 Although one account became delinquent in 2011 and the other account 
became delinquent in 2017, and at least one of them was discussed during his OPM 
interview in August 2017, Applicant did not attempt to resolve one debt until he made a 
payment of $295.94 on July 31, 2018, thereby paying it off.21 During the hearing, he 
discussed the other, earlier debt, and stated that he intended to get it resolved as well, 
but he offered no evidence to indicate that any further efforts to do so had been made.  
In August 2018, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement to indicate 
monthly income, monthly expenses, and debts. He reported $7,609 in combined net 
monthly income; and $5,410 in monthly expenses, including $320 in federal taxes. Among 
his debts are monthly payments of $430 on his Lexus vehicle. He reported a monthly 
remainder of $419 available for discretionary spending or savings.22  
There is no evidence that Applicant has ever received financial counseling. While 
there is evidence of two recent, post-hearing payments on both SOR and non-SOR 
delinquent debts, nearly a year after the SOR was issued, and there is evidence of a 
modest monthly remainder, there is little meaningful evidence to indicate that Applicant’s 
financial situation is now under control.

20 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal 
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to 
evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider 
whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular 
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis 
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also

Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged 
delinquent accounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a [position of public trust].”23 As Commander in Chief, the President 
has the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained 
in the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.24  
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a public trust position, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying 
conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for a public trust position. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common 
sense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables 
known as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all 
available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and 
unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”25 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.26  
                                                          
23 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). 
 
24 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for 
Counterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, 
covers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense 
Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for 
trustworthiness determinations. 
 
25 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 
at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla 
but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994). 
 
26 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).

A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance 
determinations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on 
the side of denials.27 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that 
are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I 
have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations 
 
The trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations 
is set out in AG ¶ 18:  
      
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage. 
 
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns 
under AG ¶19:  
 
(a) inability to satisfy debts; 
 
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
 
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and 
 
                                                          
27 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
 
 
8 
                                      
 
(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      
tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as 
required. 
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 
through 2015 until August 2018, well after the SOR was issued; failed to pay annual 
federal individual income taxes as required; and, as of August 2018, according to 
Applicant, he still owed the IRS $12,506 in unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties. Applicant 
contended that his failure to timely file those federal income tax returns was because he 
did not have sufficient funds to pay his taxes. The requirement to file is separate from the 
requirement to pay. The failure to timely file income tax returns has security and 
trustworthiness implications because:28  
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
The Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has 
purportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that an applicant is now 
motivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration 
of an applicant’s security worthiness, or by inference trustworthiness, in light of his or her 
longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file 
federal income tax returns.29 In this instance, while Applicant may now be properly 
motivated, and he has finally taken the appropriate actions to actually file his federal 
income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2015, there is still insufficient evidence 
to demonstrate that he is paying his back taxes. AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been 
established, and AG ¶ 19(b) has been partially established.

no foul” approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employing an “all’s well that ends well” analysis 
as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of filing of tax 
returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
 
9 
                                      
 
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate 
trustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20: 
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;30 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;31  
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is compliance with those arrangements. 
  
                                                          
30 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). 
 
31 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or 
statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

AG ¶ 20(b) partially applies, but none of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. 
The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties make it 
difficult to conclude that it occurred “so long ago” or “was so infrequent,” or that it is 
“unlikely to recur.” Applicant generally attributed his financial difficulties to an ex-wife’s 
various issues; his own problems in 2011 over capital gains taxes when he cashed in a 
pension plan to generate funds to enable him to resolve some of his growing financial 
debt; their house was foreclosed in 2013; he was unemployed from May 2014 until August 
2014; his federal income tax refund for the tax year 2016 was withheld by the IRS and 
applied to his outstanding tax debt; and Applicant and his wife were separated for three 
years before finally divorcing. While those are factors, without more details as how they 
impacted Applicant’s finances, it is difficult to determine to what degree they were largely 
beyond his control, or how he dealt with them. 
However, they separated in 2014, and with the exception of the tax years 2013 
and 2014, Applicant’s annual adjusted gross income improved and was generally in 
excess of $72,000. While his federal income tax returns were finally filed in August 2018, 
there is limited evidence that he made any reasonable efforts to file his income tax returns 
or voluntarily pay his back taxes until well after the SOR was issued as well as after the 
hearing was conducted. There is no evidence of a budget. There is no evidence of any 
financial counseling. There is no evidence of disputes. Applicant offered some evidence 
to indicate that his financial situation is now under better control. Applicant’s actions under 
the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good 
judgment.32 
Trustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, 
reliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines 
do not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the 
SOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take 
significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant 
immediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, 
nor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. 
Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such 
debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the 
future, especially after a multi-year delay in taking any action, without further confirmed 
action, are insufficient. 
An applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed 
on notice that his or her eligibility for a public trust position is in jeopardy may be lacking 
in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there 
is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.33 In this instance, to date, there is 
minimal meaningful evidence that corrective actions have been taken by Applicant. While 
Applicant claimed to have insufficient funds to pay his federal or state income tax over

several years, or to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 
2015, the evidence regarding his adjusted gross income over a substantial period reveals 
that his adjusted gross income appears to be more than sufficient to make at least some 
modest payments well before the SOR was issued. Purchasing a Lexus seems to indicate 
there were some funds available to make those modest tax payments. Applicant’s 
actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.34 
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the 
applicant’s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider 
the nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant 
eligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based 
upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I 
have evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record 
evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.35  
  
There is some evidence mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant is a 49-year-old 
employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a systems analyst with his 
current employer since December 2016. Although he failed to timely file his federal 
income tax returns for the tax years 2012 through 2015, he finally filed them in August 
2018. He also reached out to the IRS and requested an Installment Agreement. Applicant 
made one modest tax payment to the IRS. He also paid off one non-SOR debt. He has 
$419 available each month for discretionary spending or savings.  
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the tax years 2010 through 
2015 until August 2018, well after the SOR was issued; failed to pay annual federal 
individual income taxes as required; and, as of August 2018, he still owed the IRS $12,506 
                                                          
34 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). 
 
35 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-

in unpaid taxes, interest, and penalties. He did not engage the IRS over his unfiled income 
tax returns for five years, and did not request an Installment Agreement until after the 
hearing was held. He made one modest payment to the IRS and another modest payment 
to resolve a non-SOR debt after the hearing. Considering all of the above, I am unable to 
reach a positive conclusion pertaining to Applicant’s eligibility for a position of public trust. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:36 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
 
Applicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts, seemingly avoiding the filing of his federal income tax returns for 
several years as well as failing to make income tax payments, until well after the SOR 
was issued. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to 
Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his 
financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). 
 
Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:  Against Applicant

Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of 
public trust to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility is denied.
