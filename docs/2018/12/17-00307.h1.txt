GALES, Robert Robinson, Administrative Judge: 
 
Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns regarding financial 
considerations. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. 
 
Statement of the Case 
 
On October 1, 2015, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted an 
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security 
Clearance Application. On March 9, 2017, the Department of Defense (DOD) 
Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, 
under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense 
Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended 
and modified (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For 
Access to Classified Information (December 29, 2005) applicable to all adjudications and 
other determinations made under the Directive, effective September 1, 2006.1 
                                                          
 
  
  
2  
                                        
The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), 
and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly 
consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. 
The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  
 
 Applicant received the SOR on March 31, 2017. In a notarized statement, dated 
April 17, 2017, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an 
administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to 
proceed on May 5, 2017. The case was initially assigned to another administrative judge 
in June 2017, but was eventually reassigned to me on March 20, 2018.  A Notice of 
Hearing was issued on August 28, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on 
September 25, 2018. 
 
 During the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and Applicant 
exhibits (AE) A through AE G were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant 
testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 4, 2018. I kept the record open to 
enable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely 
submitted several documents, which were marked and admitted as AE H through AE Z, 
without objection. The record closed on October 30, 2018. 
 
Findings of Fact 
 In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual 
allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e.). 
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a 
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration 
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  
 
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving 
as an information systems service operations manager since around 1994 with a business 
unit of one company that was eventually purchased by another company. A 1981 high 
school graduate, Applicant earned some college credits, but no degree. He enlisted in the 
U.S. Air Force in August 1981, and he served on active duty until he was honorably 
discharged in December 1991 as a Staff Sergeant (E-5). He was granted a secret 
clearance in 1981, and has retained that clearance except for periods when he possessed 
a top secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI). 
Applicant was married in July 1985, separated in August 2012, and divorced in December 
2016. He started cohabiting in September 2014, and in October 2017, he was again 
married. He has two daughters, born in 1991 and 2001. 
                                                          
1 Effective June 8, 2017, by Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), dated December 
10, 2016, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or 
continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, were 
established to supersede all previously issued national security adjudicative criteria or guidelines. 
Accordingly, those guidelines previously implemented on September 1, 2006, under which this security 
clearance review case was initiated, no longer apply. In comparing the two versions, there is no substantial 
difference that might have a negative effect on Applicant in this case.

Military Service, Awards, and Decorations  
  
During his military service, Applicant was deployed from August 1990 until 
February 1991 in support of Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm. He was awarded 
the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, the Air Force 
Achievement Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Air Force Outstanding Unit 
Award, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal (with two clusters), the National Defense 
Service Medal, the Air Force Overseas Short Tour Ribbon, the Air Force Overseas Long 
Tour Ribbon, the Air Force Longevity Service Award Ribbon, the Non-Commissioned 
Officer Professional Military Education Graduate Ribbon, the Small Arms Expert 
Marksmanship Ribbon, and the Air Force Training Ribbon.2  
 
 Financial Considerations3 
  
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to several different issues that initially 
arose in or about mid-2012: he and his wife separated, leading to a lengthy and costly 
divorce; he was required to maintain two households during the period of separation; he 
was ordered to pay child support and alimony; his employer was unsuccessful in re-
competing  on a contract, and he was initially issued a layoff notice; he was subsequently 
offered a new position with the same employer which required that he relocate, at his own 
expense, to a different state;4 and although his primary residence was on the market for 
over six months, it did not sell. Because of the additional unexpected expenses, 
insufficient funds caused him to fall behind on his mortgage. Although Applicant 
attempted to obtain mortgage relief through the Home Affordable Modification Program 
(HAMP) in August 2015,5 and offered to include a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, nothing 
worked, and the property was eventually foreclosed.  
The SOR identified five purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed for 
collection, charged off, or foreclosed as generally reflected by Applicant’s November 2015 
credit report or December 2016 credit report. Those debts total approximately $272,220. 
The current status of those accounts, is as follows.  
 (SOR ¶ 1.a.): This is a bank-issued home mortgage loan with a high credit of 
$261,506 and an unpaid balance of $244,414 (of which $11,726 was past due), that was 
                                                          
2 AE H (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty (DD Form 214), dated December 11, 
1991).

the following exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated October 1, 2015); GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated 
January 7, 2016); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 10, 
2015); GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 20, 2016); and Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, dated 
April 17, 2017.

eventually sold at foreclosure in June 2016.6 Although there was an in personam 
deficiency judgment balance of $24,777 against Applicant as of October 20, 2016, the 
amount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be paid by Applicant and his 
ex-wife.7 Applicant stopped making his monthly payments in July 2015, in anticipation of 
a layoff, has not yet made any payments on this account after the foreclosure because 
he supposedly had insufficient funds to do so,8 and his ex-wife has avoided paying her 
share by filing a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.9 
The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶ 1.b.): This is a bank-issued line of credit with an unpaid and past-due 
balance of $27,059 that was placed for collection and charged off in 2016.10 As with the 
home mortgage loan, the amount was considered by the court to be a marital debt to be 
paid by Applicant and his ex-wife.11 Applicant’s ex-wife has avoided paying her share by 
filing a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Applicant 
initially contended that he had entered into an agreement with a particular company that 
purchased the account,12 but that payment agreement to which he refers is a credit-card 
account with the same creditor, in the amount of $11,674, that was not alleged in the 
SOR, which was also considered to be a marital debt to be paid by both Applicant and 
his ex-wife.13 Although he said he would reach out to the creditor in an effort to set up 
repayment arrangements,14 to date, he has offered no evidence that he has done so.15 
The account has not been resolved. 
 
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c. through 1.e.): These are three medical accounts with unpaid 
balances of $430, $195, and $122 that were placed for collection.16 Applicant paid the 
largest and the smallest accounts, for a total of $553, in April 2017,17 and he paid the

remaining account, in the amount of $195, in January 2017.18 The accounts have been 
resolved.   
In addition to the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR, there are additional 
delinquent accounts not alleged in the SOR19  for which Applicant is either completely or 
partially responsible. His divorce decree identified the joint bank-issued credit card with 
an unpaid balance of $11,674 which was referred to above for which there is a payment 
plan calling for preauthorized monthly payments of $121.60 commencing in April 2017;20 
and there is a bank-issued credit card in his ex-wife’s name, also considered a marital 
debt, with an unpaid balance of $21,438.21 Applicant referred to other credit cards for both 
his ex-wife and himself for which he was making payments, and that he managed to get 
one account paid off. He submitted documentation to support his position that one such 
past-due account for $2,769 was settled in August 2018 when he paid $830,22 but he 
failed to submit documentation, such as receipts, letters, cancelled checks, or account 
statements reflecting either continuing monthly payments or payment plans. 
Although Applicant has “definitely been thinking about” financial counseling, he has 
never had it.23 During the hearing, Applicant said his current annual salary was over 
$120,000.24 After the hearing, he submitted a Personal Financial Statement reflecting a 
monthly net income of $7,237; monthly expenses of $5,281; with a monthly remainder of 
$1,290 that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.25 However, based 
on the figures furnished by Applicant, his actual annual salary is approximately 
$125,000.26 Among the debts listed in his Personal Financial Statement, Applicant 
indicated that he was making monthly payments on four of his current wife’s accounts,

19 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal 
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to 
evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider 
whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular 
provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis 
under Directive § 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 
02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also

Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant’s unlisted and unalleged 
delinquent accounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above.

totaling $250; and two of his own accounts, totaling $416. He noted that three accounts 
for which his ex-wife was partially responsible were closed as part of her bankruptcy, and 
he was not making any payments for them. There is no mention of any monthly payments 
of $121 being made on the marital credit card that had an unpaid balance of $21,438.27 
In fact, Applicant’s banking and debit card withdrawals and purchases for the period July 
26, 2018 through September 24, 2018, while reflecting numerous restaurant expenditures 
(often several times in the same day), there is not one payment of $121.28  
Character References 
 The manager, information technology services, has known Applicant for nearly ten 
years, and he considers Applicant to be an “absolutely critical member of our 
organization.” Applicant has a unique and extremely valuable combination of technical 
expertise and effective interpersonal skills that make him the go-to person to work the 
most difficult challenges.29 Several co-workers and friends who have known Applicant for 
varying periods characterize him as a good moral and honest person; a person who 
strives to do the right thing in all situations; highly professional and trustworthy; and as an 
honest, hard-working person with integrity and reliability.30  
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.”31 As Commander in Chief, the President has 
the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to 
determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such 
information. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to 
grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information “only upon a finding that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.”32   
 
When evaluating an applicant’s suitability for a security clearance, the 
administrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief 
introductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying

conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant’s eligibility 
for access to classified information. 
 
An administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules 
of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are 
applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known 
as the “whole-person concept.” The administrative judge must consider all available, 
reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in 
making a meaningful decision. 
 
In the decision-making process, facts must be established by “substantial 
evidence.”33 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish 
a potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced 
substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive ¶ E3.1.15, the applicant 
has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation 
or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government’s case. The 
burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.34  
 
A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary 
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship 
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is 
because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high 
degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified 
information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the 
applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such 
decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather 
than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, “security clearance 
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”35  
 
Clearance decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense 
be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”36 Thus, nothing in this 
decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in 
part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
                                                          
33 “Substantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as 
adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.”  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 
at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive ¶ E3.1.32.1).  “Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla 
but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 
1994).

patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines 
the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In 
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, 
and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing 
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. 
 
Analysis 
Guideline F, Financial Considerations  
  
The security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set 
out in AG ¶ 18:        
  
Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial 
obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be 
caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other 
issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental 
health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An 
individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to 
engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. 
Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a 
security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including 
espionage.  
  
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under 
AG ¶ 19:   
  
(a) inability to satisfy debts;  
  
(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  
  
(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  
  
(e) consistent spending beyond one’s means or frivolous or irresponsible 
spending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant 
negative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other 
negative financial indicators.  
  
A home mortgage was foreclosed in 2016, leaving a deficiency balance of 
$24,777; a line of credit in the amount of $27,069 was charged off in 2016; and three 
medical accounts were placed for collection. Because Applicant and his ex-wife were 
jointly responsible for the mortgage and line of credit, and she filed for bankruptcy under 
Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to avoid her financial responsibility, Applicant has 
been reluctant, if not unwilling, to satisfy those debts regardless of the ability to do so. He 
 
9 
                                      
 
claimed to have insufficient funds to make payments on several accounts. AG ¶¶ 19(a) 
19(b), 19(c), and 19(e) have been established.  
     
The guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security 
concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG ¶ 20:  
 
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;37 
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear 
victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; 
 
(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the 
problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit 
counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being 
resolved or is under control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay 
overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;38 and 
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue. 
 
                                                          
37 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because “an 
applicant’s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed 
as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.” ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). 
 
38 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts: 
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term ‘good-faith.’ However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith ‘requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.’ Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or 
statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the “good-faith” mitigating condition].

I have concluded that ¶ 20(b) partially applies, and none of the other conditions 
apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant’s continuing financial difficulties 
make it difficult to conclude that they occurred so long ago or were so infrequent, or that 
they were unlikely to recur. In fact, they continue to this day. Applicant attributed his 
financial problems to several different factors: his lengthy separation and eventual 
divorce; maintaining two households during the period of separation; he was ordered to 
pay child support and alimony; after being notified of a layoff, he was offered a new 
position with the same employer which required that he relocate, at his own expense, to 
a different state; and although his primary residence was on the market for over six 
months, it did not sell. The significance of those factors has not been satisfactorily 
supported by appropriate documentation. Applicant did go through a lengthy separation 
and divorce. Paying child support and alimony to the woman to whom he was married for 
nearly three decades would not be unexpected, in-as-much he would have been 
responsible for them had the separation and divorce not occurred. While he was notified 
of an expected layoff, he was never actually terminated, and instead, he moved to a 
different position where his salary was increased. 
Although Applicant’s annual salary has been over $100,000 for several years, and 
is currently at $125,000, he has made little, if any, efforts to address his delinquent 
accounts until after he was motivated to do so upon receipt of the SOR. He stopped 
making his monthly mortgage payments in July 2015. He has ignored the deficiency since 
the house was foreclosed and sold at public auction, and he has also ignored the line of 
credit. Instead, Applicant made one extremely modest payment of $195 for a delinquent 
medical account, one year after he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, and only 
months before the SOR was issued. He made two other relatively modest payments of 
$430 and $122 after the SOR was issued. An applicant who begins to resolve his financial 
problems only after being placed on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy 
may be lacking in the judgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over 
time or when the is no immediate threat to his or her own interests.39 There is evidence 
of a repayment plan on a credit card not alleged in the SOR, but aside from the 
agreement, there is no evidence of any payments. With a substantial monthly remainder, 
Applicant could have started making payments on the mortgage deficiency and the line 
of credit well before the SOR was issued, but instead, he has made no efforts to do so. 
Applicant’s minimal efforts to resolve his delinquent accounts, or at least his portion of 
those accounts do not qualify as good-faith efforts. His promised intentions to reach out 
to his creditors, at this late date, are simply insufficient.40

3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). 
 
40 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future was not 
a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially 
responsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-
0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).

Clearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant’s judgment, reliability, 
and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not 
require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An 
applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant 
actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately 
resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a 
requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a 
reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or 
resolution of such issues, one at a time.   
While there is evidence that Applicant never received financial counseling, 
Applicant’s financial situation is sound on one hand, with a good salary and a substantial 
monthly remainder, but, on the other hand, he is ignoring his delinquent debts.  
Applicant’s actions under the circumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, 
trustworthiness, and good judgment.41  
Whole-Person Concept 
 
 Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(d): 
  
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence. 
 
 Under SEAD 4, App. A, ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a 
security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful 
consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have 
evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence 
and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.42  
  
There is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant’s conduct. Applicant is a 
54-year-old employee of a defense contractor, serving as an information systems service 
operations manager since around 1994 with a business unit of one company that was 
eventually purchased by another company. Co-workers think highly of him. He served on 
                                                          
41 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).  
  
42 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-
3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).

active duty with the U.S. Air Force for ten years until he was honorably discharged in 
1991. He was granted a secret clearance in 1981, and has retained that clearance except 
for periods when he possessed a top secret clearance with SCI access. Since his financial 
difficulties commenced, he made minimal payments to resolve three medical debts. 
The disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. 
Although Applicant’s annual salary has been over $100,000 for several years, and is 
currently at $125,000, he has made little, if any, efforts to address his delinquent accounts 
until after he was motivated to do so upon receipt of the SOR. He stopped making his 
monthly mortgage payments in July 2015. He has ignored the $24,777 deficiency since 
the house was foreclosed and sold at public auction, and he has also ignored the $27,059 
line of credit. In addition, there are non-SOR delinquent debts for $11,674 and $21,438. 
Applicant made one extremely modest payment of $195 for a delinquent medical account, 
one year after he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, and only months before the 
SOR was issued. 
The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in 
financial cases stating:43 
In evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the 
concept of “meaningful track record” necessarily includes evidence of actual 
debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not 
required, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each 
and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant 
demonstrate that he [or she] has “. . . established a plan to resolve his [or 
her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.” 
The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant’s financial 
situation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that 
applicant’s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible 
and realistic. See Directive ¶ E2.2(a) (“Available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be 
considered in reaching a determination.”) There is no requirement that a 
plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, 
a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment 
of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first 
debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones 
listed in the SOR. 
Applicant has demonstrated an extremely poor track record of debt reduction and 
elimination efforts. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts 
as to Applicant’s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, 
I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial 
considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, ¶¶ 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9).

Formal Findings 
 
 Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as 
required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: 
 
 Paragraph 1, Guideline F:   AGAINST APPLICANT 
 
  Subparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:  Against Applicant 
  Subparagraphs 1.c. through 1.e.:  For Applicant 
   
Conclusion 
 
  In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not 
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security 
clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.
