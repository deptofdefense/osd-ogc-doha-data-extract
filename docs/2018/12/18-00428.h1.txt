HARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: 
 
 Applicant’s federal income tax returns were not timely filed for tax years 2011 and 
2014, and his state tax return for tax year 2011 was not filed at the time of his hearing. 
He did not disclose his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax 
year 2011 on his October 4, 2016 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) 
or security clearance application (SCA). Financial considerations and personal conduct 
security concerns are not mitigated. Access to classified information is denied.      
  
History of the Case 
  
On October 4, 2016, Applicant completed and signed his SCA. (Government 
Exhibit (GE) 1) On April 19, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated 
Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant pursuant to Executive Order 
(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 
1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in 
Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for 
Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective 
June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) 
 
The SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that 
it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance 
for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a 
 
2 
                                         
 
clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. (HE 2) Specifically, the SOR 
set forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. 
 
On April 27, 2018, Applicant provided his first response to the SOR, and he 
requested a hearing. (HE 3) On June 1, 2018, the SOR was amended adding and 
clarifying allegations under the financial considerations guideline and adding an allegation 
under the personal conduct guideline. (HE 2) On June 11, 2018, Applicant provided his 
response to the amended SOR. (HE 3) On June 11, 2018, Department Counsel was 
ready to proceed. On July 30, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On August 15, 2018, 
the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting 
the hearing for September 6, 2018, using video teleconference. (HE 1) The hearing was 
held as scheduled.  
  
Department Counsel offered four exhibits; there were no objections to the 
documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 10-15, 19-21; Government Exhibit 
(GE) 1-4) Applicant did not offer any exhibits into evidence. (Tr. 16) On September 12, 
2018, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing.   
 
Findings of Fact 
 
 In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, 
1.g, and 1.h.1 He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s 
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.  
 
Applicant is 32 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor in 
weapons installation since October 2016. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 2003, he received a General 
Educational Development (GED) diploma. (Tr. 6) He is currently seeking an associate’s 
degree in firearms technology. (Tr. 6-7) He served in the Navy from 2004 to 2013. (Tr. 7) 
His Navy specialty was aviation ordnanceman, and his rank when he was discharged was 
petty officer second class (E-5). (Tr. 8) He received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 8)  
 
Financial Considerations 
 
 Applicant had variations in his income, and a period of unemployment after leaving 
the Navy. These circumstances adversely affected his finances. Applicant’s SOR alleges 
the following financial issues: 
 
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.h allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal income 
tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, and 2014. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges he failed to pay his 
federal income taxes as required for tax year 2013.  SOR ¶ 1.g alleges Applicant failed 
to timely file his state income tax return for tax year 2011.  
 
                                            
1 As part of this SOR response, Applicant provided a copy of a federal tax lien filed against his 
father to establish that it was not Applicant’s tax lien. (Tr. 17-18) No adverse inference is made because of 
this tax lien. 
 
3 
                                         
 
Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for each of these tax years as follows: 
2009 filed on January 27, 2011 (Tr. 22-23, 27-28; SOR response); 2011 filed in 
September 2018; 2013 timely filed in April 2014 (Tr. 48; GE 2); and 2014 filed on July 21, 
2017 (Tr. 33).  
 
Applicant’s March 22, 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2013 indicates in 
February 2016 he had additional taxes assessed of $5,007. (Tr. 34; GE 2) He explained 
that he failed to include a withdrawal from his Thrift Savings Program account on his 
income tax return resulting in additional taxes for “unreported income.” (Tr. 33; GE 2) His 
federal income tax refund for tax year 2015 ($1,271) and 2016 ($1,593) were used to 
address his delinquent taxes for tax year 2013. (Tr. 34; SOR response) The IRS 
apparently waived some fees and charges because his 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax 
year 2013 shows a zero pay off amount. (GE 2) A February 27, 2017 IRS letter also 
indicates his tax debt for tax year 2013 has a zero balance. (GE 2) His federal income tax 
debt for tax year 2013 is resolved. 
 
Applicant was deployed as part of his Navy duties for most of 2010 and the first 
few months of 2011. (Tr. 24, 26-27, 29; SOR response) He was waiting for the state to 
provide a copy of his W-2 so he could file his state tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 25, 
30, 45) He was unable to get a W-2 from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service 
(DFAS). (Tr. 46) Applicant’s state tax return has not been filed as of the date of his 
hearing. (Tr. 25, 45-46) 
 
Applicant timely filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2010, 
2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. (SOR response; GE 2) He received a refund for all of 
these tax years. (SOR response; GE 2) 
 
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt owed to a credit union for 
$22,983. In 2012, Applicant borrowed funds to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 35) The vehicle 
was not repossessed. (Tr. 38) He stopped making payments for a time, and then in 
September 2017, he resumed making $200 monthly payments. (Tr. 35, 37) The account 
is in current status. 
 
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges a charged-off debt for $7,245. From May 2017 to April 2018, 
Applicant paid the creditor $200 monthly, and then in April 2018, the creditor offered to 
settle the remaining debt for $3,000. (Tr. 40-41) In April 2018, Applicant paid $3,000 and 
settled the debt. (Tr. 41) 
 
Personal Conduct 
 
When Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he 
did not timely file his federal or state tax returns in 2011. Applicant said at the time he 
completed his SCA, he had forgotten that he did not timely file his tax returns. (Tr. 42-43)  
 
On November 16, 2017, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator 
asked him during his personal subject interview (PSI) whether he failed to file or pay his 
federal or state taxes. (Tr. 47; GE 2) Applicant disclosed that he did not timely file his 
 
4 
                                         
 
federal income taxes for tax year 2013, and he said he paid his tax debt for that year in 
February 2017. (Tr. 47; GE 2) He did not disclose that at the time of his PSI he failed to 
file his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2011. At his hearing, he said he 
could not remember why he did not disclose to the OPM investigator that he had not filed 
his federal income tax return for tax year 2011. (Tr. 47; GE 2) 2 
 
Policies 
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive 
Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, 
“no one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 
518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control 
access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual 
is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The President 
has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant’s eligibility for 
access to classified information “only upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the 
national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within 
Industry § 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  
 
Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the 
criteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not 
inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these 
guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An 
administrative judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense 
decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about 
the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  
 
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with 
access to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and 
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the 
possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified 
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation 
about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance 
                                            
2 Applicant’s SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to disclose that he failed to timely file his 
federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2011 to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) 
investigator. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five 
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  
 
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of 
extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant 
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of 
the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person 
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.  
 
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. 
Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. April 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-
00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). This 
allegation will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above. 
 
5 
                                         
 
decisions must be “in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a 
determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” See Exec. Or. 10865 § 7. 
Thus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or 
in part, on any express or implied determination about applicant’s allegiance, loyalty, or 
patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the 
President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  
 
 Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the 
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from 
being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of 
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. 
“Substantial evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. 
Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines 
presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria 
listed therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 
(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). 
 
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial 
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the 
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it 
is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security 
clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of 
disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-
31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if 
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG ¶ 2(b).  
 
Analysis 
 
Financial Considerations 
 
AG ¶ 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  
 
Failure or inability to live within one’s means, satisfy debts, and meet 
financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or 
unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise 
questions about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to 
protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended 
is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  
 
AG ¶ 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern 
and may be disqualifying in this case: “(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts”; “(c) 
a history of not meeting financial obligations”; and “(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, 
or local income tax returns as required . . . .” Applicant admitted that he failed to timely 
file his federal tax returns for tax years 2009, 2011, and 2014 and state tax return for 
2011. His federal income taxes for tax year 2013 were not paid until 2017. He was late 
paying or making payment arrangements for two debts as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. 
 
6 
                                         
 
The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶¶ 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) 
requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. 
 
Seven mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 20 are potentially applicable: 
  
(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred 
under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt 
on the individual’s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  
 
(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond 
the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, 
unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the 
individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  
 
(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or 
there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under 
control; 
 
(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or 
otherwise resolve debts;3   
 
(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the 
past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented 
proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions 
to resolve the issue; and 
 
(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and 
 
(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority 
to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those 
arrangements. 
 
The Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant’s responsibility for proving the 
applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  
                                            
3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a “good faith” effort to repay overdue 
creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  
 
In order to qualify for application of [the “good faith” mitigating condition], an applicant must 
present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some 
other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant’s debts. The Directive does not 
define the term “good-faith.” However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-
faith “requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, 
honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.” Accordingly, an applicant must do more than 
merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in 
order to claim the benefit of [the “good faith” mitigating condition].

7 
                                         
 
Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant’s security clearance 
eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of 
a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th 
Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government 
presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the 
applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive ¶ E3.1.15. The 
standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in 
Egan, supra. “Any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access 
to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.” 
Directive, Enclosure 2 ¶ 2(b).  
 
ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  
 
No mitigating conditions apply; however, Applicant presented some mitigating 
information. He had variations in his income, and a period of unemployment after leaving 
the Navy. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant’s control and caused or 
contributed to Applicant’s financial problems. He established a payment plan to address 
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e, and he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. He was deployed for most of 
2010, which delayed filing his tax return for tax year 2009. His federal income tax debt for 
tax year 2013 is paid. Applicant is credited with mitigating the financial allegations in SOR 
¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f.   
 
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 
2014. He failed to file his state income tax return for tax year 2011. The DOHA Appeal 
Board has observed: 
 
Failure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary 
compliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified 
information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we 
have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting 
debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By 
the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax 
returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant’s 
judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her 
legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment 
and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. 
See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See 
Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 
183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff’d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 
 
ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 
2002)). ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board 
clarified that even in instances where an “[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the 
applicant’s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent 
such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant’s 
 
8 
                                         
 
security worthiness in light of [applicant’s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing 
irresponsibility” including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case 
No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing “no harm, no foul” 
approach to an Applicant’s course of conduct and employed an “all’s well that ends well” 
analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus 
on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   
 
Applicant repeatedly failed to timely file his tax returns. Financial considerations 
security concerns are not mitigated.  
 
Personal Conduct 
 
AG ¶ 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: 
 
Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or 
unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions 
about an individual’s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect 
classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to 
cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.  
 
 AG ¶ 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be 
disqualifying in this case: “(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant 
facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, . . . 
determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .” 
   
When Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he 
failed to timely file his federal or state tax returns in the previous seven years. At his 
hearing, Applicant said at the time he completed his SCA, he had forgotten that he did 
not timely file his tax returns. This explanation is not credible.  AG ¶ 16(a) is established 
for his failure to disclose accurate information about filing his tax returns on his SCA.   
 
AG ¶ 17 provides five conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security 
concerns in this case: 
 
(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, 
concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; 
 
(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is 
so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is 
unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, 
trustworthiness, or good judgment; 
 
(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling 
to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the 
stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, 
 
9 
                                         
 
unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to 
recur; 
 
(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability 
to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and  
 
(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable 
reliability. 
 
When Applicant completed his October 4, 2016 SCA, he failed to disclose that he 
failed to timely file his federal or state tax returns for tax year 2011 and his federal income 
tax return for tax year 2014. During his OPM PSI, he disclosed that he did not timely file 
or pay his federal income tax return for tax year 2013; however, he brought proof to the 
interview that his federal tax debt for tax year 2013 was paid. At his hearing, he said he 
did not remember that he failed to timely file tax returns for tax year 2011, and he said he 
could not remember why he did not disclose to the OPM investigator that he had not filed 
his federal income tax return for tax year 2011. None of the mitigating conditions apply. 
Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.   
       
Whole-Person Concept 
 
Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an 
Applicant’s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant’s 
conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine 
adjudicative process factors listed at AG ¶ 2(d):  
 
(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the 
circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable 
participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the 
individual’s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to 
which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation 
and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; 
(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the 
likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  
 
Under AG ¶ 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security 
clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration 
of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under 
Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG ¶ 2(a) were 
addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  
 
Applicant is 32 years old, and he has been employed by a defense contractor in 
weapons installation since October 2016. He is currently seeking an associate’s degree 
in firearms technology. He served in the Navy from 2004 to 2013. His Navy specialty was 
aviation ordnanceman, and his rank when he was discharged was petty officer second 
class. He received an honorable discharge.

Applicant’s history of failing to timely file his federal income tax returns for 2011 
and 2014, and his state tax return for 2011, raises unresolved financial considerations 
security concerns. He may owe state income taxes for tax year 2011.4 When an issue of 
delinquent taxes is involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how long an 
applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS or a state generates the tax 
returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete 
making payments.5 The primary problem here is that Applicant has repeatedly been late 
filing his tax returns. He did not provide a good reasons for not timely filing his federal 
income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2014 and his state income tax return for tax 
year 2011.  
 
 Applicant’s intentional falsification of his SCA was in a security context, and that 
falsification raises a serious security concern. The protection of national security relies on 
Applicants to self-report conduct that jeopardizes security, even when that disclosure 
might damage the Applicant’s career. AG ¶ 15 emphasizes, “Of special interest is any 
failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security 
investigative or adjudicative processes.” Applicant cannot be trusted to disclose 
potentially derogatory information. He did not establish his reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information. 
 
I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, 
and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial 
considerations and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.

clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, and stating “A security clearance represents 
an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor 
other obligations to the Government has a direct bearing on an applicant’s reliability, trustworthiness, and 
ability to protect classified information.”). 
 
5See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance 
and stating, “His delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only 
after his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated 
himself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone 
entrusted with the nation’s secrets.”); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing 
grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed corroboration of circumstances beyond applicant’s 
control adversely affecting finances, noting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant’s 
wages, and emphasizing the applicant’s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 
(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and 
insufficient discussion of Applicant’s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 
(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and 
cited applicant’s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns 
for tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except 
for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income 
of over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse’s medical 
problems. The Appeal Board emphasized “the allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first 
place stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with 
complying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and 
systems is essential for protecting classified information.” Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 
(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).
