KEYWORD: Guideline F
DIGEST: Applicant contends that the Judge failed to consider significant record evidence, such
as the circumstances underlying his financial problems, his efforts to resolve the debts, and his
good security record.  Applicant’s argument is not enough to rebut the presumption that the
Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the
evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Adverse decision
affirmed.

APPEAL BOARD DECISION
APPEARANCES
FOR GOVERNMENT
James B. Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel
FOR APPLICANT
Anthony J. Kuhn, Esq.
The Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness designation. 
On May 19, 2017, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that
decision–trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of
Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant
requested a hearing.  On February 5, 2018, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and
Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant’s request for a
trustworthiness designation.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive ¶¶  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.
Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge’s adverse decision was
arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.
The Judge’s Findings of Fact
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1996, and his debts were discharged
in 2001.  In about 2009, Applicant’s in-laws moved in with him because of the father-in-law’s
illness.  The father-in-law died in 2011, and the mother-in-law bought a house of her own. 
Applicant spent over $5,000 to assist his in-laws in 2011 and currently subsidizes the mother-in-law
with about $300 a month.  Applicant’s SOR listed six delinquent debts, four of which the Judge
resolved in his favor.  The two debts that resulted in adverse findings were credit cards or lines of
credit.  Applicant made inconsistent statements about the nature of these debts, for example
describing one of them (for about $3,500) as a credit card in his prior security clearance application
but denying any knowledge of it in his current interview. He told the investigator that the other debt
(for about $3,300) was a credit card but testified at the hearing that it was a signature loan.  Both of
these debts are unresolved.  Applicant’s wife is an accountant, who makes about $90,000 a year. 
Applicant earns about $70,000 a year from his job as a Government contractor.  Applicant has
experienced no unemployment since 1988.  He testified that he had contacted his creditors in 2017
and that they all wanted payment in full.  He claimed to have been saving to pay his debts and
intends to resolve them in the future.  Applicant has about $100,000 in a 401(k) plan and does not
know if his wife has any investments.  His wife is paying off student loans.  Applicant does not
know if his wife maintains a budget.
The Judge’s Analysis
The Judge noted that Applicant has resolved some of his debts, although he did not take
action until after receipt of the SOR.  Though noting his assistance to his in-laws, the Judge
concluded that he had not demonstrated responsible action in regard to his debts.  The Judge stated
that the remaining debts are not large but that Applicant has not addressed them despite having had
many years in which to do so.  She concluded that Applicant has not established a track record of
financial reliability.
Discussion
2
Applicant contends that the Judge failed to consider significant record evidence, such as the
circumstances underlying his financial problems, his efforts to resolve the debts, and his good
security record.  Applicant’s argument is not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge
considered all of the evidence in the record or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence
in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-06452
at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2017);  ADP Case No. 12-09387 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, 2016).  We
conclude that the Judge  considered the totality of the evidence in reaching her decision.  See
Directive ¶ 6.3. 
The decision is sustainable on this record.  The standard applicable to trustworthiness cases
is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding security
clearances:  such a determination “may be granted only when ‘clearly consistent with the interests
of the national security.’” See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-06452, supra.  See also Kaplan v. Conyers,
733 F.3d 1148 (Fed. Cir. 2013), cert. denied.
